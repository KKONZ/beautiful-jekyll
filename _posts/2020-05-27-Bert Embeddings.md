title: Bert Sentence Embeddings
subtitle: _Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers_
---

## Review Similarity

* Huggingface, pre-trained model released by Google that ran for many, many hours on Wikipedia and Book Corpus, a dataset containing +10,000 books of different genres

* can use these models to extract high quality language features from your text data, or you can fine-tune these models on a specific task 

### Yelp data/preprocessing


* Subset reviews to those containing restaurante businesses and have the word pizza in the review.

* Split each review into one sentence segements, tokenize each sentence into bert format and convert to tensors representations

### Limitations of Bert

* Bert is limited to 512 characters

* Pretrained hugging face model is tuned for next sentence predictions 

* Used 2nd to last layer of pretrained Bert model on each sentence of a review

### Innovation for this project

* Concatenated each sentence embedding into a single tensor

* Averaged concateated embeddings (have heard of first and last chunks of sequence and text summarization to reduce the text to 512 limit)

the heart of Chinatown, I discovered it enroute to Kensington Market one day.,It's quite hard to see, if you don't know it's there.,First experience was very positive - would definitely return!.,ATMOSPHERE: Small space.,Think Banh Mi Boys, and other trendy over-the-counter eateries.,Vibe is casual.,Free WiFi is nice. .,SERVICE: Okay.,Staff does their job, but not overly helpful upon entering the space.,Maybe because it's an over-the-counter style place, but it would have been nice to be walked through their ordering process and menu. .,PRICE: Average.,Depends on the size of pizza you order.,The small pizza ($7-9. 50) is filling for one.,Large size pizza ($13-18. 50) is good for sharing. . . or one VERY hungry person.,Pasta portions are very generous for the price tag ($9-14). .,FOOD: My friends and I were here for the first time, and we thought it was a pizza place so we all ordered pizza.,It wasn't until we were waiting for the food to come, that we looked around and realised EVERY other table around us only had pasta on them.,Guess we gotta come back to try! We did notice that the menu said their pasta is homemade.,So will definitely come back. .,Here's the pizza we ordered:.,Peking Duck Pizza - Very tasty! Rich flavours that work well.,But it's heavy, so come hungry - or order to share. .,Margherita - Good, but not the best.,I recommend trying the more \"special\" toppings instead. .,Shall return, and/or try other locations.","First time eating there and everything was so yummy! Great pizza and Salad, my son had the meatball sub he said it was very good, must have been because he wouldn't share.,Highly recommend.","There wasn't one specific thing that made this buffet so horrible. . .,It's just the accumulation of everything being less than average quality.,There are plenty of options, but none of them were flavorful, hot, or worth filling up on. .,Some others have commented on the dessert section being worthwhile, but to us everything tasted unthawed and on the stale side.,The Asian section had probably the best offerings but all were still fairly bland. .,The worst part is that when I was going to grab a slice from the pizza station, someone had placed the tongs directly on TOP of the pizza. . .,So all the hand germs were in direct contact with the food! There were two workers right there who didn't think this was disgusting. .,I would have discarded the slices. .,My husband and I both left with unsatisfied stomachs and looked forward to the second dinner we would have a few hours later at a much better establishment.","So I don't give out 5 stars frivolously, but this place deserves it.,Everything I had (summer rolls, vegan pizza burger and chocolate chip cookies) was delicious.,The service was great and the waitress helped me narrow down the never ending yummy looking options on the menu.,They even gave me a smoothie sample while I waited. .,Next time I'm in Cleveland, I'll definitely stop back in.,I may even be coming for dinner today.","More than just  Pizza.,This location is small but cozy.,Has two large screen TV's for your entertainment pleasure. .,The pizza is of better quality than most (a definate step up from Pizza Hut and Domino').,The thin crust is we like here.,The crust has a crunch to it, which I prefer.,Their menu has a \"tailgate\" variety of food (Pasta, Ribs, Fried Chicken, sub sandwiches. . . . . . you get the picture). .,The prices are bit high for what you get.,They do have specials so that is what our family typically goes for. . . . .,Familiy Feast ($22) includes 16' pizza with one topping, 6 wings, 4 garlic sticks, and 2 liter of pop. .,We are planning to keep this place on our list of places to think about  for a weekday \"too many kid activities\" and \"too tired to cook\" take out night.","My absolutely favorite mushroom pizza in the city, Great brunch spot - really reasonable and you can always get a table, because it's really big and has indoor and outdoor space.,I think the ice cream is homeade.,A neighbourhood favorite!","2015 St. Patrick's Day Festival highlights: Saturday morning parking was available for free at 1) Parking Garage near City Hall, located at Basic Road and Lead Street.,Accessed from Basic Road and 2) Parking Garage near Justice Facility, located at Water Street, near Basic Road.,Accessed from either Water Street or Texas Avenue. .,A must see is the  Carrolier Academy of Irish Dance! The children participated in the parade and scheduled events throughout the weekend.,Led by Debbie Carroll and Shelley Locklier, the two dancers have Irish dance teaching credentials; both teachers travelled the world with Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance. .,Fun for the children included the ferris wheel and carousel.,Since the Las Vegas Valley does not have a permanent ferris wheel and carousel to ride, we enjoyed taking a twirl on both.,Ferris wheel tickets were 4 tickets per person.,Carousel tickets were 3 per person, but an adult is free if standing next to small children who are on the ride.,Each ticket = $1. 25. .,I would like to see a greater use of food trucks.,We saw pizza, Mexican, Filipino, hot dogs, cupcakes, and snowcones.,Come on Las Vegas Valley food culture, come out and show us what you offer.","The pizza wasn't very warm when it arrived (they didn't use the warming bag at time of delivery) and the order was wrong, but the pizza tasted good.","When I walked into Epicure Cafe today it was like bizarroland - like when you come home from vacation and sense that everything isn't in its right place.,You know you're at home, but someone's moved something, rearranged the furniture, or otherwise changed things ever so slightly but just enough to make you suspicious.,This wasn't the Epicure Cafe that I remember from three or four years ago. .,I learned from Jackie, our cutesy server who was a total dupe for actress Clea DuVall, that a few years ago Epicure changed locations.,To a few doors down farther east on Queen, on the same side of the street.,Which explains the slightly-different-but-not-quite layout, decor and seating.,It was a pleasant surprise.,I didn't venture upstairs but I was told there's an outdoor eating area that will have to be explored on my next visit. .,The menu options are, like others have said, a bit overwhelming.,But for the fussy eater (I was with one of them) there was no lack of choice - Epicure has everything from pasta (17 choices, including different sauces and shapes), burgers, pizza, wraps and another full page of duck/veal/lamb/chicken options.,I appreciate the selection but it could stand to be honed a little! Luckily Jackie was able to recommend favourites when we showed indecision. .,My eyes went straight for the Pumpkin Ravioi ($14), which I was assured was \"not a mistake\".,And it wasn't.,I barely looked up my from my plate as I feasted my eyes on the glorious, pillowy ravioli on my plate.,They were seasoned with ginger and nutmeg, tossed in parmesan cream sauce with grilled corn, wilted spinach and mushrooms.,The mushrooms were perfectly sauteed, the spinach was wilted just right and the corn was fresh and added the exact amount of crunch that the dish needed.,The portion wasn't skimpy either - at some restaurants when you order jumbo ravioli you get 3-4 pieces, but this was more than double the size.,Good value for the money. .,I was more than tempted by the dessert board (tartufo, ice cream, tiramisu, Grand Marnier cheesecake or cr\u00e8me caramel, Belgian chocolate mousse, apple crumble) but unfortunately dinner left me positively STUFFED. After seeing that Epicure is now open until 1 or 2am every night I know where I'll be heading for late night dessert!","The pizza is very, very good! We arrived 15 minutes before closing time and the restaurant staff were very accommodating!","After making idiot faces through the window at the employees of Spicy Pickle, employees who were most likely tired after a long day of training, my husband and I were invited to lunch the next day- a training activity for the staff.,Only friends and family were invited.,We felt very special- either to be considered part of the Spicy Pickle family, or maybe because we made such ridiculous fools of ourselves at the window that they thought we might be \"special\" in the other meaning.,Perhaps. .,Either way, free lunch. .,It's not as though I could give a stinky review to anything given to me for free- I might feel bad- but this was just what the doctor ordered. .,Not for the weak at heart. .,It's not just a clever name.,Their pickles are actually spicy.,They seems to be lightly dusted with some kind of chile powder.,A nice kick follows a good bite. .,I ordered the Dilly something or other.,It was half a sandwich (sub or panini) with a bowl of soup.,I chose the Corn and Green Chile Bisque with the Sausalito Bandito panini.,Delish! It also passed my spicy- enough- for- me- test.,Yes, I needed multiple napkins for my nose. .,I could have taken a little more spice, so next time I might ask them to kick it up a notch, but it was a refreshing foray back to my traveling days when I tried to convince a chef in India that, no, I am actually not white.,I just have REALLY light skin.,Never worked. .,Al had the Aztec pizzeti.,Coming from NY, I am particular about pizza.,This looked like it fit the bill.,Very think and crispy crust.,A little too much cheese for my taste, but most people out here like it like that.,She loved it, along with her bowl of loaded potato soup. .,Mickey had the Gobbler with a side salad.,When she bit into the panini she made a face that I think should remain in the bedroom.,Enough said. .,Bryan had the salad and enjoyed it immensely.,It didn't look like much, but I might have to return when they open tomorrow and try it out for myself.,The croutons did look very appetizing. .,One of the attentive staff members made the rounds with a tray of mini chocolate chip cookies.,Fantastic.,Crispy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside.,Mama like. .,All in all, I'll be back.,Probably tomorrow.,And maybe the day after. . . .,AMENDMENT:. OK, so I did go back the next day. . . and today (which is the following day).,Yesterday I had the tuna salad, which was delish.,Theur tuna is a little kicked up, as it's made with chipotle mayo (but really not too much) and spoicy pickle relish.,Tasty.,It was served over a bed of greens with a lemon olive oil dressing. .,Today I had the med sub.,It was ok- nothing out of the ballpark.,I got it with the spoinach salad, which was also delish. .,Down to 4. 5, but alas no halfs. . . .,Stick with the paninis and the salads.,Maybe the soups too.,I have yet to try the pizzetti. . . stay tuned.","This is probably my favorite bar in Pittsburgh.,The pizza is solid, the hot dogs are great, and the beer cave. . . mmmm.,My only complaint is that they haven't opened another one on the other side of town!","Fast Forward.,Every trip from NYC to Pitt includes a visit to Aiello's.,And if we know anyone driving East, we request a transfer!.,If you are in search of fancy \"gourmet\" pizza, go elsewhere. .,At Aiello's, you order the pizza you specify - and it is absolutely perfect!","The building is lovely.,The remodel after Buttita's is as good as one can do when turning a lovely restaurant into a sports bar-style restaurant (though why one would want to do that is beyond me).,And that's where the good stuff stops. .,In short, the service and all things related to it were glacially slow; the food, when it arrived, was mediocre at best -- and missing key elements (one whole order, and other parts).,This restaurant cannot possibly last if they don't figure out how to greet and serve customers, or get the food that was ordered actually to the tables. .,The full story. .,Upon arrival, we found a vacant hostess stand, then a long walk down the hall to the dining room along which we saw no one who works there.,Luckily, we ran into friends who assured us that we could seat ourselves. .,After waiting at our table for some 15 minutes, we used a bit of self-help, and accosted a waitress to ask for some menus.,After another 5-7 minutes another waitress finally showed up with menus and silverware.,She did not offer water, or to bring us a drink of any sort - just plopped the menus down and disappeared. .,Quite some time later, our waitress arrived, apologetically, and took our order.,We ordered an appetizer (cheese fries), and three meals: 1 burger (would have been on wheat bread but despite the menu, they had none), one 1/2 ribeye (which the menu says was supposed to be thick, but which was certainly not), that should have come with some interesting sounding twice baked potato casserole, and one individual pizza.,My daughter ordered a diet, I ordered water, and my husband ordered a beer. .,The water and diet only took about 7 minutes to arrive. .,The appetizer might have arrived after another 10, but the food runner carrying the plate of cheese fries tried to deliver them to another table.,Having learned he had the wrong table, the lad just took them back to the kitchen. .,Eventually, the cheese fries arrived.,They weren't as hot as one would like, and for the price, there should have been a LOT more cheese.,The fries were no better than I could make using frozen crinkle fries from the grocery. .,Within 3 minutes of the appetizer's tardy arrival, some of our food arrived. .,The burger (but not the beer), and my steak with vegetable, but no potato casserole, and no pizza. .,The waitress arrived, and asked if everything was there, we told her \"no\", and pointed out that we were missing the beer, the potatoes and the pizza.,Ten minutes later the beer arrived. .,My husband then went up to the window where the pizza would have been put up for a food runner -- no pizza had been ordered. .,So. .,The steak was fatty, but moderately tasty, if only tepid.,The broccoli was cold, the burger was not as good as you can get at, say Hardee's (despite costing twice as much). .,We never did get the pizza.,Or the potatoes.  .,I DID offer to come in as a consulting manager to help them teach the staff how to actually wait tables. . . . . .","Probably one of my favorite pizza places.,Food is always good and the brick oven is a nice touch you don't see everywhere.","Are you looking for an organic, unique, and historical restaurant?,Than Joes Farm Grill is the place for you.,Even if you have simple tastes Joes Farm Grill will have something to suit your needs.,It has beautiful decoration, great food and affordable prices, so why not pay a visit. .,Joes Farm Grill has a long historical background, with a house originally built in 1966 by the Johnston family.,In later years it was decided to turn the farm into a restaurant with its food being home grown or locally brought in.,The house development around the farm is Agritopia, and was dedicated to permanent urban farming.,In fact if you live in the development surrounding the restaurant you can rent a garden lot to grow vegetables.,All of their products are certified USDA organic, and their focus is common food done uncommonly.,They feel fresh food taste better and are better for you so why not share all that with the customers.,They take the foods taste to a new level with all of the recipes and ingredients. .,Joes Farm Grill is delicious, unique and a fun experience.,I feel most restaurants are chains and don't have the history behind them like Joes does, and because of this it makes the experience much more special.,Knowing your food is organic makes it taste ten times better, and knowing you don't have to spend a fortune for organic makes me want to go again.,It's really stands out among most and everyone in the chandler area needs to stop by and visit. .,First walking up to the twelve acre masterpiece is like going through a farm, with orange trees covering the path and large oaks surrounding it which gives a beautiful green glow of a garden.,It smells fresh and gives you an earthy vive.,They are enormous and full of green vegetables that look extremely appetizing.,They are covering most of the land and you can walk through them and see your food growing.,The building is white with large windows showing the back and the front equally, and the inside has simple decorations with light blue and green accents not to overpower the beauty of the vegetation growing outside.,It holds no more than a hundred people and is rather spacious seating.,The entire restaurant is very simple with a 60s feel mixed with a futuristic time.,I ordered the jumbo breaded shrimp with fries, French toast banana peanut butter sandwich and the barbeque chicken pizza.,I went with my sister because the portions are rather large and I could not have eaten it by myself.,This was my first time visiting the restaurant and my sisters second.,Everything so far was very pleasant and the employees were very nice.,No more than ten minutes later our food was ready and it looked and smelt great.,We sat down and I tried each dish, starting with the shrimp which were very large.,The shrimp was crunchy and juicy and was simple and not overpowering.,I thought it tasted very good and wasn't too rich which is a problem I normally find when ordering shrimp.,Then I tried the French toast peanut butter sandwiches that surprisingly had strawberry's in it too.,This was one of the best tasting things I have ever had! It was a house specialty and lives up to its name.,It tasted like a gourmet peanut butter sandwich and was so flavorful and sweet.,I had to order another one.,Then I tried the barbeque pizza, I liked it but it wasn't my favorite.,It was thin crust and slightly burnt, but it did taste good with the cheese and chicken combination.,It just tasted like there was too many ingredients on the pizza that overpowered it.,The prices weren't that bad either, the shrimp was the most expensive at 14. 99 when I go again I probably won't order this again, just because it wasn't a to die for dish.,The peanut butter sandwiches were 10. 99 and I crave these every day it was amazing! Than last the pizza was 12. 99, my sister liked it more than I did so it depends on your taste but I probably will try something else. .,The most important part though is the food, and not to leave you hanging was no matter what spectacular.,Fresh fries galore.,The most appealing part to me was the decorations and the gardens surrounding the place.,I think the set up as if you're in a food court is a really interesting concept; you have to throw away your own food on trays, and clean up after yourself.,I didn't expect that and I think it's a smart move on the restaurants part.,The calm and relaxing atmosphere, and no rush pace is really nice. .,I enjoyed Joes Farm Grill and I plan on visiting again.,I think the organic concept and urban farming is a really nice thing to hear about in today's society.,I feel better knowing I'm eating organic, and knowing there are still places that are going strong with the idea of organic.,I hope the success of this restaurant shows others they can do the same.,This restaurant meets all my needs as a customer, clean, green and tasty what more could you want.","A real cozy spot to grab some Greek. .,It's tiny, warm, and feels almost divey, but Crazy Jim's is not a bad place to grab a gyro.,I'm not going to say it tastes the most 'authentic', but it is unquestionably satisfying. .,It starts with the bread, because if you're not ordering a gyro on your first visit, you're doing it wrong.,The pita is T H I C K.,Flavorful.,Heavy.,It serves as a great foundation.,The meat is tasty, the toppings are good and have plenty of customizable options.,I had warm feta to top mine off, and it was great despite almost being too rich.,They are very generous portions. .,You can get pizza, beer, and a variety of other dishes at an affordable price, so you've got nothing to lose by giving it a try! .,Just be warned that parking is a bit of a pain.","Really nice, casual bistro feel.,Quick and easy spot for a light lunch.,Food could be improved. .,The shrimp and avocado appetizer could be improved upon - the shrimp was very fresh but it lacked flavor. .,The grilled octopus was delicious - nicely charred and savory with the chickpeas and tomato sauce. .,The pizza with mushrooms also could be improved upon - the crusty was undercooked and had none of that nice, smoky flavor it should have. .,The mushroom pasta looked really good - lots of mixed mushrooms and very moist.","We like the Manhattan Family Feast. $41. 99 for a REALLY big 1 topping pizza, hot wings, fries, and a large salad.,I do wish another salad came with it since we're big salad eaters.,Good food.,Good price.,Prompt and courteous service.","best New York pizza in Summerlin and p. o pasta dishes look yummy too!  very friendly staff! please come to LA!","I was hungry.,My aunt was hungry.,Those were the only two reasons I went to this place while out visiting Boulder City. .,The pizza portions were ridiculously huge, but y'know, there was nothing special about this place other than its cheap prices.,The cheese on my slice was overly greasy and no matter what you do, NEVER order their fries because they're out to make you fat.","If Giordano's is looking to compete with Lou Malnati's, they are going to have to improve their dough recipe.,The crust tasted like a flaky hard biscuit which is not pleasant on pizza.,Lou Malnati's dough has a wonderful yeasty dough flavor while Giordano's doesn't taste like much at all, same as their garlic parmesan french fries.,C'mon give us garlic, we can handle it!.,To someone who just shoves food in their face and doesn't overly think about it, Giordano's is fine, but if you consider yourself a pizza buff you will probably be let down after the fourth bite. .,Overall Giordano's is not horribly disgusting but it isn't impressive either.,They could also stand to hire extra staff to be refilling drinks. . .,If you're looking for a truly spectacular pizza, do yourself a favor and go to Grimaldi's.","This is my last stop on the reign of terror of vegan hotspots in downtown Las Vegas.,It's a pizza shop in the plaza hotel with a vegan slice called the soho.,It's pretty majestic, including spinach, artichoke, and the Daiya cheese we all love.,The crust is chewy and delicious.,At other times (like daytime) they offer a vegan soft serve in chocolate and vanilla.,In my case, my 2am pizza trip also featured a drunk twenty year old hitting on me.,Thumbs up!","Fix your store, it is so poorly run that I cannot even go there.,There are never pizzas ready, they don't answer the phone to make orders, the employees are rude and condescending and the customers are trash!.,Our neighborhood is not this gross but if I was from outside the area, I would think it's the slums.,Totally unacceptable, get this store fixed immediately.,No excuses. .,It also has a foul odor to it. . . the pizza is worth 5 or 6 bucks. . . nothing special just fix your stupid store and standards","Went for the 1st. time to CPK on the advice of a friend, there were 8 in our party.,We were seated at a table that was made for 6, kinda cramped for space, we endured because they said the wait for a bigger table would be 20 min.,Although there were 2 areas  bigger than where we sat that were empty.  .,Now when your waitress finally shows for drinks (about 5 min) and the first words out of her mouth are.  \"They must think I'm  wonder woman, I already have a table of 7 and a table of 12\".,Translated= hey guys, your service is gonna suck but that's not my fault.,And it did!!!!.,My wife and I split the pepperoni, sasuage and mushroom pizza, obviously  'shrooms are the cheapest ingredient cause that's about all we could find.,Pizza was bland, 'shrooms  overpowering and service sacked.,If that's what your looking for in a dining experience, then this is the restaurant and location for you.,If not  STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This hot and ready pizza was definitely not the greatest.,The pepperoni is clustered around the center.,The sauce has a spicy kick to it, and neither my children not myself liked it.,The crazy bread is tasty though.","If you're in the area and have a hankering for pizza, head on over to the five50.,Let's call this place a 3. 5.,Midwesterners beware, this is a thin crust pizza joint!.,We were pressed for time and had a 30 to 40 minute window for eating.,The service was accommodating, and they got us in and out just in time.,We ordered one pizza, half North Beach half Margherita.,The slices were large and thin, so one pizza was enough to make two people full at three slices per person.,The pizza was thin crust, but still had a slight chew to go with the crunch which I enjoyed.,The North Beach had smoked mozzarella and clams on it, and was described as bbq chicken pizza with the chicken swapped for clams.,It was unique with tender clam pieces, but I think they planted a dangerous seed since I found myself wishing it had a dash of bbq sauce! The Margherita pizza was nothing special, just a big basil leaf on each slice.","NFL football on and I'm listening to Casey Kasum tip hits from 1978.,What is the target demographic?,This isn't the only time I left due to terrible ambiance.,I'll keep  giving this place a chance because of the happy hour pizza and wings.,I hope they will find an identity.","Stopped in for late lunch, and my son &amp; I agree, this was freshest tasting pizza we've had in a long while!  The girls working here are extremely nice, waited on us, refilled drinks, and cleaned up our table when we were done, and kept smiles on their faces the whole time.,Place is kept very clean too.,I'd definitely recommend!","I went to their pizza \"rodizio\" yesterday, which is happening every Thursday of this month.,For those who still don't know what a rodizio is, I'm saving you a Google search: you pay an amount and waiters keep bringing you food until you say you're full or you explode, whatever happens first. .,I was expecting to eat just pizza, but they had a small pasta and salad buffet that was included in the price of $20/person.,The lasagna was awesome - of course I didn't try everything because I was there for the pizza, after all. .,The pizza slices are smaller than normal so you can try many different kinds.,The \"Portuguese\" (ham, cheese, egg, peas and onions) and the four cheese (mozzarella, parmesan, gorgonzola and catupiry) were the best ones, in my opinion. .,Please, go ahead and make your reservation.,You won't be sorry.","Note: CASH ONLY!. I have yet to conquer their titular menu item, but I can say with absolute confidence and honesty that The Original Gyro of Castle Shannon (formerly a pizza joint) has already vanquished every other Baklava and order of Stuffed Grape Leaves I've ever had the fortune of eating. .,The grape leaves are pouches of gastronomic pleasure that nearly burst with rice and a most delicate ground lamb.,The lavish, honey-kissed, nut-embedded Baklava will simultaneously exercise your jaw muscles and seduce your sweet tooth, suggesting flavors and preparation far beyond their $2 price tag. .,P.,S.,Dig those late hours!","Having just moved to the area, Casey's has been such an amazing place to have available.,They truly have a little bit of everything available 24 hours a day.,Everybody who works here has always been so friendly and helpful.,Their pizza is also really, really, really good.,It's my favorite so far in the area.,Who would've thought???,We have only done carry out up to this point, but they do now offer delivery.,Delivery hours are 4:30 p. m. - 10 p. m.,There is a delivery fee of $2 per order with a minimum purchase of $10 required.,Forms of payment accepted include major credit cards, cash and check.","More like 2. 5 stars.,I'm giving two so the owners will have more incentive to make the necessary tweaks. .,I really wanted to like Strada 241.,It's a beautiful space and the service is friendly, but the food was lackluster.,We split a salumi plate and each had a pizza (I had the 'nduja).,The salumi plate was nice but a little on the small side and lacking in variety, with only three meats.,The pizzas looked good but were pretty tasteless - the cheese was bland, the sauce was bland and missing the necessary balance of tanginess and sweetness, and the crust was dried out and lacking flavor (probably a result of the electric oven). .,I would come back to try the pastas and also to see if the pizza improves.,There's no lack of effort here and the food is honest.","I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant/brew pub.,The beer selection is pretty good here if you want to try different beers, and their food is pretty good.,I came here for brunch which was average, but I really enjoyed the pizza I ordered on a different occasion.,I would recommend this place as a nice spot to go for dinner.","Used to be a good place.,Has gone downhill the last few years.,I already know their pizza is not good anymore, it was when they first opened, but I was in the mood for pasta and decided to give them a chance to redeem themselves . .,I ordered to go and when I got their at 8 pm on a Saturday night and there was only one two person table and no other people in the restaurant, I had a feeling something wasn't right. .,Spent $23. 17 on two pastas to go.,One the was spaghetti with meat sauce, I would compare it to a can of Chef Boyardee.,The other was a pesto pasta with chicken, not very good either. .,Threw them both in the trash.,After this meal, I also threw my Streets of New York takeout menu in the trash","This place really does it right.,They have a small but focused menu, and the food is pretty basic: burgers, wings, pizza, and a few sides.,But you can tell that they do everything from scratch and the quality is outstanding.,I dare say the burger is better than Fatheads right down the street (also a great burger).,Highly recommended!","Very good food &amp; service on our visit.,It's a little pricey, but for quality Chicago deep dish pizza, I don't mind blowing some coin!

First of all just the deco of the place was one big investment as the had it all in there including the Eiffel Tower, Greek wind mill, part of china and italy. .,Then there was the food and since I am careful what I am eating they actually had lots to offer. plenty of veggies, 7 different types of pizza.,A complete turkey which I had but they had roasts of all types.,Which I was told are slow cooked over night. .,Chinese food was good esp. the spring rolls which I have a friend who makes and these were exactly like his. .,The owner gave me a complete tour of the place which seats 800+ yes 800.,He told me saturday nite he is full.,They even had private rooms for conference or weddings etc. . .,Out door on the roof for the summer.,Mind blowing.,Everything is cook in house. .,I will be back.","If you come on a Friday or Saturday after 6 or 7pm, expect to have a bit of a wait.,One nice perk is that they have an open table that you can stand at to enjoy your pre-dinner drinks so you don't have to crowd around those sitting at the bar.,I absolutely love the atmosphere at this place with the big wood-burning pizza oven behind the bar where you can watch your pizza being cooked.,They have a great selection of wines from different countries and their food options are not overwhelming, but always deliver big.,When I went a couple months ago, they had caramelized brussel sprouts that they cooked in the wood-burning oven that were amazing!! I've tried many of their pizzas and haven't had one that I dislike.,My favorites are the Quattro Formaggio and the Spicy Sopressata, which despite the name, is not too spicy.,In the summer, a huge perk to this place is their outdoor patio.,They have a couple long picnic tables and also have smaller tables along the fence.,On a warm spring/summer night, it's very relaxing to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather.","I've totally given up on this place.  .,The staggeringly bad choices for Asian food around Moon / Sewickley are just all around.  .,Since I live nearby, I hit this place as a default setting.,Kung Pao Chicken ($11) and Shrimp Toast ($7. 95).,It adds up in a hurry and by the end of the meal, you wonder, \"Where did it all go?\"  Or if you are feeling a little on the existential side, \"Is that all there is?\".,For the price, the Kung Pao Chicken tastes cheap and rubbery.,On the good side, you get plenty of this cheap and rubbery chicken.,Flavor is just meh.,A bit on the bland side sometimes. .,The Shrimp Toast is OK.  Most times I have ordered this, it comes burnt. .,Since it's mostly pizza places that deliver to our house, Hunan is the only non-pizza option that delivers.,If I order Kung Pao and Shrimp Toast, I easily get to the $15 minimum delivery threshold.,But, in the end, I should have just driven myself to Leetsdale or Robinson for something better. .,On the upside, if you do end up eating inside the restaurant, very nice people work there.,But, the food coming out of that kitchen is just bland, bland, bland.","Dinner at Lago was fantastic, from the setting to the service to the food and drinks.,We sat outside on a beautiful fall evening, with the sights and sounds of Cleveland's Flats gradually coming back to life.,It's a great menu, with lots to choose from.,We had the calamari (sauteed, not fried, in a delicious tomato sauce that was perfect for dipping lots of bread in) and the homemade pasta with meatballs.,It's the best of comfort food, with enough imagination and elegance to make it special.,I had a delicious easy glass of pinot noir and my boyfriend had a gin martini -- we agreed it was exactly how we like our martinis: extremely cold, with just the right balance, and awesome cheese stuffed olives.,Our only disappointment was the mushroom pizza--the crust is nothing special and the toppings were just ok.,We were so happy (and full) at that point, the so-so pizza didn't faze us at all.,We'll just stick to ordering pizza at Humble in Lakewood, and come back to Lago for the pasta.,A great evening all around!","The best thing about this restaurant is their pizza.,Even though it's \"raw\" it's still really tasty and filling.,The BLT is pretty good too, but messy to eat--definitely not a good first date food. .,I think you have to keep an open mind when you go to places like this, because the rawness makes it harder to fool your average carnivore.,I've seen children at nearby tables take one bite, make a face and push the plate away, whereas in places where they cook the vegan food kids will have no idea that they're not eating chicken fingers or whatever the item is. .,The service here is slow.,And when I say slow I mean I aged considerably while waiting for my food.,I wish I could say this only happened once, but it's happened every time I've been there.,I think it's because they make everything from scratch and there are only one or two people working in the restaurant at all times.,If you have three or four tables, you do the math.,It isn't pretty. .,I'm happy to have this place open as an option, but it does not get my highest recommendation.","I recently went to this restaurant with a group of friends as I had heard so many positive reviews and must say Artigiani definately lived up to expectations.,This resto serves up one  of the best wood oven pizza's in montreal.,Their  pizza is thin crust  and  they a have wide variety of pizza's that will please your pallette.,Ambiance is cozy and modern decor.,They also serve up a great seafood pasta dish for all you seafood lovers and must not forget to mention their fried calamari entree.,Lastly, be sure to leave room for their wonderful tiramisu dessert served in a gelato glass.,Would definately recommend!","Solid pizza.,Maybe slightly on the rich side but sometimes that's what you're looking for! Went for this when Pizzaiolo was closed last night and was very happy with the decision.","Great service, decent food.,I went here with my family for dinner and the staff was extremely friendly and nice.,The pizza was ok, we ordered two large pizzas, one was all cheese and the other was half veggie and half buffalo chicken.,My husband said he enjoyed the buffalo chicken the most, I preferred the cheese.,I didn't get to try the veggie but my mom said it was very good.,The bruschetta was very tasty and I would recommend trying it.,We also really enjoyed their pizookie, and if you like warm cookies and ice-cream I would highly recommend trying it!","(2. 5/3) For first timers, this 'restaurant' is organized a lot like a high-tech, italian-only food court.,Walk in and an employee will hand you a handy, dandy card which you use to swipe and accumulate expenses at various food stations (pasta, salad, antipasto, pizza, bar, dessert).,It's convenient and not too crowded.,Apparently the pasta is made fresh daily and they actually cook the dish in front of you--note, this significantly increases your wait time. .,I ordered the Pasta Vongole (one of the specials listed in front of the pasta station - $9. 95).,It was supposed to have white wine, clams, garlic, capers, and anchovies.,However, upon closer inspection, my capers and anchovies must have vanished in thin air.,The pasta is good, but the dish as a whole lacked flavor.,LIke past reviewers, I also found my pasta dry (however, one of my friends had pasta that looked like it was sauced in soup).,Serving sizes are huge though (considering how filling pasta can be).,My friend who got the carbonara said the sauce was much too heavy but he really enjoyed his side caesar salad. \"The anchovy flavor was great. \" I also got the trio of bruschetta ($4. 50) and white chocolate mousse ($2. 75) to go. .,Finally, I had some issues with the card they provided in that it charged me almost $10 more than it should have when I went to check out.,Fortunately, the cashiers were understanding and removed the mysteriously appearing dishes from my check.,Overall, I would give this place a second chance since the fresh-made pasta actually has a great texture and the employees are friendly.,It's also a great alternative to fast food and traditional sit-down restaurants.","Ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats-Unis, j'\u00e9vitais son ouverture \u00e0 Laval comme la peste.,J'ai quand m\u00eame d\u00fb y aller pour faire plaisir \u00e0 une amie.,Un mot : MAUVAIS, tout est mauvais, les p\u00e2tes, les pizza, les frites, TOUT!!!!

Everything is homemade I love it. 24hr delivery and pick up.,The owner is super friendly!!! 5 stars!!!!!","My favorite Giordanos in AZ! The service and food is perfection.,What I appreciate about it is that it's the closest tasting pizza compared to my hometown of Chicago.,We love deep dish and the crust doesn't disappoint.,The sauce is well seasoned which is also something I pay attention to.,This is our family spot.","With a patio sheltered from the noise of 17th Avenue (and growing the herbs used in most of the dinner items) a very large dining space and a menu full of excellent scodellina options, Cibo is a great place for chatty drinks with the girls, chatty pasta with your family or pizza sharing with your date. .,Far from classic, Cibo takes Italian and turns it Calgarian with modern menu items, super-fresh, super local ingredients in dishes you can't help but share and hipster-turned-friendly servers willing to laugh with the guests. .,Cibo is bustling with the hippest of pizza connoisseurs laughing over fig and gorgonzola pie, the trendiest of the Uptown 17th sharing smoked black cod anitpesto and the coolest of Calgary shouting \"you gotta try this!\" passing house-made olives to the next table; all this activity set firmly on the backbone of simply great food. .,Cibo is fun, it's fun to hang out at for a drink, it's fun to talk to people there and it's a fun place to eat. .,T.","Despite other glowing reviews posted about this location, I cannot in good conscience give a good review. .,Vapiano is a European concept Italian restaurant with a hybrid operation - somewhere between a sit-down restaurant (but no wait staff), a cafeteria/buffet (lines at various food stations), and a fast foot place (counter service).,Vapiano straddles these distinctions with technology.,Each customer gets a \"credit card\" to track their purchases then pays upon leaving.,Maybe that works better for pizzas and large shared plates, but it is a bit awkward for couples and small groups.,And if you want something else (another drink, dessert, etc. ), you have to go re-order at the appropriate counter.,Sort of awkward in my opinion. .,Vapiano's concept strongly emphasizes interior design - it even says so on their web page.,And while that is all well and good, two true tests of a restaurant are the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the environment.,Vapiano scores moderately well on the food (slightly better than average Italian), but falters significantly on cleanliness. .,After my food was prepared, I took the tray to a nearby table.,I placed the tray down and noticed there were very small winged insects crawling on the table.,Not sure what they were - really small termites or large aphids?,Bugs and food - not a good combination!  So I changed table two more times and still there were bugs on the tables.,Maybe they were there because of the plants in the restaurant?,I don't know, but since I already had my food, I chose the \"least buggy\" table and finished my meal as quickly as I could.,Guess it could be at least as buggy as sitting outside or having a picnic?,The moderate mid-week crowd that was there seemed to not notice this problem. .,The last table I selected was along the left-side of the restaurant, where there are long white drapes made of a sort of gauzy material.,The drapes hang down to almost table surface height and the tables are perpendicular to the windows.,Well, you can guess what comes next - looking at the drapes, you can easily see that they were absolutely filthy, stained by who-knows-how-many previous meals.,While pasta and marinara sauce can be a bit messy, whoever thought to put white drapes next to a table surface wasn't much of a designer.,A simple solution would have been to rotate the tables 90-degrees so they were parallel with the drapes - harder to stain that way.,Another good solution - replace the drapes with clean ones, or remove them altogether!.,As I left to pay, the hostess asked me how my meal was.,I mentioned the bugs and stains, but she seemed oblivious to this.,Had she heard it before?,Did she not care?,I paid and left. .,Insects and a dirty environment are a deadly combination for future success.,This location needs to get its act together - get rid of the tiny little buggers and clean the drapes. .,I give this Vapiano location 3 stars (average) for food, but ZERO stars for cleanliness.","Love the area, parking was a short walk (and free).,Cute little shop with seating off to the left.,The employees were not friendly nor rude.,They were just. . . there.,However, the lady who brought out our to-go bag was really nice.,Most of the ice cream flavors were \"OUT\" (written in chalk on their massive menu board).,This was 2 hours before closing so that might have had something to do with it.,Still, there were some flavors that I would have loved to try but was unable to and that was disappointing. .,They have metal spoons for the ice cream samples - that was unique and something I've never seen before. .,Sampled the Turkish Coffee and French Toast ice cream, both were yummy but the french toast won (hands down!!!). .,I just realized that I wasn't offered the little \"sample\" scoop on top of my french toast ice cream.,I'll be sure to ask for it when I go next time.,Seems kind of odd that I have to ask though.,If that's their \"thing\", they should offer it to every customer, each time ice cream is ordered.,Oh well. .,My husband and I also bought fries.,He ordered the cheddar bacon fries - pretty tasty with lots of cheese and bacon bits and 1 side of ranch. .,I ordered the chicken tenders and fries which came with 1 side of honey mustard (which tasted more like mustard with a hint of honey).,A boring and safe choice and it tasted, well. . . boring and safe. .,The fries are rather expensive for what they are though.,The pictures of the pizza fries look good but the price, along with it being extra $$$ for pepperoni (wth?), I will surely pass. .,I will most likely make my way back for the ice cream, but not for the fries unless I'm starving and nothing else around seems appetizing.,The fries are pretty good (well, my husband's were) but they are just too expensive and they aren't anything wondrous. .,Spending $22 for doctored fries, small (albeit delicious) ice cream and meh service is a bit unappealing to me.","Sauce has grown on me. . . particularly this location since this is the one I frequently end up at for a quick lunch or casual dinner spot near home. .,I typically order chopped salads at lunch.,The chopped turkey &amp; feta salad is what I had today.,I had them add asparagus, which was a great call if I may say so myself!  The large salad and fresh roll is the perfect lunch. . . fresh, filling, healthy enough, and pretty inexpensive when it comes to designer salads around town.,I also like the spinach, pancetta &amp; goat cheese and the veggie &amp; aged parmesan salads.  .,My husband eats at Sauce often as well. . . he goes for a salad or sandwich.,Last time we were there together, he had the salami, turkey, prosciutto &amp; mozzarella panini.,I had a bite and was pleasantly surprised! It had a nice balance of thin sliced meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and tangy red wine vinegar in between two perfectly grilled pieces of bread.,The thin crust pizzas are pretty decent also.,Depending on your appetite, sharing a pizza and a salad with your companion can work out to be a satisfactory meal. . . .,What I like about Sauce the most?,Fast, friendly, and efficient service in a clean and casual environment.,The moderate pricing is also a big plus in my book. . . especially in this economy.","I thought everything was fantastic.,The food was incredible, the drinks were strong and remarkably tasty, and the feeling at the restaurant was just very upbeat and lively.,To begin we had wine and a bourbon based pre made cocktail.,I really liked the ingenuity of the cocktail where you're given a bottle instead of having to wait for the crafting each time.,We then had the tuna cones, mushroom flatbread, and the brussel sprout salad.,The ahi cones had a nice kick with the sauce and the presentation was awesome.,The flatbread had more of a pizza feel than your typical flatbread which I enjoyed tremendously.,The brussel spirit salad was a nice side with whole pieces of bacon and apple rather than sprinkled as per usual.,I like this heartier rendition better.,The ambiance of the bar is really nice and the staff were great.,I really wish I had a casual bar like this closer to my house on the west side.,Prices are very high so it's not a weekly dining venue, but I highly recommend trying it out if you're looking for a new cocktail bar with amazing food on the strip.","They have good service, beer selection, and the pizza we got was fantastic.,Their spinach dip was more of typical bar food, just alright.","I stopped in here for a slide and a soda one day and was very pleased.,This is real deal great pizza, plus a great atmosphere and fair price.,I have also since learned that this pizza is the go-to for many local businesses, who all swear by it for their lunch purposes.","With all the talk of Rocky's, Toppers and Ian's, this place has in my opinion the best pizza. . .,I've not tried their regular pizza, but their Chicago stuffed style is the best I've had in Madison. .,And their sandwiches are very good as well.,They have a fantastic selection for a pizza delivery place, and they deliver quickly.","Just your typical warehouse club right?,I guess that depends on your definition of typical.,Sam's club has hours just for buisness members starting at 7:00am.,You can also fax in or go online and have them shop for you.,All you do is go in a pay for it. .,They have a few membership levels- Business, Gold Member and Premium.,The Premium level you earn 2% back on all your purchases.,They do give you two cards for the price that you pay, so you can go in with a neighbor and each get a card. .,In addition to electronics, photo lab, optical center, bakery, meat department, they also have a little know \"clearance\" section at each Sam's.,You just have to know where it is.,Also when they are clearancing out merchandise, the price will end in a \"1\".,Most common is . 71 or . 81.,I have picked up 5 pound bags of mixed candy for . 71 a bag, and lots of other deals just by knowing this little secret. .,They do discount their meat the day before they need to pull it from the shelves.,They also will give cookies to children. .,My boys also love the cafe where they get their \"pizza and drink please. \"  Their menu has changed  a lot lately though and I am not sure if I like it.,Prices are very reasonable though. .,They also have gasoline pumps outside which if you know your prices can be a good thing!.,If you are not satified with your membership, you can cancel at anytime and they will prorate your membership refund.,Their refund policy is really good as well.","We were supposed to go to another restaurant in the boulevard, but one of my friends didn't like Alice Fazooli's for some reason, so we ended up coming here on a Saturday night.,The wait time for patio was only a few minutes.,Although it was crowded, the noise level was very low.,People were enjoying their beers and engaging in conversations that you could easily hear.,The service was good as usual.,I got the mushroom and chicken pizza, which is served on the same kind of bread as their Souvlaki.,In fact, the chicken Souvlaki and my pizza tasted exactly the same when I added the Tzatziki sauce.,The pizza was very so-so, and the toppings were so loose on the bread that I had to eat it like a sandwich.,In comparison to the North York branch, the patio is the only bonus. .,What I like about Moxie's is that they cater to every taste.,There's a food option for those who like Greek, Indian, American and Italian.,If you have a crowd that's hard to please, bring them to Moxie's.,Nobody has the right to complain here about the lack of food options!","Buca is a lovely intimate space to celebrate any special event.,The space is a great blend between industrial, rustic and upscale aesthetics.,We had great service and our waitress was very helpful with recommendations. .,We came over the holidays to celebrate a birthday and had a great adventurous meal.,You can definitely come across items that can't be found anywhere else! We started the night with Salumi De Buca and we got the lardo, spalla and the salsiccine.,It was my first time trying lardo in this way, and it's texture was like caramel but tasted like cream.,Very interesting! Next was the Trota, steelhead trout with a yogurt and herbs on top.,The raw trout was fatty and meatier-tasting than tuna sashimi (as a benchmark) but the preparation kept it light and balanced.,The most adventurous dish of the night was the Cervello.,It's basically lamb's brain wrapped in a crispy salty bacon wrap.,It sounds crazy but the brain is very light and has the texture of cream-cheese.,It was a fun dish. .,Of course, if you want to be less adventurous there are plenty of pastas, pizzas and entrees to choose from.,The table next to us had some younger kids and the kitchen was able to accommodate making simple pastas for them.","The service is slow and not very friendly and the pizza tastes store bought.,I've tried to eat here several times with friends. .,But it just doesn't seem to do anything for me. .,There's a Jack in the Box across the parking lot with hot food and friendly service.","We were out of town on a business trip and looking for somewhere local but not too pricy to eat.,We found a flyer for this place in the door of our hotel room so we decided to give it a shot.,The inside of the place is a total dump but don't let that fool you! We ordered three pizzas, two pepperoni and one meat lovers.,Also I had the turkey sandwich.,The pizza was fantastic!!! The crust is thin crust but it's yummy! The cheese and pepperoni are really yummy too! Good quality cheese.,The meat lovers was amazing too! The turkey sandwich was pretty good the only thing I didn't like was that I didn't know it came with onions (the menu only says it comes with cheese) and I don't really like onions but what ever because after I bit into one I just took them off.,Overall would highly recommend this place if you're in Vegas and looking for a good pizza place or a mom and pop restaurant to support. .,P. s.,The prices are fair too it was $20 for a medium pepperoni and a turkey sandwich","Where Humble may have fallen short for other Yelpers in the past, it surpassed expectations for my family and I this past Saturday. .,Let me start by saying we came in during the dinner rush on a Saturday and were able to immediately sit at the bar area.,While the patio and dinning room were packed, the bar seats in front of the wood/stone oven were open! Who wouldn't want to watch them artfully craft delicious food?,I could have sat there alone and been completely entertained.,Instead, the staff dazzled my family and I as we relaxed and perused the menu. .,As far as service goes, I left over a 20% tip if that gives you any indication of how our meal went.,I prefer bar service.,I don't like the over-attention of being seated in dinning rooms and served.,At the bar I always feel like I'm getting a more genuine experience without being suffocated.,The gent at Humble Wine Bar did a great job of exactly that--great, quick service without being bothered.,He took our orders, offered some feedback and even had a witty comeback for dad, who often loves teasing our servers at restaurants.,My mom spilled her beer on her entire pizza and despite insisting she didn't want another pie, he put in an order and didn't charge us.,Like I said, great service. .,My dad loves wine and pizza, which is a big reason why we came here--but mostly the wine.,He enjoyed the two glasses of red he had and compared them to the varieties he had tried on his recent trip to France.,I also enjoyed the rose cava and the red I tried.,But really, any restaurant or bar that offers great sparkling wine or cava by the glass is awesome in my book. .,We ordered the margherita and soppressata pizzas to share.,My mom tried the house salad and my dad and I split the caprese with prosciutto.,Both the salad and caprese dish were delicious.,Where some felt the house salad fell short without adequate dressing, we found it perfectly dressed.,All the flavors of the spicy greens paired with the currants were present without the dressing taking over the entire dish.,And there was no trace of the overuse of oil.,I often make vinaigrettes at home and find a lot of restaurants do them wrong.,They are actually more oil than anything else, but must be properly emulsified to taste balanced.,The caprese was awesome with thick slices of house-made mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes and a light drizzle of balsamic reduction.,The dish also came with two hunks of freshly baked bread and a mound of some of the best prosciutto I've had in a long time.,The pizzas were perfectly cooked right in front of us in their 800+ degree wood stone oven.,The crusts were perfectly bubbled and chewy without being too thick or thin.,The sauce was well-balanced and you could taste their house-made mozzarella melted on top. .,Something tells me I'm going to have a hard time convincing my family to try any other restaurants next time we have plans to eat out in Lakewood.","Ok for $5 - 6  but not good pizza, no  flavor,  good for young children or anyone else who likes bland pizza!  If they want to charge extra for thin crust they should put it in writing! I would rather give my $5. 00 to Little Cesar's!","I'm giving this place 5 stars not because it's perfect, but because I love it.,I have been there twice, and both times I had a great experience.,To be fair,  both times were during a quiet time (sunday evening), but I found nothing lacking.  .,Since the place is indoor/outdoors, there is no air conditioning, but the server was happy to point a fan in our direction when we asked, and kept our water glasses full the whole time.,She was attentive without being annoying, and as I former server I am hyper aware of the quality of service at an establishment.  .,Food was timed perfectly and the portions were great - I kept some for lunch the next day.,The sangria was lovely - clearly made with good wine - and the calamari appetizer was fresh and tender.,My companion had a tikka masala pizza and I had the Madras chicken.,It was great - it had just enough heat to be flavourful without being overly spicey.  .,This was the perfect place to have dinner after seeing the Picasso exhibition at the AGO, and I'm really glad we chose this place.","Delicious pizza! I had the Lambretta special pizza, minus the prosciutto because I was in the mood for vegetarian (I'm sure it's delicious with the prosciutto too though).,It was HUGE but it was thin crust and it was all I was having and I was hungry so I ate the whole thing myself!.,The service was very fast and friendly, and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant were very pleasant and modern. .,I will definitely come back here! The pizza was made from high quality, authentic ingredients, and I didn't feel stuffed in a bad way like I do at other pizza places.,I felt great afterwards.","It's not that I'm 9 months pregnant that I was able to eat an entire pizza here, but that the pizza here is THAT good! First time trying it but will be back again (soon I hope)! Very clean place, very friendly guys helping us with how to order and very good pizza (had I mentioned that?).,Many thumbs up CBP!!!","I have found my new favourite restaurant in Calgary! After a girlfriend suggested Cibo for our dinner date, I admit I was less than thrilled.,Although I had heard good things, a quick menu check online didn't really excite me, I found nothing to be that interesting or drool worthy.,Nevertheless, there we were.,We were seated upstairs at a lovely table near the bar, and I was already hooked.,The decor and ambiance of this restaurant is perfect.,Although it is loud (almost too loud, which would be my only complaint), it's very energetic and fun.,We ordered the aranchini to share, as well as the mixed greens and the prosciutto and pineapple pizza.,Everything was absolutely fantastic.,We also split two desserts and each had a chocolate martini.,Our server was the sweetest little thing and everything came out perfectly timed and expertly cooked.,I was blown away, so I took my boyfriend back the very next week.,We also shared the aranchini and mixed greens, but we had the lamb meatballs and the spaghetti for 2 meal.,Once again, I was blown away by the quality of the food, service, and price! It is seriously a steal to eat here.,I am absolutely in LOVE with Cibo and I will make it a point to return again and again!","My family and I love this place, which was formerly Brooklyn Brothers.,With the change in name and management, things have only gotten better.,My favorite is the Eggplant Parmesan.,Be sure to ask for Nona's sauce, which is chunky and sweet.,The pizza is also great and they now deliver, which is nice for evenings in.","Excellent place for real Italian food!!!.,If you are looking for a REAL Italian family style restaurant, this is THE PLACE!!!.,The setting is like being in Italy.,You will love the atmosphere.,Great experience.  .,This is the best place we have been in Las Vegas.,The service was perfect!! We made a reservation and had to queue only for 3 minutes, when the restaurant was flooded by customers arriving from everywhere.,We had the pasta which is unique, a sublime pizza, an amazing tiramis\u00f9 and cannoli (The list of pastries is delicious) and as we were really happy with the table we got, we decide to get an Italian red wine Chianti. .,Excellent service, food and atmosphere.,Thank you Ninni, Pasquale and Milena. .,I wish you al the best!!","Libertine Social is a fancy gastropub that is a great place to catch up with friends.,Though it is a little pricey for a gastropub, the food is pretty tasty. .,The House Baked Pretzel was baked perfectly, allowing the dough to be light and soft.,The cheddar fondue was the right amount of gooey-ness and was a delicious dip to the pretzel.,The Wood Grilled Sausages were a good sampler of different types of sausages, which were all grilled to perfection, giving the sausages a smokey kick. .,The Black Truffle Pizza had a good ratio of fontina and Parmesan, giving it a nice cheesy and stringy consistency, which is always nice to have with your pizza.,The pizza was topped with slivers of truffles, which accentuated the delicious flavors of the cheese.,But my personal favorite was the Fennel and Sausage flatbread.,The flatbread was thing and crispy, while the sausage was very flavorful and had the right amount of saltiness that was noticeable with the notes of honey that was on the flatbread. .,If you have friends coming into town, Libertine Social is a great place to have some food and drinks while catching up.","Waiter was over the top cheesy.,Talked too much.,A bit obnoxious. .,No gluten-free options for pizza or pasta (Ferro's on St. Clair offers gluten-free options that are amazing - go there instead if you eat gluten-free). .,One of the specials had risotto as a side so I asked if I could just have a small bowl of the risotto as my main and the waiter said no - didn't even go check with the kitchen - flat out no.,Treated me like I was asking them to make risotto from scratch. .,So I ordered a steak instead which was good but if I wanted steak would have gone to the keg in the first place. .,Marcello's is clearly stuck in the past. . . . no variety for those with dietary restrictions.","Short list:.,Great location.,Great design and environment  .,Attentive staff and manager.,Poor food.,Let me say the people are great! The staff really care for their patrons and it is greatly appreciated. .,Unfortunately the food is not up to par as the location and design.,Coming here for a quick beer and getaway, I order the pizza bites as a way sample their dough. 4 pizza pockets for $6 dollars seems reasonable but as I ate, I found that it was unfortunately not worth the money.,The bottoms are soggy and the chef even had the gall to place a pizza pocket that was hallow.,I understand that the chef is new, but that is unacceptable.,I mean, I hate to say this, but hot pocket does a better job than this sad Appetizer.,I want this place to do well, but please take pride in your food and never send out something that is short of a standard you want it to be.","My wife and I visited East West Pizza because we purchased a restaurant. com gift certificate for $2 and we've been questing to find decent pizza in the area. .,Our meal here was mediocre.,We were pleased by the option to have the crust well done (my wife had hers done this way, while I stuck with the regular crust), but the taste was just bland and uninteresting -- totally lacking in the sort of flavour punch that makes a really good pizza. .,I wasn't going to bother writing a review of the place as pizza is a pretty subjective area, however several months ago I received a spam email from East West -- I must have filled out some comment card or something so, I emailed them and asked them nicely to remove me from their list.,They replied, very apologetic, and promised to do so. .,For the next several months, despite this guarantee, I continued to receive spam in my email from East West.,I emailed them again, this time asking more forcefully to be removed from their list and received no reply - just more spam over the next month or two.,Tonight I emailed centurylink, their email host, and reported them for spamming. .,East West Pizza - two stars for mediocre pizza that I never feel the need to taste again, minus one star for being spammers.","I don't get the hype.,Sure the pita bread is good, the produce is fresh, the portion sizes are large and the service quick,  but I found the overall experience to be nothing more than mediocre.,The gyro was bland, the feta and olives were nothing more than grocery store passable, and the seasoning was non-existent. .,Perhaps I am overly critical, having eaten at great Greek restaurants in other cities (I've noticed that ethnic places - Mexican aside - are over rated across the board in Phx), but as a 'Greek' restaurant this place falls flat.,However, as it is a change from the ordinary casual dining venues, and is close to home, I'll likely be back, but next time I'll choose the pizza or pasta, (with a side of pita) as the Greek and 'Crazy' salads did nothing for me.","It's a local favorite for people who live in the Cave Creek area.,The building is split into two venues.,One side is the coffee side.,It opens for those who need an early coffee and maybe a pastry.,They also offer a simple menu of oatmeal, egg/bacon or sausage or what they call their \"Big Ass\" Burrito.,They also have a \"Small Ass\" Burrito if you're not that hungry.,The coffee is their own and  is roasted on the premises.,I love the smell of it when I drive through the town.,Their coffee offerings are equal to what you would find at Starbuck's but they also have some items unique to them.,Their \"Mocaffe\" (Mexican spiced hot chocolate) is one of my faves. .,The wine side is open for lunch/dinner time.,The menus are small, and most items would be considered appetizers.,However, the menu is unique enough that you feel like you are getting a little something special.,It's always fun to make a meal of apps.,Good sandwiches too.,They also do a decent pizza. .,Monday nights, they offer a $5 price on many of their wines.,It's a good time to try some labels that maybe you aren't used to. .,The free WI-FI is a definite plus.,The ambiance is wonderful, overstuffed chairs, art and entertainment in the evening.,I think you'll be pleased.","I have been going to the RWB in Mesa since it opened and the food is pretty darn good.,As a vegetarian I have tried every possible combination of food on the menu that is vegetarian, but I typically will just stick to the pizzas and salad.,The eggplant Florentine is very good too, but the serving is enough to get you through 4 meals!  That is true with most of their food, the portions are large, so don't be turned off by the prices.,I would have to agree on the comments below on the service; it's nothing to write home about.,The only thing I will say is that I know several people who are regulars at the brew and they are treated like gold. . . so maybe there's something us occasional patrons are missing.,If you are area, I would definitely recommend RWB.","Great place.,I went there on the opening weekend and they had a waiting list.,It did seem a little disorganized, people going this way, people going that way, I can't count that against them though.,I am sure it will probably become a well oiled machine in the coming month or so.,The one and only complaint I have is the wait for a pizza! There is a warning on the menu saying that there is a 40-60 minute wait for the pizza because it's hand made. . . really, an hour!?,I love pizza and Uncle Bears, which is a 15 foot walk has equally as good of pizza when you consider that it's ready in 10 minutes.,That said everyone was very nice.","Yes! I'm officially addicted to this pizza.,Honestly, the only good New York style pizza in Madison.,I'm originally from New Jersey (yes, I am aware that is *not* New York) so I've missed a good thin crust. .,So far, the eggplant pizza is my favorite.,I mean, I've liked all the ones I had.,I think the ratio of the ingredients is good. .,I ordered a salad yesterday to pretend like I was being healthy in addition to the giant slice of pizza I was going to consume.,They give a good amount of salad! The feta in the Mediterranean salad is super yummy, though on the salty side. .,I went there again today, after ordering delivery yesterday.,I don't plan on going tomorrow, but we will see.","I like to bowl about once a year &amp; this fit the bill!  We went on a Thursday afternoon &amp; they had a special to bowl unlimited games with unlimited pizza for two hours for $14/pp.,We weren't hungry &amp; said no to the special until she told us the total ($70???) so we got the special &amp; just didn't have pizza.,The alley is nice &amp; they played an excellent mix of music with the videos on the big screens at the end of the alley (even a Jerry Lee Lewis video from the 50's!!!)  They even have a \"jukebox to choose music from.,The staff was pleasant &amp; very helpful &amp; even picked out the perfect ball for me before I even asked (they are behind the counter).,They have 1/2 sized shoes so we bowled away &amp; had a great time!  (I broke 100 twice &amp; my sweetie broke 150!)  The were several people/families bowling &amp; everyone was polite &amp; appropriately behaved (always a plus)","DO NOT RENT AN APARTMENT HERE.  Law students who really want litigation experience may want to consider it because this place screams \"sue me\" on a regular basis. . 1.,LIES, DAMN LIES - The employees will lie to you, without a doubt.,I have lost count of the number of times I have been lied to while living here.,We were lied to about the ability to get satellite TV installed, about the state of our apartment on moving in, about regularity of the bus (forget it when school is not in session), the safety of the place, and about so much more. . 2.,FEES WITHOUT SERVICES - The Village has no qualms about charging a fee for a service they do not provide.,We sublet initially and were told we would have to pay a redecoration fee and would have to leave at least two days between the prior tenant's move-out and our move-in so they could \"redecorate\".,When we arrived, of course, the place had not been cleaned let alone redecorated.,When we asked about this, we were told that they never redecorate in sublet situations.,You should not be surprised to hear that the sublessor was not refunded her redecoration fee and neither were we.,In addition, a number of friends were assessed charges for things they had not done, including fines for leaving trash out.,Very questionable behavior. . 3.,CRIME - Numerous cars had their back windows shot-out while I have been living here, at least three by my count.,The Village refused to do anything in response. . 4.,THERE ARE NO SOCCER FIELDS OR BASKETBALL COURTS BEHIND THE VILLAGE - When we signed up, we were shown a nice diagram of Colbert park with all of its facilities, including a soccer field, a basketball court, and an amphitheater.,These things do not exist.,There is some grass and a hill, but it takes some imagination to conjure up what the Village subtly advertises. .,If you're the kind of person who is willing to forgive all manner of misbehavior in exchange for a pool and pizza party every once in a while then by all means move in here. .,As a final note, both the Village drivers and maintenance staff are perfectly friendly and seem competent enough.,This review is limited to a critique of the management and office staff who ought to be ashamed of their behavior.","Vegan options in downtown Vegas!!! Pizza was super tasty and the service was pretty decent.,Half way through baking my pie they remembered that I only wanted mushrooms on half, so they took it out of the oven and picked them off.,Kind of weird, but whatever.,Nice gesture, but paws off my pizza! Lol.","Authentic Italian pizza made with fresh ingredients! Do yourself a favor and place an order tonight! Personally love the Quattro Formaggio pizza!","Great late night stop.,The building is gorgeous with the open industrial feel.,Late night they have pizza specials and an awesome DJ. I liked the lounge feel! The service was super slow and it took forever for drinks, but once we got them they were great.,Worth checking out!","After seeing Hash House A Go Go on a Food Network show, my hubby wanted to go for the famous chicken and waffles for Sunday brunch. .,We arrived around 10:40 and were immediately seated Ina large booth in the corner.,Our friendly server came over right away and took drinks orders while explaining a few particularly popular many items. .,Items chosen; chicken waffles (he loved it), apple-cinnamon pancake (yummy and seriously the size of a medium pizza!), kids hamburger (huge, said to be a little oily tasting), and egg white scramble with avocado and sweet potato fries (good). .,While the portions are easily large enough for 2 people to share, one will not be disappointed if comfort foods is your hankering.","Upper Crust is like Grimaldi's on steroids.,The two places have nearly identical decor and the pizza is extremely similar.,Upper Crust uses a little more cheese which is nice, but they also use cornmeal on the crust which I am not crazy about.,The wings are huge and delicious, especially with the honey BBQ sauce.,The meatballs are nothing special (with or without the mozzarella cheese), but Stephanie H would disagree.,Happy hour is Monday-Friday 4pm to 7pm and on Wednesdays they offer half off on bottles of wine. .,Overall, it is a very good pizza and I plan on returning.,Next time I'll be giving that pizza cookie a try.,I really liked Upper Crust, but Grimaldi's in Old Town is still my favorite for traditional NY style thin crust pizza.","I have to say that not only is the food amazing, the employees are extremely friendly.,They went as far to fulfill my request to draw John Snow from Game of Thrones (easily the best pizza place EVER!) Thank you so much!","Ordered today for lunch for delivery to my workplace.,My boss treated us to lunch since it was my birthday.,Ordered online and delivery was 6 minutes later than they said it would be but all the food was correct and delicious!  I got a large supreme pizza, lots of wings, and a cookie for under $50 bucks and it fed the whole office.,Delivery dude was nice.","I've been to Rudino's a couple times with coworkers.,It's a pretty solid lunch joint: the centerpiece is the pizza buffet, although both times I've gone, I've ordered salads.,Their salads are atypically good for an establishment like this: there's actually more to them than iceberg lettuce and ranch.,However, I am only giving Rudino's two stars because they are pricey (which, admittedly, is fairly typical for that part of town) and the service is on the slow side.","This place is hit or miss depending on who's working, and tonight was a miss.,Pizza Nova is by far the best chain pizza store, and they're usually pretty consistent, but this place is the worst one I've ever frequented.,The pizza tonight tasted almost like nothing.,Not sure why the couple who own the place refuse to put more than an ounce of sauce on the pizza, but that's what you basically get from them.,You dont even taste the sauce, that's how little they put.,The lack of sauce throws off the whole balance of what a pizza is, so all you taste is dough, cheese, and toppings.,It's more like a sandwich with no condiments than a pizza.,We didn't even bother finishing the whole thing, which is unheard of in our household, that's how bland it was.,If there was a better option in the area I wouldn't bother with this place, sadly there isn't.","New to the area and had a papa johns in so-cal I loved.,This place is decent if you want chain pizza at a good price.","This a great little neighborhood sports bar.,It's our go-to place for UFC events.,The place is clean &amp; comfortable, with a nice ambiance and we've always had good service (even on crazy fight nights when the placed is packed).,We have found the prices to be a little high for a sports bar style menu, but when you consider they don't charge a cover fee for UFC events &amp; sometimes have coupons, it's not too bad. .,The food isn't 5 star amazing, but it's pretty solid for a joint like this.,We've tried probably about half the stuff on the menu in the years we've been visiting Augie's.,For the appetizers, the egg-roll-wrapped mozz sticks &amp; pretzel sticks are the best of the bunch.,Their wings are run-of-the-mill &amp; sadly they don't offer variable heat levels on the buffalo style (it's a soft medium IMO).  The burgers &amp; sandwiches are mostly good, but not exceptional.,The best things on the menu are the ribs &amp; pizza.,The ribs are baked/grilled style rather than smoked, but they're super tender with a sweet sauce &amp; fall off the bone.,The pizza is probably our favorite thing at Augie's.,If fact, I'd even say I was kinda shocked at how good it was when we first tried it.,The crust is a bit bready, but it really works with the sauce &amp; cheese they use.,It's definitely worth a try.,Pro tip - order it \"well done\" to get a nice slightly charred edge.,For dessert, the chocolate brownie sundae thing is surprisingly awesome.,It's simple, but good &amp; surely plentiful. .,All in all, we're lucky to have a joint like this out in the far west valley.,They have friendly service, show UFC fights for free, and the food is above-average for this kind of place.","I ordered dinner using the Just Eat app, where they have free delivery for orders over $20. .,I ordered the Veggie spring rolls, honey garlic chicken, and pineapple chicken fried rice.,It was decent - the honey garlic chicken was a bit sweeter than I was expecting and too much breading but still tasted okay.,The rice was my favourite - lots of pineapple and fair amount of chicken.,I'll probably order food here again, but not the honey garlic chicken. .,Delivery was quick and the food was hot and fresh when it arrived.,The driver was very friendly and I tipped him on the Just Eat app when I paid on there.,It made the transaction very simple - as soon as he arrived with my food, I didn't have to try and hold everything while paying on a mobile machine at the front door like when you order pizza.","Visited here on Sunday.,It is very simple, breakfast with little pizzazz.,It was very unflavorful.,I ordered Eggs scrambled, Sausage Links, and \"Cheese Grits\". (Cheese Grits to them means a sliver of fake American cheese is a type of processed cheese -- you know the type from the cellophane wrapper)  -- placed on top.,YUCK.  Hands down one of the biggest disappointments for a breakfast place in Charlotte.,Especially near Stonecrest.,Parking is awful (near Trader Joe's).,Staff was friendly but I would Pass this one up with all the better options in the area . . . . . . . .","TLDR: Great spot for a slice of late night pizza on De la Montagne just under St. Catherine. .,Pizza Chez Danny makes tasty pizza that will squash your late night craving.,The crust is thin and crisp on the bottom, but soft on top.,The addition of sesame seeds on the top adds a delicious nuttiness to every bite of the sweet crust.,The mixed cheese of the simple cheese pizza melts into yummy goodness and sits on a light dose of tomato sauce.,With tax, the slice came out to around $3, and it was delicious.,I definitely recommend this place for your Americanized pizza itch.","Came here after soaking up the sun in the Aria where we were staying in las vegas.,We were going for a later meal, wanted something casual that wasn't a buffet and one of the casino employees mentioned this place had good pizza so the other non-New Yorkers were lured in (as someone who has had fantastic pizza here in NYC and Chicago I was skeptical). .,We were promptly seated (for a party of 8 we had our own private dining area), and our waitress was very prompt and attentive to our table.,They have a small menu, but it catered to our different dietary restrictions (some were doing a Paeleo diet, some were doing low carb, some were vegetarian. . . it's hard to please 8 women sometimes!). .,I ended up getting the sausage and peppers sandwich, the well suited, and a few of us tried the margharetia pizza .,The drink was nice and strong, and was the best part of my meal.,The sausage and peppers sandwich was flavorful, though the amount of bread was overwhelming to the amount of sausage and pepers within the sandwich so it was mostly bread.,The pizza, though we requested it be cut in 8 (usually their pies are cut in 6), was cut oddly so it wasn't an equitable division of pizza amongst our party (so we ended up cutting some slices in half), however the taste was bland and the crust though well done on the edges, could have been cooked a bit more and tasted a bit raw. .,So for a quick casual bite I would say ok, however this wouldn't rank very highly in my list of places to eat while in Vegas.","Before you eat here you have to know that this restaurant has been around for 37 YEARS! That is amazing for any restaurant.,Restaurants come and go, but this one has stood the test of time. . . and you\"ll definitely notice that the decor, although clean and super comfortable, is understatedly retro. .,I liked the vibe here.,There's a fair sized restaurant area and a large lounge with a cozy brick fireplace.,It's usually packed Friday and Saturday nights. .,The owner's son played with the Calgary Stampeders once upon a time, so there's lots of Stampeder memorabilia.,It wouldn't be completely unrealistic to see some football players digging into some steaks while you're eating. .,My friends and I had pizza, Greek salad and Caesar salad.,The Greek Salad was delicious and had some bonus creaminess to it.,The Caesar (large) was nice and garlicky and came with a generous side of garlic toast. .,We had the Ambrosia pizza (think spinach, artichoke hearts  feta) and the Athenian pizza (think feta and olives).,Both had toppings that blended together in the most amazing way! I would order both again. .,Service was great - attentive, polite and friendly. .,This restaurant has a solid menu; is comfortable and laid back; and has some friendly employees who obviously enjoy what they do.","We came here before a concert at Consol Center.,It's across the street, it was very packed, so leave yourself a lot of time to get a table if you want to eat here.,We got lucky &amp; got a table only hour before the concert!! We ordered a pizza &amp; it was good for a bar.,Good selection of beers!!","Four stars because this place is an institution.,Not just fries, but a BAG of fries.,Be prepared to share with everyone you know and even someone you don't know.,The pizzas also aren't bad, especially for the price, but late at night, be prepared to wait awhile while all the other drunken patrons are getting their own food.  .,Oh, the store is not the best place to actually eat you food, but just take it home and start that second party.","My favourite Superstore in the city, and clearly, the only one I go to. .,The reason I love this particular location so much is because it's in a good area (Edgemont), the crowd isn't sketchy (like I sometimes find it to be in the other locations of Superstore) and depending on which day you go, it's not always insanely packed.,I also love that they always carry every single last item on my grocery list, including the items on my 'Indian shopping list' such as basmati rice and chickpea flour.,The produce section is always well stocked and it's rare that they run out of items before restocking them.,The prices are always reasonable and they carry Joe Fresh clothing which I love to peruse!.,The parking situation is also good and it's located in the Country Hills Plaza so you can pick up movie rentals, drop off your dry cleaning, pick up some pizza and even grab a couple of blizzards from Dairy Queen on your way home :).,I've missed this Superstore in my years away and I'm planning to make up for lost time in the upcoming weeks :) .,See you there.","I have no idea of the history of this place, but it has one.,They also use the same sourdough starter for the pizzas for about 50 years.,The waitress explained this too me, but all i know is the pizza turned out pretty good.,Our version had giant pieces of pepperoni, a dabble of grilled jalapeno and purple onion.,This not really NY style as I was barely able to fold the thing, but it was all about that sourdough crust.,In a surprise though, the pizza did not taste good reheated.,Another surprise was the \"check in\" on facebook and get an order of chicken tenders for $2.,These were small, hot and crunchy little tenders which were quite good.,They have an upstairs with games and of course all the funky stuff is fun to check out.,Half the patio is covered also, so that is a good thing.","Large gambling spa resort.,Many restaurants, poker room, meeting rooms, pools and 2 wings of hotel rooms.,Nice views from almost every room.,They also have a tub and shower in their standard rooms.,Good light blockout curtains.,Outdoor pool. .,What makes this place extra fun is that you can walk out of the casino and go to an outdoor shopping mall with restaurants, retail and hobby stores.,There is actually fun restaurants here and interesting retail stores from jewelry, clothes, to hiking wares.,Most bars/restaurants feature gambling and great beer/alcohol features. .,Can walk even farther to a Whole foods and pizza place.,Lots of stuff.","We love Black Rock!!! This is THE best place to get pizza!! We became fans when they were over on Race St. Now that they have more room it's even better!!! They also have live music, real pinball tables, and support local charities.,My kind of place!!!!!","Trying out a new Greek place today and so happy I did! Went to Hummus for lunch.,This is a great concept I like.,Blaze pizza did it and so does Hummus.,A Chipotle style built your own bowl or wrap.,Lots of great options! I went with the bowl today and I loved it! Delicious and the healthiest thing I've had in days, just a real feel good meal.,I thought having hummus on the bottom would be weird, but I worked great.,The lamb was wonderful and I love the whole scoop of feta.,Will definitely be back especially since it's so close to my place in Anthem.","Called in and was put on hold for more than 5 minutes.,Once I placed my order I was told pickup would be between 6:30 and 6:50. . . . it's 4:30! 2 hours for a couple of thin crust pizzas?,Why a twenty minute range for pickup?,I cancelled order so never got to taste the food.,Good news is that the reviews are bad, so it'll slow down enough for me to give it a try very soon. .,FYI - your rating on Yelp is the same as Peter Piper Pizza.,Hilarious!","If you like thin greasy pizza, then Alexander's Pizza is good for you.,The $6 large pizza is a nice deal, and I do admit the flavor is marginally better than Caesar's $5 pizza.,The only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking WET from being drenched in oil. .,Alexander's pizza also serves Italian and Greek entree meals.,The pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! It's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads.,Their ranch dressing really is superb and the family that runs this place seem very nice.,Not the friendliest bunch of people, but you can tell their honest and work hard.","A lazy Sunday precluded me from making dinner so Pizza Pit Extreme was the next best option.,The take-out spot (there are a few tables if you wanted to eat onsite) is a strange one.,It is an amalgamation of three former separate restaurants-Pizza Pit, Pizza Extreme and Athen's gryo.,This makes it a bit challenging ordering online as there are options for that refer to either Pizza Pit or Pizza Extreme but no explanation on what makes them different (case in point, what is Pizza Pit sauce vs Extreme sauce?). .,The menu is pretty extensive (always a concern for me) so I stuck to a pepperoni and sausage pizza.,With a coupon, the price was right for what we got.,The toppings were pretty standard and not much different that ones found on a store bought pizza.,It was definitely greasy. .,In a pinch or on a hungover day, I would come back due to how close by it is for me.,I wouldn't, however, hold it as a gold or even silver standard for what a pizza should be.","Haven't been to pizza hut in a few yrs.,My daughter and I wanted to try the bacon crust pizza one day a few wks ago so I ordered online  (ok that wasn't successful so I had to call) anyway I placed my order and 5 mins later they called and said they ran out of the bacon crust.,This was at noon.,Wasn't very happy.,Needless to say I don't think I'll be attempting this again any time soon","I wasn't planning on commenting on quality of food, but since other's have been experiencing the same issues. . . .,We were very excited to move into Sun Prairie where there was a Glass Nickel Pizza nearby (we previously lived in the Milwaukee area).,The day after we moved in, we decided to order Glass Nickel to eat while unpacking.,The staff was fairly friendly on the phone, pizza came in the delivery estimate time.,Pizza itself was okay, but not NEARLY as good as the New Berlin and West Madison locations. .,The next day, we became violently ill.,With the chaos of moving, their pizza was the only thing I ate all day so I'm sure that it was from this.,My husband and I are positive we got food poisoning from their pizza.,We do not plan on re-visiting the Sun Prairie Glass Nickel Pizza (especially after the reviewer stated that employees were cleaning toilets sans washing hands).,Such a shame!!","We have ordered and enjoyed: buffalo chicken salad, steak salad, Caesar salad, tossed salad with cheese, spinach rolls, eggplant parmesan hoagie, the Napoleon pizza, and pizza with and without toppings.,As others have mentioned, the cheesey breadsticks are great.,I'm vegetarian and I love their eggplant parm, especially on the Napoleon pizza. .,We get delivery in Fineview in 45 minutes or less.,I've ordered online, through Eat24 and GrubHub.,I prefer Eat24 and their weekly $2 coupon, as well as their Pizza &amp; Sticks deal for $16. 99 (large cheese pizza, breadsticks &amp; mozzarella sticks [toppings extra]. ).,I believe the horrible driver people have mentioned no longer works there.,We've been ordering delivery on monthly basis from Riviera Pizza for over two years and have had a problem only once.","Not bad for a chain.,I think with Il Piazzaiolo and Mercurio's there's really no competition, but for a quick bite in Settlers Ridge, it was a-okay!.,I ordered the roasted cauliflower pizza.,The cauli was roasted to a crisp and I really liked the Parmesan cheese on top.,An individual size pizza was plenty for a lunch portion too. .,I also ordered a Bloody Mary since it was on special (I can't help myself).,It wasn't horrible, but kinda boring. .,The service was incredibly friendly.,I just wish they weren't blasting the AC, as I was felt like I needed a parka to eat inside in August.,I'll take my pizza parka free, thanks!","Fantastic restaurant to go to for a classy romantic or family oriented dinner.,The food itself is based around the concept of everything local everything fresh.,I ordered the polenta fries, which are to die for, and a pizza, which was very authentic in terms of the way it was prepared.,The service is phenomenal and the owner was very friendly.,If you get a chance to go to this place don't hesitate.","Okay. . . another check in.,There is no doubt this is one of my \"go to\" places to eat and I will continue to go back!

This isn't your typical sardine-packed Dundas bar and you are not going to have to grind through a sea of people to get a drink.,Sorry annonymous gropers, it's back to Red Light for you.,You may have to wait to get a table but there is ample room in the back, and a second bar, so you don't need to lurk over peoples tables while they eat.,Better still, pump some quarters in to the pinball machines while you wait. .,They few shows I have seen the acoustics have been OK. It's a large concrete box so you have to work with what you got, and they do a decent job.,You will see the sound guy moving about the room checking levels.,Gotta appreciate the effort. .,Pretty well rounded beer selection and the few small dishes I have ordered were pretty tasty, arrived promptly to the correct table (WHAAAAT), and were well priced.,Most notable were the double w/ pork belly &amp; Blue Mac &amp; Cheese.,I've read alot of complaints about the service, and personally can't speak to that.,My experiences have always been pleasant.,Sadly, It's not your servers fault it's January outside. .,If the menu doesn't tickle your fancy there's a pizzeria down the road called Little Caesers that does a pretzel crust pizza. :-o.,The future is NOW.","Came for a weekend skate with my girlfriend and her little sister.,Employees were all very nice, and courteous.,Interior design was a bit lacking, as building is pretty dated and little to no effort was made to cover up the cinderblock construction.,Seemed very 80s or 90s but not really in a good way.,Food prices were good, but food itself was lackluster.,I wanted a slice of pizza that was advertised on the menu and was told slices were not available and I'd have to buy a whole pizza that would take about 30 minutes to bake.,Settled for a hot dog and watched as the stale bun crumbled apart after the first bite, but I guess I shouldn't expect a whole lot when it was $2.","I stayed here for 5 days so here's the breakdown. . .,PROS:. I got a 600 sq ft. suite on the 32nd floor with a fat ass balcony, strip view,  2 42\" plasmas, TV in the bathroom, bomb ass shower with a rain nozzle on the ceiling, jacuzzi tub with jets and speakers, fridge, and one helluva comfortable ass bed. .,This was easily the nicest room with best view of the strip I have ever been in.,You can see the whole strip because this hotel is on the other side of the 15.,From Mandalay Bay all the way down to the Stratosphere, you can see everything. .,Paid 120 a night for this place.,This room is easily worth 3 times that. .,Staff was on point with luggage and valet. . 24 hour room service. .,Ipod dock with speakers. .,Bunch of kitchen utensils, stove, stocked mini fridge (don't even think about pulling anything out of there I can only imagine a jack daniels shooter is like 12 bucks).,Button you can flip on permanently that lights up the do no disturb sign outside your room. .,Safe and 2 closets. .,Comfortable couch. .,Free USA today paper. .,Self parking was literally a 100 foot walk to my car every time. .,Did I mention it came out to 120 a night? .,All in all I was real happy with the whole experience. .,CONS:. At check in I found out I needed to have a 500 dollar authorization put a credit card (100 for each night).,I wasn't told this at anytime by palms or the site I booked through.,The front desk guy did it for 300 cash but that was money I planned on spending on coke and hookers. .,No phone book in the room (personal pet peeve).,No ice machine on each floor (brought to you by room service one tiny ass bucket at a time. .,Internet costs 13 bucks a day. .,Long distance phone calls cost (get this) 5. 00 for the first minute, 79 cents for each additional. (I found this out after I made 2 calls).,Fridge could have been bigger. .,Room service costs an absolute fortune and there was some crazy 10 dollar mark up on my bill so with tip, 2 small pizzas cost me like 50 bucks. .,Early check out?,Doesn't exist on a Friday. . 200 dollar charge if you smoke in the room. . 300 dollar charge if you don't check out on time. .,Check out is 11am (brutal when you were at the strip club till 3:30 am).,All in all I was amazed with the room and the view.,Might be the nicest place I ever stay at but the list of cons brought it down a star for me. .,The website you want to check for the best deals is www. tripres. com.","Pizza, pizza, pizza.,Love it.,Nello's is a good laid back place to get together with some family and/or friends and have lots of options for pizza and sald, and knock a few back.,Service is about 4 stars too.","Had lunch with my wife here.,She's Colombian and felt it had some traditional Colombian flavors with more modern simple dishes.,I mention the Colombian part as there are really no restaurants close by with rice, beans, sweet plantains, empanadas, and steak.,Was very good quick and attentive service.,For $5. 99 she got the dinner portion with soup.,I tried the grilled chicken over salad with avocados beans and corn was delicious and will definitely go here again.,One of the reviews picked up food for take out and I understand his feelings as haven eaten many Colombian meals prepared by her Mom, her aunts, many places in Florida, Puerto Rico and in Dominican Republic this food is just best eaten right away.,Try it out, for the area it's great to have another option other than BBQ, Chinese, or pizza.","Came here on the 29th of March for the Lucky Gnocchi Night, which is basically all-you-can eat gnocchi in a variety of sauces. .,There are specific seating times for this event - not sure of all of the times, but the dinnertime options were 5 or 7 p. m. .,The gnocchi overall was decent, it was kind of hit or miss with some batches overcooked, or too cold, or just right.,Our faves of the night were the bolognese, four cheese, and Pompeii (basic, crushed tomato sauce).,The pesto one was quite good as well, but the butter sage was flavourless.,Service was frequent, but they ran out of some flavours and returned with second rounds of previous flavours instead which I was kind of disappointed in. .,I probably won't return for the gnocchi event now that I've tried it, but may go back to try out their pizzas and other dishes.","I came here for lunch sometime when I krave for some good pizza. . . .,The price is fantastic and the pizza is pretty good. . . .,It's not on top of my list but it serves its purpose for a quick lunch. . . .,People are mostly buy it togo. . . there are limited table to dine in. . . .,It made to QG approved list only if i'm around the area. . . not really driving across town just for it!","Peter Piper is Arizona's family oriented pizza chain.,Most people think the pizza is complete garbage and often describe it as cardboard, but I think it's just plain great.","I used to work as a waitress at this restaurant's original incarnation (Amelio's est. 1985) in 2003 when I was at university so I can you that not only is the food DELICIOUS, this is a lovely family restaurant that treats its staff very well. .,I thought they'd closed down so I was ecstatic when my boyfriend found out they reopened as Amelia's with the daughter at the helm, how wonderful to see this awesome family business continue past its 30th year! I love supporting local companies and this is the real deal. .,Now on to the food! There's a reason that every crop of McGill students learns of Amelia's and quickly sees it as a staple.,Not only are the prices reasonable, it's BYO and group-friendly for before a big night out.,It was not uncommon when I worked there for groups of 8 to show up with a couple of boxes of wine and have a great time before hitting the night life.,Now I happen to prefer a better quality to drink myself, but love that this joint is casual enough to cater to that crowd and nice enough to suit my needs as a young professional as well. .,The white pizza (5-cheese) is a MUST. I highly recommend sharing one small, medium or large with your table as it's a little intense to eat alone but absolutely TO DIE FOR. You must try it as nature intended, but a great hack from my waitressing days is to ask them to add tomato slices &amp; garlic for even more flavour.,Just adding mushrooms is another fav. .,The Florentine pizza with artichoke hearts and spinach is also amazing, and often gets overshadowed by the white but very subtle and delicious flavors.,Only available as a small, so bear that in mind! The vegetarian is delicious and has a sauce base that includes eggplant.,The Reuben pizza is basically a smoked meat sandwich in a pizza, complete with sauerkraut and mustard on the side - definitely not for the faint of heart but we'll worth it if you love meat and want the adventure.,If you're a first-timer I'd definitely suggest splitting that with a more standard pizza,  though.,Or the White :).,You really can't go wrong with the pizzas, and any small can be done in whole wheat dough which is great if you wanna be a bit healthier.,They aren't intended to be Italian-style thin crust pizzas so do be aware of that.,The crust is fluffy, buttery, almost pastry-like (I believe they use Crisco shortening in the dough) so expect more of a New York style slice.,I almost never eat crusts from pizzas but I always finish theirs, they're so good!! .,The little salads that come with each order are lovely and give you that valuable extra greenery before say, eating 5 melted cheese on dough!! And their subs and pastas are great too, but the pizzas really do shine here. .,If you get dessert, the cheesecake was always my favourite, and all desserts are made in-house. .,Note that it's cash only, so come prepared! One of my fav things to do is get dinner here before catching a rep film at Cinema Du Parc.,They stop taking customers at 9 (but you can be seated until 9 and stay until 10) so plan accordingly. .,You will have an awesome meal, promise :)","Pop Up Pizza was conveniently located next to the elevator going to my room, so of course I had to try it.,If you're staying at Plaza, look out for their coupon too! My welcome booklet came with a deal on two slices of cheese and a drink, but I just asked if I could pay a little extra for toppings. .,The storefront is cool looking and they were playing a lot of dubstep. . . probably because it was EDC week.,The workers there were friendly, and even though there is no soda fountain outside, you can still get free refills of your drink by asking. .,I got a slice of their White Chapel pizza (ricotta and spinach) as well as a generic meat lovers.,The White Chapel is sooo goooood! The other one was tasty too, but I preferred the White Chapel despite the lack of meat.,The slices are pretty big, and I really liked the crisp yet chewy crust.,Dare I say I liked it better than Secret Pizza, a Vegas joint on the strip that also has NY style pizza?,What they have on this place is location, but Pop Up Pizza is cheaper, faster, and equally (if not more) delicious. .,Food: 4, Service: 4, Environment: 4, Price: 3","This pizza has a good amount of sauce, and it is very flavorful, giving it a homemade feeling.,The crust is delicious, too.,We mostly order the pizza and cheese bread.,I'm not crazy about this style of garlic bread they make, as it hardens quickly, but their cheese bread is phenomenal and somehow tastes even better as leftovers.","Sadly, as I am a huge Arcadia Nook fan, I cannot give this location the 5 star rating I was totally expecting to give.,I am in love with the Wood Fired Olives appetizer here, we ordered that and it was totally on par with the Arcadia location.,My family ordered two pizza's the Giardino and the Margherita and said it was also on par with Arcadia and they looked great.    .,My order was the Cowboy Rib Eye.,I typically bounce back and forth between the Chicken Marsala and the Filet, and I tell everyone the Filet at Nook Arcadia is the best $27 filet you will ever eat.,They don't offer the Filet here so I went with their new Ribeye which is $34 and served over smashed Yukon Gold potatoes with four asparagus spears on the side.  .,Presentation and plating was beautiful. . .,My mouth was watering. . .,The ribeye was bone-in BUT it was full of fat and gristle, it was edible but I spent most of the time trying to cut around the gristle or pulling it out of my mouth.,I don't mind fat in my steak I just prefer more to steak to fat, and not the tough gristle this steak had throughout.,The potatoes which were advertised as garlic parmesan were also bland and seem to be lack both garlic and parmesan.,The asparagus was good.,This is not anything like the preparation or quality of the Filet at Arcadia and it was a 2 star dish for me for sure on the steak quality alone.,I typically want to lick my plate at Nook but this wasn't the case the plate left the table with half a steak, lots of fat pieces and almost all the potatoes.  .,This location charges more for the same dishes, understandably they are in the hotel, it is bigger and they likely have more expenses, however I was a little surprised to see the same Chicken Marsala offered at Arcadia was $5 more here.  .,The valet parking is also expensive, $17 normally, $12 if you eat at the restaurant and get a stamp.,Find a parking spot if you can and don't valet, this isn't Nook's fault, just a tip. .,If it weren't for the olives and pizza this would sadly be a 2 star review for me.,Service was good.","The food is excellent and the bread is the best in Urbana.,Dinner is delightful with excellent gourmet pizzas, fondu, tapas, etc.,On Sunday, they have an excellent and low priced brunch.,The dinner prices are reasonable for the quality of the food.,Their sangria is also the best I've ever tasted.,The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is the service which at times is very slow.","I wonder if Hannibal Lecter eats here?.,Lamb brains, anyone?.,Sensing my curiosity, the charming waiter talked me into it by saying that it was \"just a tiny bite\". .,Well, a tiny bite it wasn't.,In fact, two egg-roll sized, bacon-wrapped \"lamb brains\" showed up, with a side of (I think) pesto sauce.  .,It tasted like. . . monk fish liver.  .,If you don't think about what you're eating. . . it's not off-putting at all.,I'm glad I tried it. . . and it's now at the top of the \"the weirdest things I've eaten\" list, replacing kangaroo meat pizza (those Australians weren't kidding). .,Anyway - aside from that, I'd highly recommend the pig ears - a bit addicting, though too salty for my taste. .,I'd skip the pig blood spaghetti - chewy, but no sense in paying $22 for pure shock value in food. .,As for wine, if you like full bodied reds without tannins, try the 2011 Montalbera Ruch\u00e8 di Castagnole Monferrato L'Accento.,Smooth!","Glad to hear that this location is just steps from the office and is perfect when wanting to catch up with coworkers after a long hard day. .,Their second location being relatively new, is a great addition to the financial district.,Serving up some great craft and seasonal beers it's perfect for those beer experts who truly appreciate locally brewed draft.  .,Their menu is full of popular pub fares that have no shortage of small portions.  .,The ambiance can get loud depending if you're upstairs or downstairs and at what time of the day.  .,Though I am more of a wine drinker I did give their Blonde and Amber beer a try which was crispy, light and refreshing. .,In terms of food our small group tried their Flammekueches (hard to pronounce) which was a flatbread pizza served with cheese, black olives, cheese and ham.,This definitely complimented our beers, however the next time I'll be sure to try some of their pub grubs to get a better sense of the menu. .,Food 3/5.,Service 3/5.,Cleanliness 4/5","First time tonight.,Staff super friendly, service great, and pizza was fantastic!  We've found a new hangout!  Can't wait to try something else for dinner.","Did the online order.,Arrive at the time that the food was supposed to be ready. 10 minutes after I'm told it will be a little longer, I'm told that the wings are going to be another 12 minutes!!!  WTF?!?,So now I'm sitting here in the store for about 30 additional minutes!  I wouldn't have ordered if I knew it was gonna be this long for one pizza and a few wings.,Nobody wants to sit in your shack for 30 minutes when you've already been told that the food will be ready when you arrive. the question I have now is how cold is the pizza gonna be when I get home.,I want a nice fresh, hot pizza.,Not something that's been sitting for 30 f-ing minutes!!!","I really enjoyed this place on my recent visit to the Aria Casino.,It's located near the sports book, which was a plus for me.,The pizza was great and they had a nice selection of local craft beer, which was nice since I was visiting from out of town. . 5 Stars all the way!","Because everyone has to come here once for their roast duck poutine pizza. .,Unfortunately, the pizza was just alright.,Sure we all love a thin crust pizza with cheese curds falling off, but the combination of everything comprising the topping was a little overwhelming.,I ended up eating the fries separately for the slices that I had, and I barely tasted the duck pieces because of how many other ingredients were on the pizza.,It's like one of those school projects where the idea is nice, execution could even be effortless, but final result, underwhelming. .,Miheer's Curried Lamb Shoulder- Didn't see the curry in the description and expected a chunk of lamb shoulder. . what a flavourful dish though!  It was a very creamy curry with a hint of spice, the lamb was well-cooked and I LOVED the garlic roti that the curry came with.,It was a bit oily but I loved how chewy the roti was and balanced the curry nicely.,Almost wished we didn't have the pizza to start so that I could enjoy more of this dish, definitely a fan. .,Service was good, decor is worth a look. .,O&amp;B does it well :)","We ordered pizza.,It was pretty tasty.,But the service was very slow.,For the prices, I expect a refill of a soft drink without being asked (and I wasn't asked until just before the check arrived).,In the end, I felt it was a little overpriced for what we got.,Maybe that's how everything is downtown, but I could take it or leave.","I've had bad experiences at other Pizza Hut shops, but this one always gives me well made pizzas.,Pizza is always fresh, never burnt, always done by the time I get there.,There's always people in there so I'm assuming they feel the same way.,Try the stuffed crust and crust toppers.","So walking in it was a little confusing if this was a order first type place or a sit down restaurant with someone waiting on you.,We were the o my ones in the restaurant so that's not a good sign, but this place is right next to ASU and school is out.,The menu was pretty basic and nothing really stood out to me but i ordered the REVO pizza.,I do have to say I like way this place looks.,It's very urban with giant glass windows and a great center bar with four flat screen TVs. .,The pizza was good but wasn't amazing and the Caesar salad was very basic.,I wouldn't mind go back and giving it one more try for dinner but I will be trying something else.","We found this place from the awesome Yelp! Reviews.,It did not disappoint!! From my husband's fried mozzarella to my gluten free spinach artichoke dip, then on to the fabulous gluten free pizza, we left stuffed.,We were celebrating our honeymoon in the area and through conversation they found out and gave us an appetizer on the house! If we lived here this would be a go to spot for us! Thank you NYPD! You made us feel so special and full!","The naan at this place is fantastic because it's perfect for dipping and absorbing sauces.,My uneducated guess is that they remove many air bubbles before baking using a docker (a spiked roller often used on pizzas to remove air bubbles that would otherwise expand.,Each piece of na'an is also thicker.,We ordered a second helping of na'an for the 3 of us just to finish up the rest of our dishes. .,The chicken jalfrezi was oily, but it was good and the chicken was tender.,The butter chicken looked better.,Choosing is very difficult because of the many options they have. .,Next time we'll try the daily specials written on the chalkboard on the wall behind the register.,Totally missed that.,Service was unremarkable. .,Wifi password is fishtikah","great newyork style pizza, crust and dough is really good. lunch with the slice and salad and drink is so bomb for like 4 bucks, maybe the cheapest lunch in town and it good, not just something you eat cause its cheap, you will want to go back again! wings are good and so are the fried mushroom and zucchini sticks.","Very mediocre pizza.,If you're stranded in the Brothers parking lot with a broken down car and you're really hungry, you'd be better off walking to the Circle K and getting a snack to tide you over til help arrives.,To everyone who gave it lots of stars, you need to get out more and live a little. . . and eat better pizza.","This place is kind of a hidden gem at The Venetian.,I would never have thought to give this place a try had it not been for the thick \"Yellow Pages\" type book in the hotel room (where it was listed) and for Yelp.,My friend and I came here around 5:30 on a Saturday and were, luckily, seated right away (I don't believe they take reservations).,It is a small restaurant, but quaint.,I love that the waiters spoke Italian; it made it more authentic to me.,Also, our waiter was funny and really nice. .,As for the food, it's yummy.,The portions are big and you won't hurt your wallet eating here.,Thank you to whoever suggested the meatballs.,I think they are, by far, the best I've ever had.,They were full of flavor and super moist.,The garlic rolls were delicious as well.,I was torn between the Penne in Vodka Sauce and Linguine Carbonara and the waiter suggested the latter.,I am definitely glad he steered me that way because it was really good.,If I had more room in my stomach I would've devoured the last three or four bites.,My friend had the pepperoni pizza (I can't remember what it was listed under on the menu) and that was good as well (super big portions, it's like ordering a medium from Pizza Hut).,The tiramisu was a perfect ending to the meal.,I'd love to come here again and try their other dishes.","Great place to hang out with your friends.,Although I was going to take another star off for the hefty price tag (around $45/p), the friendly staff made up for it. .,When you enter, you will be required to fill a waiver on an ipad.,Then you will be guided to a laneway with a staff member who goes over the rules with your group.,Everyone then gets a few tries at throwing the axe.,Bullseye is 5pts, inside the red is 3pts and blue is 1pt. . . etc.,When the instructional time is over, your group will get to play against each other in a round robin game.,Basically, the players with the highest points goes into finals. .,Axe throwing may sound intimidating, but it gets much easier as you go.,The staff is great in helping each person along the way.,I also like how they let you bring outside food and beer.,Our group was able to order pizza delivery while we were playing.,Overall, you should try this if you have not tried this latest trend in summer activities! :D","Normally we love Papa John's, but they don't deliver to our place.,We really wanted pizza so ordered carryout from what we thought was the Middleton store.,Our mistake we ordered from here.,That's ok.,It was our mistake. .,However, this store is insanely hard to find and get to and there is zero parking outside for carryout.,We ordered online from another store and the order stated it would be ready in 45 minutes.,It gave us a time.,It actually took longer than 45 minutes to weave through the square and finally park illegally in an alley behind the store while the husband went to get said pizzas.,They were just putting them in the oven.,So we had to wait another twenty minutes and staff wasn't apologetic, just rude stating that the pick up time is an estimate. .,The pizza was fine.,It was fresh and stayed warm on an eighty degree day until we were home to eat it.,But. . . . it's not worth the trip and while I gave no real issues with it taking an hour plus to be ready for carryout during a busy time of day  that should be acknowledged ahead of time.","Just flew into Phoenix after traveling over 24 hours - drove straight to our amazing rental house in chandler - found this Fantastic pizza place that delivers here on Yelp!

Highly recommend.","If you have never been here, they will bring you a free sample of their wings.,Great salad and great service.,Highly recommend the eggplant pizza.,The dough is made fresh! The salad pizza looks good, although I haven't tried it.","Good service, and $5 for a large NY style slice of pizza and beer is a pretty damn good deal.,Note: that happy hour deal is only for 2 or 3 of the beers on draft.","Pretty average spot. .,Italian food priced reasonably but won't really 'wow' you.,I had a sausage pizza for 11$ which was a good size and cooked somewhere in between thin crust and doughy.,They've got some lunch specials and salads that looked alright, although the salmon filet looked to be a frozen cut. .,Service was adequate. .,Is Baldwin street actually good?","Great pizza!! This place was a great last minute pick!! .,We decided to bring in the big 2013 with a small get together celebration at this pizza joint!! The service was great!!

Just yummy!","FINALLY made a visit to Lucille this past weekend and I can't wait to go back!  I'd heard mixed reviews on the pizza but honestly that's crazy!  That being said everything pales in comparison to their nachos. . . seriously. . . they are the best nachos I've ever had!  Their drinks are out of this world (which was expected since they're a Merchant step-sister) and the lounge in the basement is a MUST for after dinner socializing (tip: order the Mexican Firing Squad)!

I had not been there in a while, but I was on my way home and decided to stop for take-out.,I ordered a house salad with chicken.,The large portion easily fed two, the chicken was moist and well seasoned, and the house salad dressing is a Thousand Island-y sort of thing that is really good.,I'll have to get back soon to re-try the pizza. .,It is good to see places that maintain their quality standards over time.","Awesome, well-priced pizza.,Tasty, cheap snacks (arancini).,Beautiful space - the decor is phenomenal for a counter-service place.,Much higher-end all around (quality of food, quality of ambience) than you'd expect for the price point - even the napkins were high-class!

(4) kinds of sauces. (4) kinds of cheeses, which you can combine together. (7) kinds of meats. (7) kinds of veggies. (7) kinds of toppers, added after the pizza is cooked.,Who else sells you a (potentially) 25-topping pizza for $8. 95?!

The duck was moist and the pizza was drizzled with a tangy barbeque sauce that worked to bring immense flavor to the dish.,I am excited to return to try more of their food. .,The unique thing about taking their beer to go: they put it in a sealed can instead of a growler.,Very convenient if you need to travel with your beer.","When you have three kids under 10 and a 4 month old (Aunt duty), cooking dinner is the last thing on your mind.,At least for the inexperienced over here lol. .,I wanted to try something new, so I found the closest NY pizza place to my house.,Ordered two large pizzas with garlic balls (12) and was happy with the order.,The pizza was made perfect.,My only complaint is that I had to wait even when I arrived over thirty minutes past the time given for the food to be ready.","Second time here. . . .,Should have written a review from my first visit several years ago, it would have been better. .,We liked it so much the first time that we planned on eating there when we went down to Boulder City. .,We stopped in at dinner time and only a few people were seated outside. .,We ordered an antipasto salad, spaghetti &amp; meatballs and a small cheese pizza. .,The salad came out first, it was some cold cuts and cheese sliced in strips on top of iceberg lettuce that had seen better days, tomatoes were mushy from being cut early that morning, lots of ripe olives, banana peppers and oregano.,Not too appealing to the eye and I've had better.,Silverware would also be nice instead of plastic forks, if you're paying almost 9 bucks for a salad, it would be better not to eat with plastic.,The spaghetti came with one meatball.,The meatball was very flavorful, wish there was more. .,The sauce was also very flavorful and thick. .,The pizza, although again not eye appealing the crust with the sauce did have great flavor. .,If you like tomatoes, you're going to like the sauce.,The cheese kept sliding off but it was good &amp; chewy. .,Eating outside was nice, no atmosphere inside, and appeared that it needs a good cleaning. . .","Had their pizza, that was awesome.,It was one loaded up with stuff that I can't remember, but it was fab. .,Went back tonight and was a tad disappointed in what came with the gyro platter.,Some good places that I've been to put a little medley of things, which it had but was just olives, and those green things that end in cini.,There's a place in Seattle that I have yet to find which compares.,These guys put rice, hummus, feta, olives, tzatziki, and a small greek salad on the side which you can make an awesome wrap with!  And there was more portion for the same price.,The meat was good, and everything was good, but I won't order that again.,Seattle's ruined me.,If you are ever in Seattle, you must go to Mr. Gyro's.,I will confidently say that you will not find anyone who makes them better, if so, you got damn lucky!","Kicker's Pizza is a Brook Park treasure!! The wings are amazing and the chicken philly is quite possibly the perfect sandwich.,The homemade blue cheese should be sold in stores, too.,The pizza is made from scratch - no frozen crusts or canned sauce.,It's the real deal.,Try the wing pizza or the BLT Pizza for something unique.","ok I'm upgrading my review - it only takes one dish and the Oski wow  wow wow shrimp blew me away.,It was perfectly executed: hot, crispy, with just the right amount of sauce: imagine healthy buffallo wings - and it was a busy world cup final atmosphere. .,Who says you can't get decent shrimp in the Midwest?,My mom does - she's from the Philippines and hasn't been here since 1975 - I'm bringing her when she comes next June for my wedding.,Oh and about her - she's a serious wine snob.,Guess what?,They serve Decoy wine - one of the best wineries from Sonoma.,Didn't want my positive review for server Jessie to get lost - she was very kid friendly and efficient.,Manager Derrick and staff are young, friendly, and motivated to make this place the best sports bar in south central.,They tell me to come back for the thin crust stone baked pizza.,I certainly will.","Great pizza, hands down awesome crust and toppings.,We had the Forager and the balance between mushrooms meatiness and spinach earthiness was spot on.,Good service and modest price makes this is a winner choice.,Arugula and delicate squash salad was very unique and not too sweet in spite of the cranberry pur\u00e9e and citrus dressing.,Give it a try if you are in the mood to try something different.","Got a flyer on our door so we thought we'd give them a try. . . glad we did! We took advantage of their \"anytime party special\" of 2 pizzas, garlic balls and a soda.,Excellent crust- hand tossed but not too thick and chewy.,Great texture and flavor! Garlic balls were also good- I like a little more garlic flavor, but they were definitely good! We will explore other items they offer in the future!","I'm not usually one to criticize, but I read the good reviews for this place and it seemed like a pretty safe bet.,Went on a Saturday evening and the place wasn't crowded at all ;-) Our server, Matthew was fantastic - a really nice guy. .,We ordered a large pizza with 4 toppings but the pizza arrived with only 3 of the 4.,Matthew was very apologetic and said he would bring us a glass of wine on the house for the mistake.,He left and returned a few minutes later saying they wouldn't allow him to give us a free glass of wine, but he could take the charge off of the bill.,Being a business owner myself, I though, hmmm, pretty poor customer service.,The pizza itself was fine, however, we ordered it with sliced tomatoes and much to our chagrin, it seems the tomatoes were the first thing put on the pizza because there was no sauce, cheese or anything else under them and they covered 80% of the pizza.,The sausage was sparse at best with maybe 10 pieces on the 18\" pizza.,The crust was so thin in the center that it couldn't even hold the tomatoes without disintegrating.,So it was disappointing, but on the other hand, the patio was very nice and Matthew was great.,If I could give the management one piece of advice, it would be to never let a customer leave disappointed - it may have cost him a glass or two of house wine, but I would have returned.","Do yourself a favor: Order Carry Out, not delivery.,I order here like twice a month, but about 1/3 of the time I order delivery they attempt to deliver my pizza to the wrong apartment. .,Not sure why their drivers can't plug my address into Google Maps and figure out where I am.,The staff at this location have proven to be incredibly incompetent and I am sick of giving them 2nd, 3rd and 4th chances.","It's been awhile since my first visit to Charbar when it first opened and although I didn't have the best experience that time around, I must say that I've truly enjoyed my last three visits here! All of them have been for their brunch or lunch service.,I've been able to try the deep fried french toast bites, bagna cauda, asado plate, jamon crudo pizza, and during Big Taste their feature breakfast burger. .,Today I ordered one of the lunch features which was a pizza that featured roasted chicken and crispy chicken skin on top! Like what, who does that?! The crispy chicken skin is what sold me and I definitely thought it finished off the pizza so well.,Their pizza dough by the way is bomb because it comes from Sidewalk Citizen =) Our server today was lovely (I wish I remembered his name, I am the worst at that!) He was very personable and made sure we were taken care of throughout our meal.,And just a small thing that I noticed was that more than one person (that didn't include our server) ensured that we always had water in our glass.,I appreciate that attentiveness because it really shows that they work as a team. .,P.,S. their beef fat fries are amazeballs! They are the type of fries that you can't stop eating no matter how full you are. .,Reserving my last star for when I am able to go back and try their dinner menu again, but if my last few visits indicate anything, I'm sure it won't be hard to give =)","In the past, there were spans when I would order pizza WAY too often.,Lately, I've been eating a lot healthier. . . though, I'm not made of stone. .,Of the delivery pizza places, I like Pizza Hut the most.,Their on-line ordering feature is extremely intuitive, allowing you to visually customize your exact order. .,This particular location just so happens to be the one assigned to deliver to my location.,In the short time I've lived here, I've always had pleasant experiences with the delivery people.,They always seem to be happy, and are decently engaged.,Also, they always seem to arrive early or on-time. . . which is kind of important. .,All in all, the Via Linda Pizza Hut is a reliable choice for a decent pizza in my opinion. .,If you're looking for a tasty break from the normal pizza, try a Thin Crust Chicken + Jalapeno. . . but be warned. . .,I think Pizza Hut harvests some of these peppers from the center of the sun.,Not ALL of them. . . but there are a few that make you sniffle something fierce.","A place that delivers in Gilbert?,Yes, yes, yes!!! I wasn't certain while using the app for delivery whether it was accurate or not.,I've spent the past 9 months in Gilbert with very limited delivery options.,When I say limited, I mean, there's been but a couple pizza joints to order from. .,I'm not really a pizza enthusiast so, I've starved many late nights for this reason. .,I always check just to see if there have been changes.,Well, two places apparently deliver.,In my disbelief, first thing I did was call to check since they appeared to be a little ways away.,The gentleman was very kind on the phone in confirming they'd come out to us.,I used the app to place my order because I feel it's much easier that way.,Therefore I was basing it off of the menu on here.,I ordered samosas for the kid, a combo beef shrimp kabob platter for the man, a side of kabuli style rice and the vegetable qorma.,I was so excited! Within minutes I received a call from the restaurant to inform me they no longer served the vegetable qorma, and so went with the spinach qorma instead. .,Honestly, the call alone was a very noble move on their end.,Not to mention, I just checked to see what it was that I ordered and it appears that the menu has already been updated on the Yelp app so, kudos for that as well!.,Although the wait time was closer to the 75 minute mark, the order arrived still hot and correct. .,That rice?,So so so so so good! I didn't try much of anyone else's dishes and can't speak to much more other than they looked appealing and no one complained.,The 7 year old didn't even make a stink about this foreign item that she devoured.,I may have skipped the extra side had I realized my dish came with some but I had it today, four days later, for lunch and it was still off the chain. .,We will definitely order from here again and I will definitely tell all of the neighbors about the place!","We were traveling in the area and our first visit we both ordered seafood dishes and were less than impressed.,My brother's shrimp gnocchi dish was fishy smelling and tasting, my crab fish dish tasted like cheap frozen fish or old fish.,However, the 2nd night we ordered Italian and were very satisfied.,We enjoyed both the Mediterranean and the Caesar salads and then a pizza and a stuffed pizza (their version of a calzone).,Definitely go Italian.","On the positive side, the place has nice ambiance and the staff is very friendly.,On the negative side, the food just isn't that good and our service was a bit slow.,We tried the crispy chicken sandwich which was a bunch of bun and a small piece of chicken.,Two different burgers were tried with the sides mixed up on each.,Last was a wood fired pizza which came out 15 minutes after everything else.,It was evidently the pizza guys first night, and it showed.,The pizza was soggy in the middle and not what a wood fired pizza should be.,I would love to say I would try again, but when 4 out of 4 entrees are average to not good, it is hard to recommend.","The Ruben pizza was really pretty awesome.,I would eat this again any day.,We ordered the club pizza as well, but it left a little to be wanted and didn't disappear as quickly.,I would give a 3. 5 if I could, but take points away for being cash only.","I really enjoyed this place.,It was cheaper than the nearby hotels, the little food spot right outside the habitat elevators was decent for breakfast sandwiches and pizza.,Not to mention their rad staff there who were always pleasant! I had a stellar view of the high roller which looked beautiful at sunrise.,I will definitely stay here again.,Thanks, Flamingo!","I would like to give Danny Boys three stars, but it's better than all the competition that I've tried in the area as far as taste, price and quality of pizza.,I really haven't found a pizza I can devote myself to in this area. .,The garlic knots that came with the salad were delicious.,We really enjoyed the thin crust pizza we had when we dined in.,Very tasty pepperoni and Parmesan recipe. .,The regular crust pizza we ordered for carry out next time was pretty good too, but not as good as the thin. .,Some of the specialty pizzas really looked good.,Can't wait to try them. .,It's not Coccia House, but what is.","Great casual atmosphere - sorta retro trendy.,If you've been to the Joe's real BBQ in old town Gilbert, then you know the setup here, grab your food and choose to eat inside or outside in the family friendly open-air 'back yard'.,I prefer the latter, built out of an old farmhouse (I understand it was the owner's childhood home) there lots of mature trees, green grass, not to mention the small working farm behind the restaurant really helps to  transport you back to a time when this area wasn't a sea of cookie-cutter homes and Walgreen's on ever corner. .,Enough about the place, what about the food.,I'd say if you're looking for BBQ go to Old town, they have it here, and it's good, but it's not the same.,Personally, I think the grilled pizza's really stood out, noticeably fresh ingredients really were a flavorful surprise - definitely not the 'Mall-food' someone else here had mentioned. .,I enjoyed it and Joe's Farm Grill it's a perfect place for a Sunday afternoon lunch with the family to get out and enjoy a beautiful Arizona day!","This is our favorite pizza place in Las Vegas for more than 10 years now.,We just keep coming back!May it be for lunch, dinner or party! Yummy pizza, fries, gyros, phily cheesesteak and many more! My kids love their meat lovers and chicken alfredo pizza.,Ben, the owner is awesome too!  May it be dine in, pick up, take out or delivery. . . you wont be disappointed!","Good hot dog, great fries and the best pizza puff in the state! We just ordered a few things but will be back for more.","4. 5/5! Definitely one of Toronto's best kept secrets when it comes to thin crust pizza! Recommend the antipasti minto to start and the famous Bufalina pizza (large enough to share depending on appetite)!","Eh. . . it's pizza pizza.,Looks like pizza.,Tastes like what you would expect.,Comes hot, maybe fresh. .,Not a lot of other places open here at midnight. .,Washrooms aren't too clean and smells a bit weird. . .,Oh, I think their Large with 3 toppings and 3 cans has actually gotten cheaper from before cause we got it for $13. 99 plus tax.","Discovered Tryst (Organic) Cafe shortly after it opened about 2+ yrs ago.,Have had breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner there.,They have organic everything - food, beer, wine, even vodka - which is what drew me at first.,Also many gluten free choices. .,They've had their ups &amp; downs with service, but it's usually good.,The happy hour is limited and should be improved in both hours &amp; choices. .,My wife &amp; I both love their Seered Ahi Tuna Salad, it's fantastic! We both want and need a good organic cafe in the area and hate to see the pizza place next door packed while the healthy restaurant is lightly filled.,Help Tryst thrive!","Recently I noticed a sign outside my local Pizza Nova advertising a medium pepperoni pizza for $4. 39 on Tuesday May 12 for walk in customers. $! from each sale is going to support Variety Village.,I walked in today and tried one.,It was a fresh tasty well made pizza.,My only quibble was that it had too much salt for my taste.,I applaud their gesture of support for a fine cause.,The regular walk in price for that basic pizza is $8. 49.","My boyfriend and I heard about this place from a friend so we decided to try it out.,Food and service was awesome! We had Tyler as our server; he was super nice and just the right amount of attentive.,He also was really knowledgable about their beer list as well as the menu. .,We ordered a lot more food then we could have finished, but it was all amazing.,The chicken wings with fries as delicious (I'd take a giant bowl of the fries alone because they were addictive), garlic buns (easily a meal in itself) that were actually garlicky, and we got the smallest size \"Back Home\" pizza (I think that's what it was called) which we took half home for leftovers. .,Definitely recommend Naked City Tavern.,It's nice to have a place to just relax with good beers and good food locally.","What a wonderful find! Delicious, inventive, hand-crafted food, together with warm &amp; welcoming service in a fun Downtown locale.,We enjoyed everything we tried, and since there were four of us and we did everything family style, we tried a lot! Highlights included the beets &amp; gnudi, the mushroom polenta, the cacio e pepe, the butternut squash agnotti, and the butterscotch dessert.,The bacon/onion/egg pizza and crispy pancetta cavatelli were also great.,Thanks to Eric for superb service and to James, the chef, for creating a truly terrific restaurant and coming out to chat with us.,We'll be back again and again.","Used to go to the River location often when I lived on the Westside.,I now go to the Broadview Heights location and the food is great! The service has always been so so at either location, but the food makes up for it.,REAL better ingredients, better pizza! Nothing in B heights or Royalton comes close!","The pizza was good but a little cold, delivery took longer than expected, but all in all the pizza was good.,I will highly recommend if you are a fan of good pizza.","The last time we ordered from this place is took an hour and a half to get our food.,We decided to give it another try, we ordered tonight, they said it would be 45 mins-1 hour.,THREE HOURS later we call them ( for a second time) and they say the pizza is still at the restaurant, \"we got busy, we can't help it\".,I can understand getting busy, but why would anybody even want a pizza that's been sitting there for more than 2 hrs?! And we're less than 5 miles down Durango from them.,The food is decent, but we won't be ordering from them again.,Don't waste your time.","Guy's Pizza Co. Coventry Location has an average of 2. 5 stars, say what?! I can't believe these 1 and 2 star reviews!?,I have always experienced friendly and fast service at this Guy's pizza location.,Although I have to admit the only time I go here is before I go to a show at the Grog Shop.,I'd have to say I like the NYC small pizza joint vibe.,The place is always filled with HS kids hanging out, laughing, and eating. .,It has been my tradition ever since Guys opened on Coventry Rd and the Grog moved to its south Coventry Rd location - that before a show I get a slice of pizza and a can of Tahitian Treat for only $2. 75!.,On this particular evening before the Chelsea Peretti - America Treasure Tour show.,I went in for my ritual slice &amp; can of TT. And there was no more TT!!! I was sadden by the lack of product and the counter girl shared my disappointment.,I reluctantly ordered a Sprite.,As I left the manager came in with a whole bunch of Tahitian Treats -and the counter girl gave me one on the house!! Granted it's only $0. 75 but, it was the thought that counted and for that I give them 5 STARS!!!!.,By the looks of the other reviews they don't do delivery or big orders well.,So, I say if you want a quick bite while shopping, walking around Coventry, or before a show this the place to go!","My husband and I came here for the first time on Friday night and had a blast.,Our Server Jamie was FABULOUS and totally made our experience top notch!!

Very swanky in red and black.,The location is nice too, it seems an odd place for a lounge but I like it.,I don't have to go to the strip or downtown to get that little bit of extra over your regular neighborhood bar. .,It's pretty mellow and quite enough to have a conversation, which is a rare find for a bar! But on my most recent visit last night (a Friday night) it was getting a little loud with a band setting up.,Nevertheless the vibe is what sells me on this place.,I'm heading there again tonight for a 1st date.,Hopefully the Saturday night vibe doesn't kill the chill lounge vibe. .,Lastly, on the menu, this is why it only gets 3 stars.,I haven't eaten much here but nibbled on a few fries, or the like, from others plates.,I don't remember  finding much for vegetarian options.,They seem limited to the pretzel bites, make your own pizza, or a veggie burger.,They don't even have a vegetarian salad, how odd is that?,It's a SALAD. You're supposed to be focusing on the veggies in that case.,Pretty boring in my opinion.,Asking for subtractions or substitutions is a pain but if your diet is other than avid carnivore you'll need to be that person here.,Friends that are carnivores say the food is good though.","Great food, great vibe.,Had cheese pizza, risotto with spinach, chilis, and sweet potato, and amazing sangria.,We went during the day, and the vibe was very laid back and comfortable for all (my husband and I went with our 2 and 6 yr old, and met up with other family members, adults and kids, and we all had a blast).,Walked by later that night and clearly this is the place to be.,Will be returning as soon as I come back to town.","Good thin crust pizza.,We had the Dough Knots as an appetizer, the 10-inch Popeye Pie for dinner and took home a slice of the Italian Creme Cake.,Can't complain -- all was tasty.,Best part?,The price.,The cake was somewhat of a splurge ($6. 50, but the slice is huge) - otherwise, it would have been a $12 dinner for two. .,We'll be back to try more pizzas. .,We were there early for dinner on a Wednesday and it was not crowded (not shocking. . . ).,Our order was taken at a table, though several people came in to order to-go and went straight to the counter.","This place is my go-to pizza delivery joint.,Ordering via GrubHub, my delivery is consistently on time, accurate, and hot.,In the many times I've ordered from Little Nippers I have never had a bad order. .,Their pizza is pretty tasty for Pittsburgh standards.,Hoagies are on point!.,Their prices are really reasonable--they're a great go-to when ordering out!","The best Chicago style pizza in town!

If I have another chance to come back while in Scottsdale, I definitely will!","The Good:  Great, friendly service with a smile and laid back atmosphere. .,The Bad:  The crust was not all that I thought it would be.,Instead of being dense and buttery, it was really light and fluffy.,Not what I was expecting from a deep dish crust.,Normally eating 1 or 2 slices of Chicago deep dish is enough to make you throw in the towel but I ate 4 slices and ehh, not so much stuffed.,The sauce was awesome however. .,The Ugly:  Spinach on pizza was undercooked and slimy.,Probably just a fluke this time but still off-putting.,If you are looking to listen to loud tv's and drink, go to Native New Yorker.,Several people found this out the hard way that they can't turn the volume up louder after ordering 5 pitchers of beer, only to give it away for free to people sitting behind them so they could leave for Native.","The Original is an iconic restaurant in Pittsburgh that has started to rest on its laurels.,They know people will come here and fork over their money so they can say they ate at \"The Dirty O. \".,The Original has been around forever--my father-in-law would eat there in the '60s when he was a student at Pitt.,The hot dogs are fine, the burgers are fine, the pizza is fine.,There is nothing overly mind-blowing about the place. .,Oh, and the sauerkraut was COLD. A definite turn off in my book. .,The fries are good, but I didn't find anything all that special about them.,The employees do their jobs, but don't expect an exciting interaction with them. .,Quite honestly, the best thing about the Original is the upstairs seating area.,It's quiet and doesn't smell like grease.,AND it has great views of the public milling around the area. .,As a Detroiter who has consumed coney dogs her entire life, I can say that The Original has nothing on the hot dog shops of Detroit.,Skip the Original.,It's not even worth saying, \"I've eaten there!\"","Second Sunday we've ordered from here.,After moving into the Waterford apartments we'd been trying to find good delivery and I think we find it! The delivery service is amazing.,Can't get over how nice the delivery man was.,Best service I've ever had.,And the margarita pizza was beautiful just as he said.,We're definitely making this our new Sunday pizza place! Thanks so much!!","I went here for my birthday after hearing about it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and it is very delicious.,I love the food here, especially the Southwest burger and grilled pizzas.,Not to mention the atmosphere is family-friendly and carries a good vibe.,I plan on returning there again for my next birthday lunch!","Nice patio in the back with lots of afternoon sun.,The pizzas are very good, and they've got a rotating list of daily specials which are reliable. .,I ordered a perrier to drink and the waiter brought over a huge bottle for the table, cracked it open, and poured before I could say I just wanted a glass.,Not a huge deal, but I didn't like the assumption that I wanted the biggest size they offered. . . and sometimes that's all it takes to annoy you for the rest of a meal. .,Sandwiches are huge! Probably the best Italian sandwiches in the area (although 2x the price of most places).","We had our food delivered, it was delivered much sooner than expected.,We had the Italian sub, fried mushrooms, philly style fries, and the ultimate pizza.,Everything was delicious, the pizza was not skimpy on toppings at all, the sub was perfect and much bigger than expected, I'm really picky with fried mushrooms and am typically disappointed at most restaurants but these were the best I have ever had.,Will definitely be returning in the future!","The appearance and customer service are great, but as a native Chicagoan I gotta say that I was disappointed with the pizza.,Perhaps its because I ordered a simple pepperoni, but it definitely NOT Chicago-style pizza.,If you are a native Chicagoan, don't waste your time.","Do you know how difficult it is to make a 5-star Hawaiian pizza?,Maybe you don't like Hawaiian pizza, maybe you don't care.,But as a lover of Hawaiian pizza I can tell you that is very easy to make a 3-star Hawaiian pizza and exceedingly difficult to make a 5-star Hawaiian pizza.,The one here is it. .,The dough was perfectly cooked and the tomato sauce was delicious.,I assume this applies to all of their pizza too.,But the pineapples were the perfect size of chunks, plentiful, and did not soak through the dough.,The ham was not thin slices or cold cut ham; but rather thick chunks of cured pork.,Add to that a dash of the chilli-olive oil that they bring to the table, and you've basically got the perfect Hawaiian pizza.,My dad had a different pizza with chicken and it also looked awesome (he said he loved it though I did not try it). .,For dessert I had the tiramisu, and I cannot complain - clearly homemade, terrific balance of sweet and coffee flavouring. .,Piola is near queen and dufferin, a bit far from the downtown core.,I will be back; It is worth the trip!","Well what can i say about Rocky's.,Its one of the few Pizza places i like to eat from and im not a real Pizza lover. .,Pizza is nice thin crunchy crust with an amazing sauce. .,First time i ate there i ordered a pepporoni slice, and thats where it all started. .,After that we ordered a full pizza, my wifey was in pizza heaven (major pizza lover) it was delicious, didnt complain one bit. .,Tried one of there baked subs and it was tasty too. (Meatball Sub).,Wings were great too, nice and spicy and very good. .,Only thing is they dont have fountain drinks, they sell soda by the can, tea, gatorade, water and are not open that late. .,All n all it was good.","Ya just can't beat a 50% off deal! While the appeal of free food brought us in the door, it did get these guys on our radar.,Up until recently, we had no idea they were right around the corner given their prime real estate (sarcasm). .,I generally liked as many things as I disliked here.,The owners and staff are very friendly, but the location and the interior are pretty lack luster.,The parking lot can be a real pain to maneuver through if it's crowded, or if Old Statesville has a good bit of traffic- which it usually does.,Interior is a bit tight. .,The food is another 50/50.,The grinders are good.,Pizza?,Meh, definitely had better. .,My top negative would be pricing.,This definitely isn't your top notch \"NY style\" and you pay $$$ for it.,Comparing the pizza quality, I'd say it resembles a CiCi's.,Comparing the pizza pricing, I'd say a large, true NY style (just up the road, given) is the same price as a small \"NY style\" here. .,So again, you can expect pretty great customer service and real decent grinders here (and maybe other menu items too).,Haven't tried their buffet either, so that might be cool. .,Personally, it's just hard to justify their pricing.,Will be looking out for the coupons!","Very disappointing. . .,And here is why. . . . 1) $16 cab ride from Encore, which is already on the north end of the strip. 2) neighborhood itself is very seedy and impossible to get a cab AFTERWARDS. Ended up going to a gas station and a local pizza delivery guy gave us a ride. (Note: order from Prima Pizza!!). 3) bartenders and cocktail waitresses were both yawning multiple times! It was only midnight.,Not a great tone to set for patrons. . 4) I asked for a Moscow Mule and they were 'out of' ginger beer.,What kind of speakeasy doesn't have ginger beer. . 5) I settled for their 'House Speciality' drink the 'Expressionist', which was okay, but the bartender didn't even know the ingredients so she had a reference her cheat sheet.,Lame. . 6) I asked for a Kir Royal for my wife.,A very basic and simple drink but bartender said she didn't know what it was and made no effort to ask. . 7) $14 per drink for all of the above is a joke. .,Ended up costing $16+$31+7 (tip for pizza guy)= $53 for two mediocre cocktails. .,Won't be back.","There aren't a lot of places in the Montreal region you can get your hands on some great authentic Napoletan pizza.,This place is a regular for my wife and I. .,I won't go into all the details but the Pizzas are great.,Thin crust, focus on the quality of the ingredients.,Fresh and tasty. .,Quebecois beware.,There aren't handfuls of toppings, the Quebecois couple we invited with us once were shocked to have been deprived their usual bucket of toppings that dilutes the taste of a well done wood oven cooked pizza. .,The arancini balls are very very good. .,Their Nutella Pizza is a favorite of ours too. .,Service is quick and friendly. .,My highlights are when the owner passes by and says hello and I get to converse some of my rusty Napoletan. :)","I got my order to go.,My veggie pie was ready when I arrived.,The price was very reasonable.,The place was clean, had a fresh and trendy appearance, and outside seating if desired. .,I came here because they have a vegan pizza that is made with hummus instead of fake cheese! I thought this was so awesome, but you can see from the picture that the hummus is just mainly piled on top in the middle instead of spread uniformly over the pizza as a base.,So basically you eat the pizza with veggies on it, and then take a spoon to the center to get the hummus.,All of the ingredients tasted good despite the awkward assembly. .,Service was bland. . .,Not rude. . .,But never smiled. .,Regardless, I give this place a thumbs up because it offers real vegan pizza!","Monroe's is a cool little basement bar in downtown Phoenix.,Just by existing, it creates a sense that Downtown Phoenix isn't just a pathetic excuse for a city that was simply plopped on top of the desert.,It gives the area character.,It's one of those places that help make downtown feel more like a much cooler city that has an abundance of stuff like this. .,You blink and you might miss it, but once you find the door and descend the stairway you'll find yourself inside a dark and cozy spot lined with old woods and bookended by a wrap-around bar and a stage where they sometimes have musicians play.,The atmosphere is pretty inviting, but it helps if you bring a buddy so you don't feel like an outcast. .,There are tables and chairs to sit at and the place is capable of accomidating groups.,They serve food as well of course and the food is good.,I've had pizza there and I thought it was quite tasty.,Nothing to write home about, but I'll yelp about it. .,It's the sort of place that sets the scene for \"anything can happen\" night. . . sorta like Chez Nous did, but in a different way.,Definitely worth the trip. . edit: I went here last year, and I've learned it may be closed now (although a search on the web turns up nothing about closure). . . definitely needs confirmation.","The dining commons excels in offering an impressive array of desserts, beverages, and salad bar options but could use a boost to its main entree selections.,Here's my beef with the DC: there's a sandwich station that boasted a menu with a pesto caprese option.,Being that I love caprese (and it was the only vegetarian option), it was the logical choice to go caprese.,Come to find out, the \"pesto\" is actually pesto mayo and there is no basil on the sandwich! You simply cannot omit basil from caprese.,It's one of the main goddamn ingredients! I made do with lettuce instead, and my sad faux caprese ended being okay for a light lunch snack. .,Besides the salad bar and the sandwich station, there's a pizza and pasta bar and what looked like a Chinese food section.,I grabbed some fries that were set up to a hot dog station to finish up my main course. .,Dessert is where it's at! There was brownies, cupcakes, cookies, and a Dryer's ice cream machine complete with chocolate sprinkles waiting to be scooped up.,The brownies and ice cream were yummy.,Beverages available include a Nestle hot chocolate machine, coffee, soda, juice, and lemon water to name a few.,I was super impressed that they had chocolate and vanilla soymilk on standby!.,When you're all done eating, there's a conveyor belt where students drop off all their dishes.,I'd compare the quality of the food at the dining commons to EDR food or any other cafeteria type place.,Most things are just okay, but there are a few standouts.,My lunch date got a turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce and stuffing, and she absolutely loved her food. .,YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #254","best pizza in the area by far. one of the best i've ever had. the seafood pizza is absolutely amazing. great service and they go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied.  so for everyone who said they had an unpleasent experience next time open your mouth and say something or don't complain. unfortunately we know people who have avoided the restaurant because of some of the reviews people have written.  if you don't like the pizza then that's your opinion.  i understand but i eat there quite often and have never had a bad experience . i have never talked to anyone who has either.  for those of you who are wondering no i am not th owner but i am one of his best customers i bet. the only reason i am giving them 5 stars is because it wont let me give them 6. to the management of fat bobs keep up the great work and for god sakes don't change the sea food pizza.","Holy Meatza Pizza !!! We ordered the Guys XL Meatza Pizza last night with the thin crust and it was ridiculously delicious.,The toppings were full of flavor and loaded on to edges.,The thin crust was not as crunchy as I prefer, but the meat stacked upon this beast of a pizza made up for it.,So the XL pizza is freakishly large.,I ordered it with hopes of having leftovers, but I never would have thought it would be enough for several days worth! .,Delivery was a bit slower than ideal, but they were upfront about the timing.,I would definitely give this place a chance if you are looking for a slice of good ol' fashioned greasy goodness.","A place with only French Fries and Ice Cream - what a divine idea!  It's easy to find gourmet ice cream parlors, but gourmet french fries are a new treat!  .,I recently visited and was immediately struck by the ambience of the inside.,Although the restaurant is enclosed, it has high ceilings and a pickup window which helped give it a vibe of being outside, particularly close to a fun beach location.,Whether it's the thought of gourmet french fries and ice cream that helped fuel the \"vacation\" vibe, I definitely got a nice break from reality when I walked in.  .,I ordered the pizza fries with pepperoni and man were they yummy!  Crispy hand-cut fries seasoned with fresh herbs, perfectly melted cheese and topped with baby pepperonis, all with marinara sauce for dipping.,It was amazing!  I don't know why more pizza restaurants don't convert to serving pizza this way, it was a really inspired!  .,This place warrants a visit, whether you order or just enjoy the ambience and drool over the menu while you're there.,No matter your tastes, sweet or savory, Sweetie Fry has something you will enjoy!","i've gone to bottega twice, the first time it was \"ok\", the second time it was terrible. i don't understand what the hype is, i love good pizza. i've had amazing pizza in rome, venice, boston, and nyc. i have to find great thin crust brick oven pizza in montreal and when i heard about bottega i thought \"this is it! finally good pizza in montreal!\" but alas, not to be. i judge a pizzeria by their margherita, if you can't make a good margherita pizza then whats the point. the first time my pizza had no cheese, and i mean maybe 20% coverage. . i would say a good thin crust pizza should have about 50% cheese coverage, a few nice pieces of fresh mozarella. the second time i come i ask for a little extra cheese to compensate for last time, and what i got was barely edible. it was as if the cheese and sauce had fused into this pink watery slime. the crust was soaked. it was one of the worst pizzas i've ever eaten. . maybe i need to give them another shot, but at what point do you stop giving a restaurant chances to get even the most basic things right? i don't recall the sauce being anything remarkable either.","The idea behind this place is great.,It screams nostalgia for any gamer while providing really good pizza.,The pepperoni pizza was delicious.,The crust was cooked to perfection and the cheese was gooey and melted.,They carry a variety of canned sodas, my personal favorites including Grape soda and Vanilla Dr. Pepper! Being able to play video games while you wait for your order is what makes this place so unique.,Each table against the wall has at least one system hooked up varying from NES to the Wii U and PS3! Overall great place. 4 stars instead of 5 because of location size.,It could be so much more if moved to a larger location.,But, start small and grow Super Pizza Bros.","Parents took me here while I was home for Labor Day.,We walked right in on a Saturday evening, no wait.,Place is nice and open inside, especially on a nice day with the patio open. .,We got a large pizza with mushrooms and sweet peppers and an order of their wings.,I was intrigued by the wings because there isn't a vast list of flavors like other wing joints--just their blend.,I was a bit skeptical when my dad told me they come covered in saut\u00e9ed onions, but wow were they good.,Seasoned perfectly with their special blend of spices and the onion flavor seeped in.,Tasted like a chicken wing should, not trying too hard to mask the actual taste.,I wish I had taken a picture so you could see the onion pile, which we ate on the pita bread that came with It (my dad also added some to his pizza when it came. ).,The pizza was also quite good.,I loved the mushrooms because they were cooked differently than the normal soggy type that shows up on pizza.,My only complaint, and I know it's coal oven pizza, is that the edge of our pizza crust was very burnt.,The bottom wasn't, but the edge of about half was extremely blackened.,I think it needed spun more in the oven while cooking to even it out.,But I'd still definitely return, it was even good cold for breakfast leftovers the next day!","Found out about Dino's from a neighborhood post, went with my family for dinner, was not disappointed, food was delicious, had a Caesar salad and a 16 inch pizza , the crust was amazinggggg, so crispy , not something I come across too often living in AZ. .,The staff is super friendly, the only thing I will mention is that they are clearly still putting the finishing touches together on the look and presentation, and are not quite all set up, but they are only open for 3 weeks and they haven't had their official grand opening, but I will definitely be back and recommend it to everyone! I mean at the end of the day its the food and service that matters to me and they are a 10 in both!!!","Tops is the oddball little neighbourhood dive bar/sports bar that I would be happy to call my local watering hole. .,Cont'd below, but first off - As far as pizza goes, Tops are total champions! Super heavy yet not greasy, and loaded the hell up with tasty toppings, Tops does pizza right.,We got the New Yorker half and halfed with the Spartan pizza.,Steak bites, mushrooms, green pepper, onions and bacon stripes [sic] (actia;;u there were a tonne of spelling mistakes on this menu - @yycist would have a hayday) meets donair meat and banana peppers.,It's unruly delicious.,It's also close to $40 for an XL (14\"). a Worth it?,Yeah, we both had leftovers. .,You start getting north and what happens?,Unfortunately the bars get further and further away.,You'd better hope you live next to a fits-all bar that fits you.,Or, you know, you could just live a lifestyle that doesn't involve having a close to home spot where you can drink, eat, and befriend the other drinkin' eatin' locals. . .,But I don't even want to entertain that as a possibility. . . .,Now I say sports bar/dive bar.,On first look, Tops is surprisingly nice, sporting a giant guitar in the roof.,On the ground, the bar counters shadow the outline of the giant guitar.,Where the fretboard is, is a long bar height table good for conversational seating for up to 8 people.,But for some reason I can't help but think that it is merely lipstick on a pig. . .,Maybe it was the human feces smeared along and adjacent strip mall glass door, and then piled on the sidewalk below, as I approached Tops. . .,Maybe. .,But Tops can't be blamed for that, it wasn't even their business! Well, yes it wasn't their business, but can they be blamed?,Ehn, I have a feeling that's a different story altogether. . .,I don't yet know the denouement.","My family and I tried this restaurant for a grad celebration, based on the great reviews on Yelp and it sure delivered! Our party of 4 ordered a few apps to share as well as 3 mains. .,The highlights were the antipasto Della Casa, margherita pizza and agnolotti.,I also need to mention how delicious the tiramisu was - and I'm a chocolate cake kinda girl!.,Service was also phenomenal - we can't wait to return!!","What went wrong is the service.,We called for a delivery of 2 pizzas at 19h30 on a tuesday night since the weather was terrible outside, even if we live 10 minutes walk away.,An hour later, we receive a call saying that our pizzas were missing with their delivery person.,So it's either we wait for the delivery to show up (after already waiting for an hour) or we pick it up ourselves.,We were shocked to find this out an hour after our order, when we were specifically told there was a 30 minute wait before getting our pizzas, which we accepted.,This is very disapointing for the fact we needed to walk in the terrible weather to pick them up, getting them more than an hour and a half later. . . .","Always searching for a lunch deal - that's me.,Luigi's may become my near West side place to go when I am out doing errands and crave some cheezy fresh pizza and a salad. .,Lunch special - ANY pizza at 6 inch size with ANY small salad for $8. 99.,That is a good deal when the pizza is truly handmade with fresh mozz. .,I chose the housemade spicy sausage pizza and the arugula salad.,Crust was thin and perfect really. (fyi- I am super picky about pizza crust. ) Sausage was tasty. .,The salad was BIG for a small salad; it came with lots of caramelized onions, walnuts and fresh goat cheese. .,While a 6 in. pizza would not satisfy my husband - for me it is exactly right for lunch. .,Service was very friendly and prompt even though the place was busy at noon with 80% tables full and one large kid party. .,Tables have paper covers and crayons- fun!.,They were offering some fresh fruit Sangrias - which sounded awesome - must go back and try those!","Went for supper around 7:00pm and the place was about 1/3 full.,I've liked the concept that Via Cibo presents, but the details are in the execution.,There is a mix of individual and communal tables.,The rough hewn wood surfaces add to the \"street food\" atmosphere. .,I ordered the specials (mushroom soup &amp; mushroom pizza) and my partner has the pasta primavera and asked for added shrimp. .,Soup flavour was good and pizza was good (I love stone fired thin crust) but both specials were listed as having a \"medley of mushrooms\".,All I saw were sliced button mushrooms.,Further, I'm not a big fan of garnishing a cream based soup with chopped parsley.,Leave the parsley for the clear brothed soups. .,Our biggest concern was with the added shrimp in the primavera.,We don't think they were properly cooked. .,Overall a good concept, but if you do go, stick with the tried and true classics.","My boyfriend and I were so excited for this restaurant to open because it's so close to his house! We have been here three different times and were happy each time.,I suggest going on Wednesdays for wing night! Their wings are great! We also enjoyed the pizza, the crust is awesome.,The meatballs and Cuban sandwich were just okay. . . which is why I chose 4 stars rather than 5.,They also have a great beer selection!","I came here after receiving a free pizza at a Yelp event.,Upper Crust had some of the best food at the event so I couldn't wait to have dinner at the restaurant.  .,My friend and I came here on a Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it was 1/2 off a bottle of wine day.,I can't remember exactly which wine we ordered, but it was a Shiraz and it was good.,We shared a happy hour appetizer of mild wings and a large pepperoni pizza with basil.,It was all so delicious!  .,I also came here a different day with my boyfriend and we shared the meatballs with cheese on top and a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and basil.,Again, it was very tasty!  .,Everyone was very friendly and prompt.,I will be back to Upper Crust!","Great place to come watch a game or grab a bite to eat, the bar is divided in 2 sections, one has a TV and tables which I think is great for having a pizza with friends and family during football season and the the other side has the bar, however you can still order food anywhere, although there isn't a server in this place, Trevor (the bartender) did a great job taking care of us.,I will definitely be coming back for more.","I have to say, this may be my favorite wood fired pizza in central Phoenix. .,I'll have to try Spasso's pizza a few more times to confirm that my infatuation was not the result of a long week, my chemical composition on that particular day, or the peace of a cold beer, but if future experiences are anything like my first, I am a fan! .,The house made mozzarella appetizer is ok.,The steak (that my boyfriend ate) was fine.,The real star here is the pizza, which had a perfectly chewy crust and the meat combination completed a perfect blend of cheesy saltiness. .,The owner was a little overly chatty, but at the same time, how can I blame him when clearly this restaurant is his pet project.,The service was GREAT. . .,I don't think our water glasses were ever empty. .,I have to admit, a small part of my enthusiasm is probably because this restaurant is in Town &amp; Country Mall, which is a terribly under appreciated piece of real estate. . .,I'd love to see this good, family-owned restaurant survive.","I came to Buca with some co-workers for a job well done celebration.,I'm not a real fan of chain Italian restaurants, but Buca is different with the atmosphere, being able to handle large parties, and if course family-style dining.,We were seated in the Pope room which is fun but little freaky.,Pictures of the Pope all over with a head of the Pope on the middle of the table and the Pope chair.,Strange but cool having the Pope watch you eat. .,We started off by having the Mozzarella Garlic bread which was really good, the Chopped Antipasto salad, and the Apple Gorgonzola salad.,The salads were pretty good not great but I thought it had a little too much vinegar for my liking. .,We had the Margherita pizza with fresh mozzarella which I thought was very good, Chianti Braised Short Ribs where they gave us three huge ribs that were boneless and covered in gravy which was very tender and very good.,We couldn't have ribs without Rosemary Potatoes (meat &amp; potatoes kind of guy) and they were really tasty and cooked perfectly.,To top it off we had the Macaroni Rosa that had macaroni (of course) with a creamy sauce and chicken, broccoli and peas.,It was really good.,We ate it all up and had very little leftovers so that tells you the food was pretty good.,No one seemed to be holding back. .,We can't forget about desert so we had the Dolce Platter which included Tiramisu, Double Dark Chocolate cake, Cheese cake, and Apple Crostata.,The deserts were fantastic.,Really good and everyone enjoyed it. .,The service was right on.,Filling up our water glasses, beer, wine, ice tea, and soft drinks.,Food came out in a timely manner too.,So I have no complaints about the service. .,So overall, I had a very good meal with lots of variety of food and massive amounts to fill up everyone.,Coming here is about having a fun time and good Italian food.,So enjoy, eat up but don't forget to unbuckle that belt after you eat all that food.","Tried the Pizza by the slice counter on our first night here at resort, best pizza I've had in a very long time and I'm from Chicago, so believe me, I know my pizza! Decided to try the actual restaurant for dinner tonight.,Ordered Cesar salad for dinner, not very tastey, not enough dressing in salad, but croutons were delicious.,Overall, I would recommend that everyone gives these guys a try.","Being from the midwest, I'd been looking for a place that served Chicago-style deep dish pizza and Yelp helped me locate this place (which just happened to only be about 2 miles from where I live).,Vito's was really good! As it was just me, I had lots of leftovers and they reheated well in the microwave and I think may have even tasted better the 2nd day.,Don't let the location scare you away, give it a try.","I love this place! Very cool, very classy, excellent selection of brews &amp; spirits. $1 off all beers, $2 off all wines, $8 off wine bottles, $4. 50 well drinks during happy hour from either 3 or 4 till 7pm depending on when they open.,Small selection off pizzas &amp; appetizers.,Very nice place to take a date","This location is closed.,The website says they will re-open in a week or so on Fremont Street in downtown LV. .,Decent pizza and cheep beer.,Hope it stays that way when they open downtown","For what this restaurant is, it is a five star all of the way! I found the flavors in the goat cheese and spinach pizza to be far beyond this restaurants price point.,The goat cheese had a fantastic bitter quality to it and the spinach was fresh and cooked to perfection! You could even taste the quality of the olive oil and garlic used.,Far better food, atmosphere, and service than I expected for a bar.,I'm blown away","My husband and I had a late lunch/early dinner, nothing over the top, but not the usual 'chain' meal.,Based on the reviews I read on yelp, we thought we'd give Trattoria Reggiano a go.,We weren't disappointed. .,Never have walked through the maze of shops within and around The Venetian, so we enjoyed the stroll to find T.,R. tucked into a small curve in The Grand Canal Shoppes.,We arrived around 5:00 and had our choice of dining 'in' or 'patio' (which basically means the wide side-walk of the shoppes).,We joined two other parties on the patio (it's always entertaining to people watch in Vegas!). .,Warmly greeted by Amanda (who was fabulous); gave us time to look over the menu.,I wasn't sure about the chianti served by the glass and she offered to get me a sample.,Pleasantly surprised to find it was a nice little chianti and was poured a very full glass of wine ($11).,Hubby and I decided on a starter of Filet Mignon Meatballs ($12) since many reviews highlighted them; very good start to the meal.,Good flavor, great sauce, and nicely proportioned.  .,For dinner, my husband order the Salsiccia pizza ($15) while I, based on Amanda's suggestion, tried the special of  mushroom fettuccine ($16).,In the meantime, the home made garlic rolls arrived (yummy) along with the above mentioned meatballs.,May I add. . . the leftover pomodoro sauce from the meatballs is amazing with the garlic rolls.,Hey, we're on vacation, calories and carbs don't count, right?,Our entrees were served within 12-15 minutes.  .,My husband enjoyed his pizza - especially the pieces of fresh garlic that were cooked in the pizza sauce.,Said it had very good flavor although it didn't look anywhere as good as it tasted.,The crust was nicely browned; crisp but a nice soft center.,However, he agreed that my dish was definitely better.,The pasta was cooked slightly al dente (perfect); the sauce was delicious and not too overwhelming (as I've had at other restaurants); and the mushrooms gave a wonderful depth and texture to the dish.,Amanda had said it was her favorite meal but typically is only served once a month.,Lucky me - it was wonderful. .,The pizza was enough for two as was my pasta.,As we (luckily) have a hotel room with a kitchenette, we took the leftovers with us.,Nice late night snack after spending an evening in the casino, lol.,The ambiance of T.,R. is quite nice; quaint vibe of a Italian cafe much like you see when visiting Italy.,As we visited for an early dinner on a Monday night (10/8/12), there was seating available.,But leaving an hour later, all the tables were full and I noted some people waiting. .,If you're looking for some good Italian food, in a casual setting, with some top-notch service, you'll want to visit Trattoria Reggiano.","Found this gem on yelp of course and enjoyed it very much!

Turkado sandwich was good.,Onion rings are wonderful!","This is a great little pizza joint.,They had a good coupon deal for wings, a pizza, and a hoagie, and everything we got was tasty.,The \"spicy\" Italian hoagie was not spicy in the least, but large and very generous in meat, and very good.,The wings we got were mild but actually more spicy than the hoagie.,The pizza was pretty good, too.","Ordered Novanta for a work lunch yesterday (about 35 people) and the food was phenomenal. . . everyone was raving about how good it was.,My colleague worked directly with Nick to get the right amount of food and the right mix (pizza, salad, antipasti, and cannolis).,We will definitely be using Novanta again for future work events.","I've only been here during their late evening happy hour from 10-2 AM but this is a great spot for some food and drinks.,Usually I order their flatbread pizzas or quesadillas which are both pretty good in my opinion, though the flatbread pizzas seem to be better.,They have a great drinks selection of course and is a great spot for happy hour due to the atmosphere.,It's nice to be able to hang out and relax here. .,Outside of happy hour this review might be different, but from simply reviewing their happy hour I can say that I'm a fan.","I love Pizza 73s pizza.,But this place uses the same spatula to spread the sauces on the pizza.,Many times when ordering a creamy garlic based sauce because I have a tomato allergy.,I have found tomato sauce mixed in with the creamy garlic.,Not impressed","We ordered delivery from Barros and got an XL pepperoni and 24 wings.,The pizza here is AMAZING! It's hard to go anywhere else, get pizza, and say it's good after eating Barro's.,The whole pizza, cheese, sauce, crust, pepperoni, and spices make this pizza extremely tasty.,Again, I cannot reiterate how good it tastes.,The wings, were meh, and a little soggier than what I prefer.,The buffalo sauce tasted good, but I think the wings would be better if the either fried them or baked them a little longer.,I wanted to give them 5 stars overall but feel all items should be up to par to earn this rating.,The wings need a little work but were not bad.,The pizza is for sure 5 stars.,The price is decent too.","Ordered the pizza on my phone.,It said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes.,Went to pick it up.,Worker looked up the order on the computer and said it wasn't ready yet.,Didn't get the pizza until more than 40 minutes after we ordered it! Brought it home (5 minute drive) and guess what - the pizza isn't even hot anymore!!! I'm guessing the pizza was made on time but the order wasn't updated in the system?,I don't know.,But either way - waiting 40 minutes for a cold pizza is totally unacceptable.,I've been to other locations and this has never been a problem.","Have only been here twice but good place to grab a drink and the pho and Vietnamese rolls were pretty tasty, although I would say this is a bonus to being in the bar - not the reason to go here.,Pizza is just there but frankly I didn't go for pizza either.,Owner is very friendly and works hard for her business! But as others note - this is first and foremost a bar.","The pizza is okay, it's an okay place to stop if you are in a hurry and want some pizza.,However, there are much better options if you are setting out for the night with the intent to eat pizza.,Prices are high for what you get and the service is much to be desired.,Usually the girl running the counter acts like there are much better places she would rather be.,So on that note, there are much better pizza places I would like to be at than here.","Wow, amazing service and the most delicious pizza and pasta I've had in a long time! Pizza was picture-perfect and the regular crust had a nice crisp bottom.,Smelled amazing and tasted even better.,Our waiter was so attentive and genuinely nice, he got a 20%+ tip.,Will come here again soon.,This is the East Shea location.","The husband heard of Times Square on PBS and I had had it bookmarked for awhile SO clearly we had to visit.,This place is nowhere near my house, but sometimes it's nice to get out of the neighborhood.,We waited briefly for a table (maybe 15. . . 20 min max).,I had to try the pizza because. . . . you know. . . . pizza. . . and it was decent.,It wasn't mind blowing, but it was good.,The real highlight of the night was the tiramisu. . . .,I love tiramisu and this one was worth the calories.,Anyway, if I were in the neighborhood, I would come back, but I probably wouldn't make a special trip.","It was a beautiful 75 degree day today, made even more perfect with a wonderful lunch outside at Joe's Farm Grill.,We got there early to avoid the line (which rapidly appeared around 11:40am) so our food was ready very quickly after ordering. .,My chicken pesto sandwich was wonderful - the meat was juicy and the peppers and mushrooms were fresh and yummy.,Others in the group enjoyed pizza, burgers, and fantastic sweet potato fries which I couldn't help sampling.,Everything looked and smelled great. .,My only complaint was the condiment area which was very messy with spilled ketchup and ice everywhere.,They needed to send someone out to clean it up more promptly.,Otherwise, Joe's Farm Grill was an excellent lunch experience (as they usually are)!","Don't be fooled by the generic sounding name and dangerous-looking exterior. . .,The food inside is cheap, delicious, filling, and relatively healthy! .,I'm currently training in this neighborhood and don't have a car or the motivation to pack lunch everyday, so yesterday I decided to not judge a restaurant by its exterior and to invite myself in.,I'm actually not a huge fan of pizza (crazy, I know), but saw \"falafels\" on the name banner and as a huge middle eastern food fanatic I knew I needed to at least see the menu. .,I was pretty impressed initially by the pricing although not everything is dirt cheap, especially the salads, which are around $8-12, which is comparable to salads sold in downtown Toronto.,The pizzas looked interesting, and I can see them making them from scratch in the back with all the giant ovens.,I ordered the small falafel platter $5. 69, which came with a whole wheat pita, 3 deep fried falafels that they make on the spot, dipping sauce (tastes like tahini?), and a small aluminum container of side dishes, including hummus, baba gnoush, purple cabbage, marinated mushrooms, salsa, etc.,Trust me, I eat a lot, and despite how small the portions looked, it was all very, very filling as you can expect from fiber and protein.,Everything is supposed to be vegan, but who knows.,There's also a large version of this priced at $8.,Other non-pizza food options include salads, salmon platter, fries, soup of the day (made in-house, changes daily), etc. .,The staff members are very nice, and there always seems to be a steady flow of customers.,Most of the customers are Jewish and look like regulars, so evidently Pizza Cafe has received the stamp of community approval, which truly says a lot about the food!.,They also do catering. .,Will return!","I've eaten here twice for dinner over the last five years and was very pleased on both occasions.,We had pizzas both times.,They are wonderful!   They very much resemble the style we've had in Rome: very thin, crisp crust, light on the creative toppings.,The portobello, artichoke, roasted peppers and fontina one was especially memorable.,Service was very good - prompt, friendly and quick.,Our waitresses were very pleasant.,The prices may seem a little high, so if you want a cheap thick crust gloppy stuffed pizza, go elsewhere.","Just picked up my first pizza from Bruno's.,WOW!!! Best pizza EVER and great service! The crust is amazing and the sauce is yummy!

Its stuffed with pepperoni, meatballs, sausage, and bacon and its a meat lovers dream. .,My only downfall with this place is they clearly get a lot of delivery or pick up calls or something because when we go in, we definitely find ourselves waiting for a pretty decent amount of time before we get our food.,Also, they're closed on Sundays, which is just ridiculous for a pizza place, but, it is what it is.,If you're looking for New York style pizza, come here.","I first visited Humble with my girlfriends shortly after it opened.,We shared a cheese board, a Lardo pizza (with literal pieces of delicious fat on it) and a bottle of Malbec.,It was a casual night that felt a little fancy.,We were tucked in a nice little booth towards the front. .,I recently went back on the most perfect date.,The atmosphere was great, the conversation was easy, the place wasn't too loud even though it was fairly busy and we were placed at the end of a long shared table.,It didn't feel like we were crowded or encroaching on anyone else's space.,There's even a nice patio out front; although, it was a bit too hot to sit outside on the particular night we went.,We shared a cheese board with the server helping us pick our cheeses and I once again ordered a glass of Malbec since I enjoyed it the last time and it was his favorite.,We then ordered a Cabernet Sauvignon (a domestic from California, though I don't remember what at the moment) and everything was very good.,It was a wonderful evening though I never heard from him again so I'm starting to think maybe it was just a head full of yummy wine and an infatuation with this lovely little place ;) haha","All four of us me, my spouse, our 8 year old, and our 6 year old LOVE Jets pizza! It's always hot and fresh.,Their salads are yummy as well!!!","I have such fond memories of Santos' pizza when I was a kid and I've twice convinced myself that this was going to be the same pizza as it was some 40 years ago.,I have also now been twice disappointed. .,In fairness, I have only had their pizza on the two occasions that I visited, and am therefore unable to comment on their other menu offerings, which I should point out is a wide selection of appetizers, sandwiches and other Italian standards. .,For me the pizza just isn't anything to write home about.,The crust is a bit thicker than I like (or recall from my yesteryears), and the flavor for me, isn't anything special. .,The atmosphere gives me a bit of a \"Kitchen Nightmare\" vibe.,That's not in any way meant to infer that the kitchen itself is anything but, but the dated decor and the dark dining room just isn't all that inviting. .,The service was friendly enough.,Not overly welcoming, but not off-putting either.,All in all Santos, to me, comes off as an average, if not a bit tired, Italian Restaurant. .,With that said, I'll probably take another swing at it, and try some of their other dishes.,I'll hold off on any further judgement until then.,For now though, 3 stars seems fair.,It's \"good enough. \"","Jane was really good.,Cocktails were good and original, not very boozy though ($10 each).,Endive, apple, blue cheese and pistachio salad was nicely sized and fresh ($12). \"Schwartz\" pizza (smoked meat, mustard, cheddar, pickles) sounded awful, but was really, really amazing ($20).,This was the standout.,Pasta dish was decent and fresh ($19).,Two of us shared the above and had almost half a pizza and about half a pasta dish to take home.,You can order two starters and share a pizza, easily.,Service was friendly.,We will be back.","Wow the pizza is cold and pepperoni is falling off like an afterthought . . .,WTH sbarro?,Now mediocre isn't even bad enough u have to go sub par with it. . .,Smh","I discovered this place through a delivery app.,Needless to say I've become a frequent customer since.,I still need to try the pizza (I know, that's supposed to be what they're about), but I'm so in love with their hot sandwiches(all of them!!!) that I can't talk myself out of ordering one when I get the craving.,I haven't had anything that hasn't been great.,AND they deliver!!!  Total win-win for me.","Oh be still my heart! I do love me some oreganos.,Sadly, not my favorite location but only because I'm head over heels for the Dobson and 60 patio (I like what I like, okay?!) I've always had quick, pleasant, and accurate service (except maybe one time but I'm giving the guy the benefit of he was just a tad awkward?) at this location and they always get our to go's right as well! .,And HAPPIEST OF DAYS the original veggie wedgie is back!!! I was devastated when they took it off the menu a few years ago and I wasn't pleased with the attempt at a replacement.,But it has returned and I actually did a happy dance when I saw it's back!

I was born and raised in Italy so I'm very picky when it comes to Italian food, and I can honestly say that Trattoria Italiana is my favorite Italian restaurant.,It's family owned and that gives that personal touch that you can't find in the chain restaurants; I met Milena, her husband Ninni, her brother Pasquale, her son Giovanni, Laura the waitress, and they were all so nice to me and my family! I like the atmosphere because it feels like being in a real Italian trattoria, I like the table clothes on the tables (typical in Italian restaurants but not here in the states), the bread is phenomenal, they make it with pizza dough and it's still warm when they bring it to the table, and the list goes on.,I and my family will definitely go back to Trattoria Italiana!

The room was very clean, although not new and remodeled like the website confirmation promised.,The bathroom was a bit dated with old yellow tile floors and an ugly bath tub, but still very clean.,There's a food court in the hotel with fast food and pizza.,The pizza at the food court is a bit pricey, and I recommend getting pizza at the place right next to the elevators.,One slice is HUGE and they're pretty good.  .,My main complaints are that it can get pretty loud during the day from the Drais pool party right next door and that you have to wait a lonnnnggg time for the elevators.  .,I would definitely consider staying here again the next time I'm in Vegas.","2 stars if only for the food (etc. ) The additional star is for the wonderfully cheery petite girl working behind the bar. .,The experience started off odd as I guess I expected this spot to be a little more cool and quaint instead of situated next to a Tilted Kilt (the \"Scottish\" Hooters).,I'm sure the ambiance is much better at night when there is controlled lighting versus the sun blazing in from all the windows.,Anyways, my misconception and this has in no way affected my score. .,Then it didn't help when I walked in on an employee standing up with the hostesses at the entrance loudly bitching about something.,All seemingly in agreement.,So I just interjected with an. . \"I'll just eat the bar\", since I was rolling solo.,Followed by an awkward look exchange with a member of staff standing behind the bar that I was now sitting at.,It was something of a forced smile or perhaps he was squinting due to sun coming in from the window. . . either way he spoke no words. .,Instantly things got better as my bar server approached to greet me and offer a beverage and a lunch menu.,Such a cutie pie this one and nice as nice can be.,And she never let my water get anywhere close to empty and I was drinking it like a fish. .,Often I have trouble deciding on what to order and like to request the assistance of my server who has undoubtably eaten everything on the menu or at least has seen it, so I ask the ray of sunshine which she preferred out of the smoked salmon and the crispy shrimp.,Without hesitation she informs me, \"crispy shrimp!\", her favorite thing.,Sold.,And I also order the simple chopped salad ($5).,Well if that was the best thing I worry about the rest of the menu.,Sure they came out hot and crispy but there was very little flavor.,I actually had to salt them. ( perhaps they took Angie M. 's review to heart too soon).,The sauce was good but only when used sparingly.,The portion was generous but for $13 bucks that should not just be \"filling\". .,The simple chopped salad was alright but very overdressed, rather soggy and the vinegar level in the dressing made my lips burn a bit.,It was also topped with a powdered \"cheese\" similar to that that comes in packets with delivery pizza. .,I left full but thinking I made the wrong decision on where to eat, because it was not worth the 24 bucks it cost here for lunch.,If this restaurant is smart though they will never let go of that little girl behind the bar.,She is a gem.","Can't beat the game deal in the stadium. $25 for a large 1 topping and two drinks, with 1 free refill on each!! You won't eat better or cheaper anywhere else inside that park.,Pizza is huge and so good!! Cannot wait to try their other locations, because the listed menu is limited in the stadium. .,Still they also have pizza by the slice, salads, hoagies, garlic knots (which smelled delicious) and beer specials.,You can order ahead of time, and can use the entrance as a gate into the stadium.,Honestly such a great spot for families at the Pirate game!!","Over priced and under delivers!. - A 12 inch pizza was likely only 10 inch. . - It barely fed the two of us. . - Tasted okay (definitely nothing to brag about). - At $25, this was definitely not worth the price!. - Won't be ordering from there again.","I feel a little weird reviewing a chain, but I had some seriously awesome food here earlier today for lunch.,I came with a couple of friends, and we ordered a bunch of stuff to share.,Sharing is caring after all, ha!.,Anywho, we got a thin-crust wild mushroom pizza, the BBQ chicken chopped salad, and a $30 lunch special for two (one app:  spinach-artichoke dip, two entrees: the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage pizza &amp; the Original BBQ Chicken pizza, and a dessert:  Belgian Chocolate Souffle cake).  .,Everything was SO good.,The Wild Mushroom and BBQ Chicken pizzas were especially delicious.,I don't know how other CPK chains are, but the one in Ross Park Mall is legit.,If you're looking for a good meal after shoppin' up a storm, hit this place up.,This CPK is WAY better than the Cheesecake Factory next door.,Trust me, you'll thank me later!  .,Oh, and the service here was great!  Our waitress was super nice AND quick.","Ordered a Hawaiian pizza, got half Hawaiian, Half Cheese, and half burnt. .,They vaguely describe that their \"sandwiches\" are Calzones.,They're kind of good.","When you're real hungry and not up to paying a big bill, Cici's is the place.,On my last visit at this location I noticed a slight change in the texture of the pizzas.,The crusts should've been cooked more, too doughy.,Maybe higher heat to crisp it up.,Also, couldn't eat the brownies because they difinetely needed 10 min. more in the oven, too mushy.,All else, was very good, and friendly staff, clean dining area, and constant attention by manager in keeping fresh food ready.","This was our date night pick before heading to the theater to see Fantastic Beasts (great movie- highly recommend).,We recently were in Italy and had AMAZING pizza there, but thought this place could at least come close based on what I read.,And we were right! Not quite as good as authentic Italian pizza, but pretty dang close.,Wood-fired and made to order, the add-ons of prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella were worth it.,The glass of wine was a little pricey for the size, but it was a nice house-red.,The cannolis were nothing special, but the husband enjoyed the specialty dessert of a graham cracker cake. .,I do wish they listed the size of the pizza on the menu board.,We were not aware of the size and ordered 1 to split.,They are small enough that 1 is a enough for one person, and we probably could have gotten our own. .,I do love that they offer take-out and if I lived any closer, that could be very dangerous for my wallet with the prices they offer. .,The space is a little off-putting with how small and narrow it is and they have sports tv's around the restaurant as well.,I would have been okay with just the music in the background and no tv's.,Takes away from the Italian ambiance.","All around great experience.,We were greeted by staff welcomed and helped ordering our pizzas.,Our family has been papa Murphy's take and bake customers since 1997 and we were leery of others but my wife and I agree that this summer noble Romans will be our new family favorite!

(Get yours at: http://www. groupon. com/r/uu1775957) .,Used it for my wife's birthday with a group of 8.,We started with a wonderful Pizza that was easily up to NYC standards (Owner Jimmy is from LI). All the starters and especially the Greek Salad had rave reviews.,Cocktails were excellent and the Watermelon Sangria on special hit the spot.,Everyone's entree was declared delicious with ample portions, my lasagna was outstanding and the angel hair pasta had 5 stars.,The highlight of the meal was dessert with the New York Cheesecake as the star of the show.,Second billing went to the very creamy and Gelatos - probably the best in the valley bar none, the Pistachio was very tasty.,The prices are reasonable and the service is excellent. .,On a next visit the Margarita pizza was still up to NYC standards.,The Spaghetti Carbonara was perfection and left my mouth very happy.,The Pasta Arrabiata was an unusual variation and spiced perfectly.,Again the meal ended with the very special gelatos.,It must be mentioned that Enzo's has a large and well-stocked Italian style bakery and shop next to the restaurant plus an outdoor dining area.,And even the bathrooms are over-the-top.","I headed to Mercatto for dinner, to catch up with an old friend.,The restaurant was busy, but mercifully not too loud.,They were also playing some great music - \"Home\" by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros was a standout track. .,I had the gnocchi with duck ragu, which was brilliant.,It's cooked with peas, a vegetable I normally hate, but even they were absolutely delicious.,My friend had a solid prosciutto pizza, and we shared a chocolate and salty caramel pudding that was also quite good - although it could have used more of the rich caramel.,The evening was topped off with a perfect, foamy cappuccino. .,I can't comment on the lunch rush, but I'd certainly recommend Mercatto for dinner.","I could really love @cibocalgary but won't.,The food is lovely enough but the service leaves something to be desired.,It's a shame the staff didn't even make mention of a Happy Hour menu for their $5 Happy Hour pizza, otherwise I would go back.,But they didn't, and I won't.,Not worth the price.","Maybe it had something to do with the fact that it was 1am and I'd had a few beers, but this place serves up some of the most delicious slice pizza in Toronto.,It is run by a Vietnamese couple who are handle the massive amounts of foot traffic through here with diplomacy and poise.,Also given the fact that a lot of said foot traffic takes place in the hours right after midnight, it makes it that much more impressive. .,The slices are thin crust with a light amount of cheese.,Although I enjoy a cheese heavy pizza, when it's on thin crust it's better to go with less as they have here.,The sauce is very tasty and the cheese slice is kind of marguerita style without the basil leafs.,But the finishing touch and what takes it from normal to what people are talking about is this garlic and herb oil they have to paint over the slice.,My cousin told me about this as I would have otherwise probably just ignored it, but it takes the slice from great to 'I have lost the power of speech' in a very short amount of time.,It's just phenomenal.,The pepperoni slice is also good, but I'd say the nod goes to the cheese slice. .,Check it out!","Total sleeper, this place is da bomb! Xlnt deep dish and New York pizza! Don't forget the garlic knots, they are wowzer! Enjoy","All the food was very very good, I had to ask a couple of times to get my water filled as that's all I drink.,I needed the water as I had them add anchovies on my pizza.,When your having anchovies, water is super important ;-)  So for me the service was just OK. I'd go back for the food tho.","I've never gone here before, but they apparently have new management as of 4/22/16.,Everyone working there was friendly and one of the owners was particularly personable.,The kitchen is ran by an actual cook, not some teenager lacking sanitation sensibility.,I think he's from the East Coast and originally from Europe (not sure if it's Italy, Sicily or somewhere else). .,The food itself was very good.,They had a carryout special 16\" 2-Topping for $9. 95.,I got two of those, a Super Cheesesteak hoagie and a cannoli.,The pizza dough is flavorful with a good consistency and all the toppings were fresh.,It did not taste greasy at all despite the pepperoni and sausage.,I was also impressed with the Cheesesteak.,It tasted just as good as a Capriotti's sub.,I'll definitely go back there for another sub, if not another pizza.,As for the cannoli, the pastry part had a good crumble to it and the filling was near perfect - sweet, but not overpowering.,There's always a lot of options for pizza, Super Pizza is worth trying out. .,It doesn't lose a star for anything, I just need to go back to try other items on their menu like chicken wings and fingers.,If that checks out, it might be my go-to carryout place for Monday Night Football. .,Sidenote: The dining area is clean but its nothing fancy or special.,They don't serve beer or wine so it's not ideal for dining in.","After parking in the garage across from the Dodge Theater I followed the \"Restaurant/Bar Open\" sign to Crazy Jim's.,The \"bar\" part is a joke - it's a tiny counter right where you walk in the door, with about 4 stools.,The restaurant has no atmosphere and the food was just so-so.  .,There's quite a variety of offerings on the menu, including salads, pita wraps, subs, pizza, and entrees.,However, you will quickly notice that many of the items are exactly the same with one variation, i. e. two subs with chicken and onions but one has cheese and the other has jalapenos.,I asked if I could get the vegetable \"sub\" as a \"pita sub\" and was told that that just wouldn't work.,So I settled on one of the chicken pitas.   .,The pita itself was just fine, nothing special.,I expected more of a wrap but it was served open-face and couldn't be held together so I had to use a knife and fork.,The accompanying fries were disappointing - golden brown on the outside but hard/under-fried inside.  .,Bottom line: Crazy Jim's is lucky it pretty much has the monopoly of pre-concert eating/drinking within walking distance of the Dodge Theater.","OG's Original Geno's is a great neighborhood spot for Pizza and Beer!! The owners are there 80% of the time and my 10 year old is always happy when he leaves.,The bread and pizza is made fresh on site everyday you don't have to worry about it being old.,This place is also a great place to grab a beer and watch a game.","New to the area and was looking for some great pizza. . . . i found it!! Had a buffalo chicken with bacon and it was delicious! Nice, greasy, perfectly spicy and cheesy! This will be my weekly haunt for great pie!!","I have yet to eat here,  but next time I am out that way I will be sure to give their pizza a go.,The girl next to me was sure enjoying hers.,Their beer selection is excellent and the atmosphere and decorations inside would make it a great place for date night.","I had pizza from here my first night in Vegas around 2am.,The pizza was excellent but after that many drinks anything tastes good at 2am.,I decided to try it another time when I wasn't intoxicated and it was even better.,It was so good that I am ready to call it the best pizza I ever had.,I've been to Gramaldi's in Brooklyn, Lombardi's in Manhattan, Motorino in Brooklyn, Di Fara's in Brooklyn, John's on Bleeker Street, and Frank Pepe's. . . . but Five50 is #1.,By the way, Frank Pepe is 2nd.","Found out about this place on Instagram and saw that a special pizza was being brought back for a one day special by pre-order only, The Kracken.,I was intrigued by the black pizza dough and put in my order.,The toppings included white garlic sauce, crispy calamari, peppadew, manila clams, garden greens,  purple basil, mozzarella, and pecorino all on a squid ink laced dough. .,Upon first bite, I was hooked on the crispy calamari and wished that I had made a separate order.,The peppadew provided a sweet heat that complimented well with the purple basil and cheeses.,I wish there was more of the white garlic sauce as its flavor was masked by the toppings and did not come through.,Unfortunately after two bites of each slice I was left with a large squid ink bread stick topped with mozzarella.,Toppings were not generous in this case. .,Overall, this pizza was a good experience.,But to pay $17. 25 for this 12\" pizza just doesn't have me thrilled to come back for another.,The calamari is a completely different story.  .,Only 20 are available for pre-order and can be picked up on Thursday's.,Keep an eye out on their social media accounts to know when they release The Kracken once more!","I loved this place! If we go back to Vegas, we will definitely stop here.,It's small, but the food was good.,My fiance ordered the \"personal\" pizza, but it could have easily fed three of us!","I'm sad to write this review, because I'm actually obsessed with Caliente's Hawaiian pizza, but the service is so bad I feel that I can no longer give them my business! Every time I order I get the same thing-- and that's pretty frequent (don't judge) and every time I call and order they tell me it will be 45 minutes. . . . and every time it is late.,Last time, the woman who delivered it told me they dropped it and didn't want to give me a bad product-- ok fair.,But, why wouldn't you let me know that or give me some sort of discount since it was so late?,If that was the only time this sort of thing happened, I would give them a pass, but they are always late and the one time I went into the actual establishment the service was slow and inattentive as well.,Maybe it's a training problem. . . a hiring problem?.,Pros:. +Pizza is GOOD.

The time between the first entree being dropped (mine) and the last (pasta) was almost 25 minutes, and the time between our appetizers being cleared and my entree being dropped was over 20 minutes as well.,Now, we were in no rush as it's NYE, but we had sat and ordered by half 8 and were not out by 11, it was ridiculous. it was not even crowded and it is not the wait staff's fault.,The expo or someone in the kitchen was being a stone cold disaster (I used to work on a kitchen line, you know when the mess ups is from front or back of house). .,Since it had been about 40 minutes between cleared apps and my friend getting her pasta, they should have refired the rest of our entrees or at least kept them warm. no, they dropped one plate, then dropped two pizzas, and the pasta with 5ish minutes or so between each of those things.,It was baffling. the prospect of them firing up another shit meal for me after 40 minutes of not eating anything (rude to start eating until everyone has their plates when your party is only 4), i wasn't going to risk it i just wanted to dip ASAP and never return. .,It sucks too because the wait staff, ambiance, and the menu on paper are so awesome, and this place is like two blocks from where I live. further, the presentation is lways great, but the food underneath it absolutely blekh.,I don't see myself hemorrhaging my hard earned cash on this place ever again.,In a town with so, so many amazing culinary options i will never understand how the hell this place stays open in such a prime location. they need to elevate the quality of their food to justify the price, or hopefully they'll be gone by the end of the year. i've given it so many chances and Saturday was just the straw that broke the camel's back.","Just ordered and holy smokes I've never seen the delivery time like this one, 65 to 75 minutes. wow they need to step their game because this is becoming not worth the wait at all not to mention it's a hit or miss if the pizzas cooked good or not disappointed","I'd give it a solid 3 for the pizza slice lunch special, but my wife's egg salad sandwich was so good, I bumped it to a 4.","Stopped in for dinner on August 1, space at the bar and tables but they were doing a decent business because you can also buy pizza by the slice and it appeared you could get it for take out which was odd to see in a casino. .,Anyway, they have a great beer selection, about 13 taps of all varieties, some national brands but a lot of regional beers.,The salads are good portion sizes but the thing that I really enjoyed was what they called Pigs &amp; Truffles.,This was a shredded pork cannelloni on top of spinach in b\u00e9chamel sauce with some truffles on top.,The shredded pork in cannelloni was awesome, I love cannelloni but it usually comes with ground meats, not shredded.,The pork wasn't dry at all and had a nice texture to it.,The spinach had a bit of a peppery taste to it and it mixed very well with the creamy b\u00e9chamel sauce. .,The place has only been opened about two month and is buried back near the sports book at the aria but if you are there, give it a shot.","Grabbed takeout from Nook Kitchen during a business trip &amp; decided to order the Mushroom Pizza &amp; Beet salad.,Asked if they could make the salad veggie (since it came w/ bacon plus a bacon-vinaigrette &amp; they happily obliged.,Subbed the dressing for a blood orange balsamic which was a wonderful option.,The salad was mostly arugula - there were very few beets &amp; goat cheese dollops.,So for a standard salad this was okay but guess I'd been expecting thick slices of beets w/ just a little frisee.,The pizza was wood fired &amp; had a nice crisp crust.,Lots of mushrooms - decent but prob would look elsewhere for dinner in the future.,This was okay but would not consider it a destination spot when in the area","The  food was great , we had a Margharita pizza, the shrimp risotto and the braised pork chops with gnocchi!.,Unfortunately it is a very busy place so extremely noisy and waiters can take some time to bring your drinks/food. .,Worth to go for the food and low price, but would recommend for parties of 4+ that want more of a good place to start the party night than a cosy diner.","So thrilled that they finally opened up another location in none other than a perfect location in the Entertainment District (John and Richmond).,This location is bigger, has more seating space, and has two ovens so you can get more pizzas in and out a lot quicker.,We ordered the custom pizza for $12. 83 because we like the unlimited amount of toppings that you can put on it.,More bang for your buck and you can load up as much as you want!

You go to a SUSHI restaurant for \"rare\" fish! .,Needless to say- the plate came out &amp; it was a portion less than what you'd receive paying $50+ a plate at a 5 star establishment for \"gourmet\". . . the filet was less than 4oz on a 1/4 cup amount of rice.,Friend said the rice had 0 flavor.,The 5 sprigs of \"steamed\" asparagus was like chewing on wood (I heard the crunch over the loud music) &amp; the salmon was about the best part- but only the crust contained flavor while the rest flaked pretty bland.,And this was \"worth\" $17. .,We had high hopes in the unique 'Brussels &amp; Bacon' pizza I ordered.,I wanted the fish tacos- but they only are served as an appetizer.,Was not going to pay $12 for that then have to fork out an extra $2-3 for a side.,Make it a meal.,People who want tacos want more than a \"bite\".,And I'm from Alaska- so don't pass it off with price as 'Alaskan Cod' when we know cod is bottom of the barrel, even in Alaska, where salmon &amp; halibut are the true picks.,Nothing about cod makes it more special, and Alaska is offended you use it's name to price gouge mediocre fish we don't even claim to fame. .,The pizza did not disappoint.,Generous amount of Brussels.,But the bacon was pretty weak.,Corn was of plenty- I love corn- but paid for bacon on the pizza, not cheap corn as a filler.,Crust was on par &amp; pretty much made it, as overall, the flavor was a bit bland.,But, that is what happens when you skimp on the salted bacon that is supposed to round out the dish &amp; flavor. .,I passed on desert- but had a bite of the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e my friend ordered.,The waitress, while she was attentive &amp; tried very hard- could not remember which version of the desert was on the menu.,We were told it was supposed to be strawberry.,Thought it tasted funny &amp; was rather brown. . . to find out it was actually some rendition of a chocolate almond or something along the lines of what tasted \"burnt\", in my opinion.,I passed after one bite.,Friend was not too thrilled but ate it.,Waitress apologized- but I guess it was a little disappointing not being provided the correct menu when choosing &amp; spending was not the greatest way to end the experience. .,I would give it a second chance.,There are other items/beverages I would like to try that have piqued my interest.,And I really did enjoy the atmosphere &amp; close location- seems like there is more potential to be discovered.,And I will add- I sincerely appreciate a place that offers samples of their beers before having to order &amp; not know! Excellent in offering samples of their brews- and they also seem to have excellent knowledge.,I found it pretty cool to see a peek inside the brewery in the back upon entering/exiting on the side of the building where there are glass windows to the brew room.","Good bar around the corner for happy hour and sporting events.,I love when they combine the 4 TVs in the center into one large TV for football games.,We enjoy the wings and pizza, the cold beer and zipparitas (frozen margaritas that pack a punch, so there is a maximum amount you can order haha).","It surprises me what celebrity chefs are willing to put their name on.,Riva is a poolside (all outdoor) restaurant at The Venetian.,We went here for lunch and I was completely underwhelmed by the choices on the menu and by the food itself.,Really?,This is what a celebrity chef comes up with?,Sad. .,Very few choices so you better want a pizza, a club sandwich, or a standard salad.,That's it.,My daughter had the cheese pizza.,I had the club sandwich, which came with fries.,And I got a strawberry colada swirl. $60 later, we called that a lunch and left.,I could have gotten that anywhere.,Why on earth would that be what Wolfgang Puck offered up?,Seems crazy to me. .,If you want to overspend on something you can get better at your local diner. . . come here.","The place is supposed to be known for tacos.,But the tacos are average at best, and no better than what you could get your local Chili's or other commercialized Mexican joint (yes, I am aware that this is Latin American--not Mexican--food).,The biggest problem that I have is with the tortilla shell.,While most people like to fixate on the protein and the toppings (similar with sushi), it's the backbone of the dish (i. e. tortilla shell and sushi rice) that is most important.,And, it is clear that the tortilla shells simply came from a bag from some commercial plant--bland, chewy, gummy, and sad.,Once you've had a real, homemade tortilla shell, there is no going back.,I expected better from a place that has \"tacos\" in its name. .,Moving on the toppings, which I can only assume was meant to be the star of the show.,We tried 7 varieties: BBQ Pork, Rio Style Chicken, Chipotle Mushroom, Chicken Tinga, Roasted Pork Al Pastor, Chorizo &amp; Potato, and Lamb Barbacoa.,Some things I noted: the pork had been cooked to death with inadequate seasoning (lathering on sauce is not a remedy as I'm sure we all know from a pot roast blunder or two); the slaw on the al pastor was extremely wet and I had a mushy, wet taco in my hands by the time I got to it; it was unclear whether the slaw on the al pastor or lime crema on the lamb barbacoa had been tasted by anyone and adjusted for seasoning before it was served because the sour element was overwhelming and not balanced whatsover.  .,We also had the chicken empanadas as an appetizer.,First of all, they were not empanadas--the flaky half-moon pastries that we're all used too.,The waitress was spot on with her description:  they tasted and had the consistency of essentially pizza rolls.,So if you like pizza rolls, I guess they are fine. .,Finally, the hostess was terrible.,I approached her to request a table for 2 on a Sunday around 2:30 P.,M.,We then sat down at the high-top bar tables (where other people waiting for a seat were also sitting) at the spot closest to her and literally right in front of her.,We watched 4 other parties who had arrived after us be seated before we asked what was going on.,Turns out that she had crossed our names off the list because she thought we had gone to the bar.,No apology, just a blank stare. .,I didn't try any of the drinks and don't intend to. $8 for a Dark n' Stormy is amusing; that's halfway to an entire bottle of Gosling's rum, and then I could have endless Darn n' Stormys for a month. .,Authentic is definitely not the name of the game.,At the end of the day, you're basically paying for the modern decor, hip music, cute font on the menus, and a \"safe\" place to eat with your co-workers.,I'll stick with my $1-2 authentic tacos at Taco Bajaa Fresh over on Copley Drive on my own time though.","This is a relatively new restaurant, so I'm cutting some slack for a few things that are usually related to \"growing pains\" and will probably sort themselves out. .,Residents of East Mesa are eager to have some nice dining options and I think Osteria has potential.,We had the meatball appetizer (which was amazing) and the Pesto, Ravioli, bolognese, and salsiccia (mushroom pizza).,All the food was really good.,We did request a side of red sauce for the ravioli as it is not served with red sauce.,You can taste that the food is made from scratch and everything was really good.,The pizza could have used another minute to crisp the crust a bit more, but was flavorful and delicious.,The wine list is fairly good and the bread and EVOO is good.,We requested balsamic to go along with it and they accommodated our request.  .,The service on our second visit was better than the first.,I would request that the servers not refer to me as honey or sweetie.,Others might not overlook this as easily. .,I hope that Osteria will continue to work out the kinks.,This is a pricey restaurant for the east valley and although many EV residents are willing to pay for a nice dinner, they will expect great service and food.,I'm hoping that Osteria will expand their limited menu to include a few more seafood and meat selections.","Went to Greenhouse for lunch after getting a recommendation on facebook from Michael Symon.,We ordered the Siracha(sp?) wrap w/ chickpeas and the french bread pizza.,It was clear that Greenhouse uses seasonal and local ingredients, which accounts for the way their food tastes.,The veggie wrap was good, but lacked the spiciness I was expecting.,As far as vegetarian dishes go, I wasn't overly impressed.,The french bread pizza, however, stole the show.,The baguette it was baked on was crusty and fresh.,The cheese it was topped with was perfectly melted and the heirloom tomatoes on it were gorgeous as well as delicious.,I forgot to mention that the salads that accompanied these dishes were amazing.,Light, fresh &amp; with great dressing.,If I am in the area again, I will be curious to come back and see how the menu has changed!","Ok pizzaria in Dorval if you like a wimpy pizza, their dressing is very decent and flavor wise its eatable.,They also habe pretty good prices compared to others in the area.","One thing I really love about Cibo is their Pizza Happy Hour, 3-5pm weekdays. .,If you are keen on an early dinner, and tight in the budget department, this can make for a excellent/thrifty start to any evening or date. .,They have a happy hour menu which features a selection of more stripped-down offerings of some of their standard pizzas, each one for only $5.,FIVE. BUCKS. That's the cost of a cardboard disc with melted Ken &amp; Barbie dolls from Little Caesar's, for cryin' out loud! .,It is a KILLER deal considering the deliciousness of their pizza.,Their website boasts, \"the best pizza crust in the city, \" and I have to admit, it is quite good.,Thin, but not to thin; chewy, but not too chewy; delightfully greasy, but not too greasy. .,They also offer drink specials like a $5, 5 oz.,Valpolicella.,Not bad. .,The interior is tastefully decorated, nice and cozy. .,The service is very friendly.,Even accommodating to the cabalone that wanders in in 15 minutes before 5:00 hoping to still catch happy hour.,Just be sure to tip a little extra if you're getting a good deal during happy hour.,That delicious pizza would normally cost upwards of $15, so don't let your good fortune be your kind server's loss!","I wanna like this place more.,Fairly priced, good (not great tho) pizza.,But the delivery times are sooo bad.,Worst I've ever experienced anywhere.,They are always and forever late.,And for the life of me, I can't understand why they can't keep up.,Every other pizza place can have it all done and delivered in an hour.,I've even ordered sandwiches and waited for more than an hour and a half! How is the bad delivery the only thing consistent??,Fix it!","Delicious again. .,We always order the Fritto Misto + side of their housemade marinara. .,This mixture of calamari &amp; rock shrimp is delicious and the marinara is IMHO much better for dipping than the sauce that comes with the dish.   .,This time we ordered the 14\" original crust Classic European pizza add meatball (DO THIS!).,Turns out meatball was a fantastic choice and really augmented the rich flavor of this already-delicious pizza.  .,We also ordered the 12\" thin crust Wood Fired Yukon Gold + egg pizza to try something new.,It was good but I'd like it better if the whole thing had egg on it instead of just the center.,Kind of reminded us of breakfast.,Glad we tried it but will probably go back to our favorite Pavone Pepperoni again next time. .,One daughter ordered an 8\" Pesto Bianca pizza as well.,She let me have a piece and I'll say it was really, really good.,That pesto and the sundried tomato they put on there is really tasty!   I'd order this again but watch out for those nut allergies - the pesto is walnut based.  .,Another satisfying visit to Nello's!","Oh no, Joe! .,Here's the problem:. 1.,You need to do something about the ridiculous line out the door.,Yes, you are popular.,Yes it was dinner time (on a Thursday night. ) So why was there only one person taking orders?,You have two registers.,Heard numerous complaints during my 30 minute wait. . 2.  if someone orders the havarti pesto burger, please include the pesto.  even if the person orders it without the bun.,You could put it in a condiment cup. . 3.,When you're making kids food, please be aware that kids are some of the pickiest diners out there and unhappy kids = unhappy parents.,The kids grilled cheese came out with some red sauce on the cheese part.  not just a little.,Therefore kids refused to eat.,Perhaps it was pizza sauce?,BBQ sauce?,Whatever it was, it shouldn't have been there.,That's $10 down the drain.,Yes, two kids meals which were 1/2 a grilled cheese sandwich each were $5.,And, mommy, who went out to avoid having to cook after a long day had to go home and prepare something. . 4.,What's the story with the flies?,Well, of course they are expected at an outdoor place, but our table was literally swarming with them.,I noticed that the tables under the trees did not have patrons vigorously swatting these pesky creatures away.,This isn't really a complaint, just a heads up to future guests to suss out the tables before you sit down. . 5.,What do you do best?,I want to give you one more chance as my mom's group loves to 'lunch' here, but I just haven't discovered the magical menu item.,My husband said he's come for the last time, so I'm on my own.,I've had the sandwiches and pizzas and nothing stands out.  .,A couple positives to end my review:.,When I went back in to get my pesto, the guy who got it for me was super friendly. .,Food comes out quickly once it's ordered. .,Cool bathroom. .,One final piece of advice - sit on the side away from the street.,We learned this the hard way as it was a nuisance to continuously walk around the building for drink refills, taking kids to the bathroom, utensils, condiments, picking up food, etc.","YAY - Pittsburghers rejoice!  Finally a place to replace Pizza Sola/NY style in Pittsburgh. .,We stopped in on a random Wednesday at around 3PM to try them out and grab a quick slice.,We ordered a basic pepperoni which was really good.,Is it the best pizza I've ever had in my life?,No.  Is it high on my list of a basically non-existent NY style market in Pittsburgh?,Absolutely.,The service was great, chill guys working hard that really want to see the place succeed.,I will happily be back (probably at least once a week) to continue to support them!.,Pro-tip: Don't be dissuaded by the $5ish slice prices, these slices are HUGE and totally worth it.","Had a child's birthday party there yesterday, wonderful facility, clean environment, great DJ spinning tunes, and the staff was quite attentive and kept each party moving along.,The pizza was good and hot, pitchers of lemonade on the table was never empty!","I ordered the Salsiccia, but replaced the mushrooms with roasted peppers.,It was exceptional. .,My wife ordered the Contradina with sausage.,She loved it. .,Nutella pizza was good, but by the time it made it to the table, it was cold. . .  .,Focaccia bread with olive oil was good, but a bit bland. .,It's a bit pricy for a small pizza, but you can't get 90 second pizza like this in many places.,It's well worth a look in the Madison area.","Best woodfire pizza in CU so far!!! Excellent service and always piping hot, made to eat.","Visited this place for dinner tonight. . . . .,NY Pizza gets 4 stars because they are true to their name.,The pizza is exactly as what we have in NY.

We havent been there in about a 1. 5 and decided since we used to go there frequenty- we would go back w/ my Dad in town.,Walked in, the decor and the ambiance went from what used to be cool, chic, edgy- to lame calm restaurant.,The waiter had no personality- I asked him \"Is the place still as good as it used to be?\" his resonse -walked away.,OK. .,Now onto the food. . .,Ordered oysters and another appetizer (lobster poutine which was DELISH) and 2 main dishes.,They served us everything together! REALLY?! What happened to apps come first then dinner? .,Best part was we had a variety of oysters- the ones from BC ended up being super fishy.,The waiter replied \" Oh yes i HATE those too\".,So why not tell us that before we ordered them?! Thanks a lot for nothing! .,The gnocchi in a meat sauce was absolutly disgusting- it was like chineese beef dish sauce and a few random tiny gnocci floating around.  .,Sad to say if your a real foodie like we are- who go out multiple times a week. . avoid this place. .,Came home and ordered a pizza!  Sorry Chuck- shame.","Best pizza in Madison!

One dish is better than the next! .,The wine selection is impressive, the restaurant is beautiful with a great ambiance, and the service is outstanding! .,This is a must for anyone looking for a great meal with lots of variety, yet without overdoing it. .,There is a very cool private room in the back that can be reserved for small events and the finger foods served are delicious! .,Great for groups of friends, wine tasting, hanging out after an event.","In searching for someplace new to eat in Vegas, Grimaldi's came up and had pretty good reviews.,So, based on the featured \"coal-burning\" oven, it was a must-try. .,The place is a pretty cool retro-modern looking, table-and-chair, checkered tablecloth, cloth napkin eatery with available(? we weren't asked if we wanted to sit outside) al fresco seating, open kitchen, and full-service? bar.,I liked the \"renewable\" wine bottle chande-lights. .,For the three of us, we ordered a Large Pepperoni and Italian Sausage pizza, a Personal Mushroom pizza, and the Antipasto, which I HAD TO TRY because of the \"house-made\" Fresh Mozzarella.,The Pepperoni and Italian Sausage pizza was pretty good.,Good sauce, adequate amount of topping, and a crisp crust, although it did have a somewhat disturbing amount of char on the bottom of it.,The mushroom pizza, in my opinion, was a bit scant on one of the most inexpensive of toppings.,The Antipasto was quite good, consisting of olives,  oven-roasted red peppers, Genoa salami, fresh mozzarella, and sliced bread.,The winner on that plate was the \"house-made\" fresh mozzarella, with the sweet oven-roasted red peppers making a good accompaniment on the sliced bread with the salami and cheese.,Oh, and a splash of olive oil and balsamic vinegar (from the leaky bottle)! .,The service could use some work, as our waiter was kinda lost.,First, messing up a simple one diet coke, one regular coke, one iced tea order, bringing two regular cokes instead and blaming it on the dispenser.,Whuh?,And nowhere to be found when we were ready to pay our check.,He also screwed up our neighboring tables' pizza order, leaving one of three women sitting there watching her friends eat their pizza while hers was re-ordered.,And I don't think they put a rush on it.,Having back-of-the-house experience, her order should have been re-made \"on-the-fly\", meaning  it should have been made top priority. .,Aside from the little snags, I would definitely go back to try the Caprese salad and some other pizza combinations.","We did take out.,Easy ordering, interesting menu.,Ordered the Cauliflower pizza good but a little bland crust was great, hubby had Paul and Young Ron pizza tasty, and house salad, lettuce was crisp dressing was yummy.,We'll have to try again. .","I'm not sure why this place doesn't have at least four stars --- we had the caprese salad and the potato pizza and it was amazing!

Definitely consider sharing between 2-3 people though because it is pretty big - I ate half and then thought I was about to fall into a food coma.,Price is also reasonable at $18 I think, especially if you split with a few people! .,Also big ups to the service, because the waitress who served us last night was super nice and friendly and added to the good dining experience :).,Overall 4-stars for this restaurant because some dishes are just okay. . . but duck poutine pizza is a must!","I absolutely love this place.,Allll the pizza here is phenomenal.,You can't go wrong with any veggie pizza here. :))) great customer service and very attentive.  .,I LOVE THEIR ROLLS. :)","This is my favorite Rosati's location as you can dine in and the pizza is SOOOO much better fresh from the oven!!  I have only ordered the thin crust and probably will never venture elsewhere on the menu because it's so dang good!!

The wait time has never been quick, but I've also never become irritated by the wait. . . maybe 30 minutes or so. .,Even though CPK isn't as exciting as a local, hole-in-the-wall type pizza place, they consistently deliver good food with descent service at a moderate price.,And since I like consistency, and am dreaming of their pizza right now, I give them 4 stars!","Best pizza in las vegas for sure.,I thought it was quite phenomenal for the location and ready it is.","My husband and I got married in Vegas 9/29/12, and though our wedding was not at the Plaza, we decided that we would reserve a block of rooms for our guests here, as well as book a mini suite for ourselves.,Let me start by saying the casino, lobby, and rooms were all very nice.,I had never stayed at the Plaza prior to this, I don't think I have ever even been inside, but I had heard that they just did the renovation, and heard it was nice, so we went with it.,I couldn't decide to give the Plaza 4 stars or 3 stars, based solely on the group reservation department, which is where the hotel missed the 5 star mark for me.,Even the rude girl at the check in desk wouldn't have made this hotel lose a star, as I didn't personally experience her, however SEVERAL of my guests did.,I felt that the customer service from the group sales department left much to be desired.,They didn't get back to me, didn't answer questions - I asked the same question to 2 girls that work there, and after 5 days of no response back from either one, I finally called the manager, and all of a sudden one of the girls called me back within an hour of me leaving the message for the manager, however I still wish the manager would have contacted me back, as I was pretty much done dealing with the girls at that point.,I also was pretty surprised to find out that a block of rooms can mean anywhere in the hotel, which sucked that some of our guests were in north tower, some in south tower, and everyone was on different floors from one another.,I thought the whole reason we booked it all so far in advance was to have a block of rooms together, at least in the same tower if it couldn't be on the same floor.,The lobby of the hotel was really nice, the mcdonalds is open 24 hours, which is nice, the hash house a go go was really really good - we tried to go Saturday morning, but there was over an hour wait, so we ended up going Monday morning, and it wasn't even crowded at all.,My parents stayed at the Golden Nugget, and when my dad came over to our room, he was impressed by how big and nice it was.,The mini suite had a mini bar, and it was nice to have the fridge in the room.,Also, when you book a group reservation, the resort fee is waived, so we were able to access the internet and stuff for no extra charge.,I didn't use the parking garage that everyone complains about in other reviews, the south tower is right by the valet, so we used the valet service our entire stay.,I also like that they have a security guard stationed at the base of each tower, and you have to show a room key to access the elevators.,Overall, I would say our stay was great, we had a great time, and I felt the rooms were pretty nice.,Also, there is a lounge called the drink, and we hung out there one night, it was pretty fun, shots for 25 cents every hour on the hour.,Only other negative thing was that we brought a babysitter for the wedding night, and when they checked out, they left my kids shoes in the room, when we went to lost and found, they hadn't processed everything that was left over the weekend, and told me to call back the following day.,My husbands mom, sister, and aunt also forgot all the clothes hanging in the closet, which included what they wore to our wedding, and lost and found didn't have those items or my kids shoes - so that was kind of disappointing to lose all those items.,Oh yeah, we also got a pizza from pop up pizza, and it was really good.,My husband wanted to order another one for the road before we left, lol.,Also, we went to exposed salon (already reviewed them on yelp) and got our hair and make up done prior to the wedding, and I would recommend those girls to everyone, they did a fantastic job.,I decided to go with 4 stars, the plaza really did a great job, and though I would never book a group there again, my husband and I may consider a stay there in the future","I came here for the first time earlier this week and thought it was a good spot for a date or dinner out with friends.,The staff was friendly, the food was ok, and the wine selection was good.,I'm sure I'll be back again. .,Wine: Albari\u00f1o (yum).,Apps: The beet dish and the tuna dish were both quite good, though nothing especially memorable.,I appreciated that the tuna dish was not too salty, which is rare to find in this city. .,Pizza Margherita: I was disappointed with the quality of the pizza considering that they have a proper pizza oven.,The dough itself was thicker than it should be and lacked the airy quality of true italian style pizza.,The sauce was descent and the mozzarella they used was very good.,The one thing I couldn't understand the were the slices of beefsteak tomatoes on top of the pizza. . . very odd.","The only reason why four stars and not five because we didn't try the pizza yet. .,The items we did try were; garlic bread knots, minestrone soup, cheese ravioli in alfredo sauce, spaghetti and meatballs, and cheese cake. .,All was fabulous and the service was very good too!","This place is really adorable.,We had originally gone to the sister restaurant for \"pizza\", which they didn't have.,We're so glad, because, for the price, you really can't beat this place.,The pizza is PERFECT, not too thin (I'm sorry my idea of pizza is not phyllo dough with some mozzarella splattered here and there) and not too thick (a moment on the lips, a lifetime on these freakin hips!).,My husband is Italian &amp; has grown up with an Italian mom making homemade pizza his whole life, he was very impressed.,Quality mozzarella, homemade tomato sauce with the right amount of herbs.,The Caesar salad was well done, the right amount of dressing, I could taste anchovies but not overwhelmingly so, and the lettuce was crisp &amp; fresh.,My only suggestion - add some garlicky croutons.,This is the best part, though.,If you have kids, there is a\"VIP\" room for them, complete with cartoons and video games, amazing!

Go upstairs and check out their game room too.,Great fun and flashbacks.","Ordered for delivery and was told to expect a 40 minute wait, after an hour and a half our cold pizza's arrived. .,The meat lovers pizza contained tasteless greasy Italian sausage, soggy pepperoni, and cold crusty ham slices in extremely sparing amounts. .,The grilled steak chipotle pizza came completely without sauce.,Nothing better than a cold dry pizza. .,Would not recommend to my worst enemies.","I had free delivery from Postmates and decided to try.,I ordered the veggie ranch pizza thin crust no broccoli sub artichoke and was so good! (If you love veggies) I asked for ranch on side that I didn't receive but I don't even care because the pizza was so flavorful without!","I don't know what the hype is about - I tried the Fetalicious pizza, and while it was *good* and I *enjoy feta cheese very much* I did not have dreams of  nor cravings for this pizza.,Perhaps if I'd had it with thin crust instead. . .","Looking for the perfect thin crust pizza?,Well if you like homemade mozzarella then try out Upper Crust Pizza and Wine Bar.,Our friends introduced us to this restaurant on a recent visit to Scottsdale.,This restaurant is situated in a strip mall and doesn't look like anything special from the outside but take a step inside and you'll feel differently.,It has that \"cozy\" feeling that makes you want to keep coming back. .,They make a variety of homemade pizzas to order that come out of the oven with just the right amount of \"crispness\".,On my short trip to Scottsdale I made 2 visits to Upper Crust. (We just liked it so much the first time I couldn't wait to go back).,In addition to pizza they feature calzone and pasta on the menu.,It's a casual place that's big on \"atmosphere\".,On both visits we were lucky enough to have \"Laura\" wait on us.,She was personable and made our experience very enjoyable. .,Pizza sizes tend to be larger than what you would expect.,The \"personal size\" pizza was plenty to eat for my party of 2.,If you're a wine lover my tip would be to make a visit on a Wednesday night.,All bottles of wine are half off!","I was really excited to try Destihl, but unfortunately the experience fell a little flat.,My friend and I arrived a little after 7 on a Friday night and was told the wait would be about 40 minutes since we didn't have reservations.,No problem.,After only about 20-25 minutes our pager buzzed, so score! So far so good.,Our server was really nice and attentive, nothing negative to say about him.,However, the food is another story. .,We started with the cheese curds for an appetizer.,And these were awesome, plus they give you a lot.,The only part of the meal that really stood out, sadly.,I'd had my eye on the strawberry goat cheese salad, so I got that and split the pesto goat cheese pizza.,The salad had a lot of potential with all the seemingly good ingredients, but was just off.,The spinach tasted wrong and it would have been much better with mixed greens.,The \"strawberry\" part of the salad consisted of maybe three tiny pieces and the goat cheese wasn't even very good.,It mainly was made up of mandarin oranges and ill-tasting spinach. .,I'm not a huge fan of wood-fired pizza (I prefer almost any other type of crust).,My friend and I split a pizza, but I saw plenty of people putting one away all by themselves.,It is very thin.,The toppings were ok, but I didn't like how the goat cheese was in big globs instead of spread over the whole pizza. .,We left without getting dessert, but I saw a few and they are possibly the biggest desserts I've ever seen anywhere.,This isn't a good thing.,Probably 3-4 people should be splitting on dessert, but I'm guessing that doesn't happen that often.,So just be aware if you do order that piece of cake. .,Besides the service, the other positive is the price.,Everything is fairly cheap.,But that coincides with the quality, so just beware.","This is my second visit to Urban Tea Loft and I know many people absolutely LOVE this place.,I'm just so-so.,Our party of 12 truly enjoyed the delicious bruschetta, the cool crisp salads with yummy bacon, and the ultra-delicious, oh-so-incredible desserts.,I'm talking chocolate peanut butter mousse cake, carrot cake, chocolate banana cake, red-velvet cake and on and on.,Skip the veggie pizza and the pastas.,Oh, and don't get your hopes up until you ask if they are out of the catfish! Overall, the service was pretty bad.,Our server was confused and forgot our orders; some of us got extra tea that we didn't order and some of us never got refills; they were out of 4 or 5 major items on the menu (it was a Thursday evening) and at the end of dinner we had to go through our orders again because of a misplaced tab.,Three of our small plates were seriously dirty with leftover food on them.,Ick.,We all agreed this place was okay, but could use some more help.","Not only is the pizza awesome but so are the wings! The salads and cheese bread and everything else we've had here we have always enjoyed! We continue to go back because the food is always great and the service is always awesome.,We recommend this place!","This is best restaurant I've been to in AZ! We are from California and come a few times a year, every time we are here we have to eat at Oreganos! Employees here are so friendly and the food is delicious!! Great atmosphere too! I recommend the Pablo Picasso salad and the deep dish pizza  but everything I've tried has not disappointed!","Came here on Saturday night there was a line of people waiting to be seated but we had reservations so we're promptly seated.,Started with the carpaccio and the burrata board, both were very good and great portions.,I ordered the pesto chicken pizza with jalape\u00f1os and the hubby had veal piccata with the fried gnocchi.,The pizza was great but I have to admit my husbands dish was amazing.,I'm pretty sure it was the fried gnocchi that just took it over the top!!! Dessert however was a huge disappointment we had the zeppole which was fried phyllo dough that was extremely greasy and somewhat undercooked.,I'm definitely going back but staying away from the dessert! . . .,Wow what a difference when you do take out! We ordered the bruschetta which was fine but the burrata board was anything but. . . . it was literally less than half the size of the one we ordered when we sat down for dinner.,If I'm paying the same price as if we were to sit down why am I only getting a portion of the food?!

And not too many of those, either.,Instead of chiffonaded basil, or chopped basil, sprinkled across the pie, one large leaf was placed in the middle of each slice.,I had to tear each leaf into pieces by hand in order to properly distribute them across each piece so I could get that wonderful basil flavor in each bite.,The sauce was bland, more sweet like Oreganos rather than a real Italian taste.,The crust was okay.,Upon a return to Westgate Entertainment Center we'll be looking for another place to spend our food dollars.","Marathon Diner may not look fancy, but I had the best airport meal of my life here!  Skip the long line at McDonald's and head to Marathon for authentic, fresh, made-to-order Greek diner food. .,The veggie gyro ($10) was filled with peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes, lettuce, and feta cheese.,So good, and I almost feel like it was healthy?!  The guy working at the griddle (possibly the owner?) was really nice about asking whether I wanted banana peppers, cheese, etc. , so I'm sure they would accommodate special requests.,I love that Marathon offers a tasty and satisfying vegetarian option, because the cheese pizza slices at Villa just looked sad! .,Obviously I was just here for dinner, but Marathon Diner serves breakfast too!  Definitely stop here if you are hungry in the Pittsburgh airport.,You can really tell that they put a lot of love into the food!","For three days in a row I was literally fed in this restaurant as part of all day training sessions.,It is a pity the resto is located in a hotel and in general it will be ignored by the population of Montreal.,Food was really nice.,Fresh salads, deliciously looking french fries that made me jealous as I didn't pick a dish including them, huge portion of very well prepared pasta with sausage and shrimp.,The pizza I had the last day was relatively good for a non pizza place, but huge.,We left so much food behind that I still feel guilty.,Service was friendly and very well organized.,The room is designed in french bistro style and it is bright, and inviting.,It is not cheap if you are there on your own, still a nice option for a good meal in the area.","Excellent pizza and reasonable for LV.

I'm gonna be so sad when I go back to California and can't have it:(","The staff is so incredibly nice! The restaurant was clean and up to date.,The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because the pizza sauce was a little on the sweet side (something I am not used to) but it was interesting to try! Other than that it was a great experience, the Antonio's Special Salad was great!","Heist is amazing! I came here with a group of friends and we all ordered different things, because it was nearly impossible to pick one thing.,When the food came out everything looked so unique and creative.,I couldn't pick a favorite, but the lobster bisque is awesome, and you can pick any of the flatbread pizzas and you will be very pleased.,Aside from beer, they had homemade soda's.,We got black cherry and cream, which were really, really good.,Overall we had a great night and I can't wait to come back for lunch :)","A large pizza with Sausage (more like pepperoni), mushroom and green peppers for 30$????,Are you kidding me?","Sooo the name may not seem too appealing.,Is their signature drink called a \"Tetanus Shot\"?,No, not quite - I actually don't know if they have one or not.,But they do make their own Sour Mix, Bloody Mary Mix and simple syrup.,Maybe the Pine Fin???.,Once inside though, any preconceived notions of this Tavern/Sports Bar will be gone.,The d\u00e9cor is really nice - lots of dark burly, manly wood and a copper footrest at the bar.,A couple of enormous flat screen TVs. Tons of seating indoors and out. .,We came here for a little day drinking (it's a real hobby - look it up).,There's plenty on tap and in bottle, including seasonal brews from Birdsong and Triple C. .,My friends ordered a bottle of Piper Sonoma knowing that it wasn't cold yet.,The bartender worked her magic, with a huge tub of ice, some salt and about 10-15 minutes. .,So a short visit - didn't get to try their food yet (blame it on Cripsy Bahn Mi-hehe) - even though appetizers and pizzas are are half price weekday afternoons (3-6 PM). There's always next time. .,Good place to get a drink by Southpark!","Moved to the area recently and was looking for good, local pizza.,Tried this place out.,Family owned, which I like, but the service seemed to lack enthusiasm.,The single large pizza I ordered was prepared in a reasonable amount of time and I took it home.,It was plenty hot when I returned home, and that's great.,The problem is. . it wasn't very good.,The sauce was dull, the crust struck me as generic, and the quality of toppings didn't blow my mind.,I'd put it on par with Papa John's, and  that's not necessarily a compliment.","Gotta love this place. . they make the pizzas as expected all the time! Also the customer service js good :)","Really amazing pizza, and a great team of people.,I ordered online, and somehow Sal's received a different order than the one I placed (they showed me what had come up on their order screen).,I didn't have my phone with me to show them what I had actually ordered, but they were incredibly nice about it, and made a whole new pizza to correct the order.,To top it off, the pizza was incredible! Will definitely be going back!","I guess if you are truly desperate than this will serve a purpose.,Just don't keep your expectations high. .,We had guests in town and they were gambling it up in the D and didn't want to leave.,We just wanted to sneak away and slam dunk something quick so we weren't hungry.,So, in that sense, it served its purpose. .,We got the 5. 99 \"special\" of 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink.,The pizza was obviously microwaved and very much like \"Michaelina\" type \"pizza\" you would buy in a grocery store.,I mean. .,I held it down, but it was nothing special.,The drink was pretty pitiful too. . . probably around the 12- 16 oz variety. .,Plus, how can you serve food and NOT have a public restroom?,Isn't that a violation of some sort???,Seriously?.,If you insist on eating here, just know what you're getting into. . . . 2 stars.","Grab a pizza here, grab a beer next door, and enjoy the weather on either place's patio.,I love the simplicity of the items here.,Both the Margherita and the Fire and Brimstone are delicious, but beware that the latter has some kick to it! The weekly special was also scrumptious, though unusual.,I've never thought to put pistachio on a pizza, but it definitely works.,I've heard the weekly special tends to push the boundaries on pizza toppings; I think it's great that the chefs have a creative outlet while keeping the regular menu tried and true.,Definitely get some dessert before you leave.,The chocolate chip and butterscotch pizookies are winners.,I'll be back to try the s'mores nachos :)","VERDICT: Come for the delicious bread, leave for the atmosphere. .,I really like Great Harvest Bread Co.  They do regular sliced bread a service, by making it fresh, preservative free and delicious.,The difference between Great Harvest Bread and Panera is dramatic.,Great Harvest shies away from croissants and danishes.,Instead they focus on white, wheat, and various other basic sliced breads.,They are really good though.,It really makes you detest going back to the normal grocery store fodder.,The downfall, as is with quality, is the price, about $5-$6 per loaf.,They also have cookies and a few bready desserts. .,Part deux of this review really has to focus on the experience and atmosphere.,First, I was really excited to find a Great Harvest over by my Costco on Decatur.,I forced Greg to pull over and rush in.,However, there was a group of six or so teenage n'er-do-wells also approaching the store at the same time.,I was determined to get to the store before them and told Greg to hurry or they were going to beat us to the door.,He said, \"don't worry, they'll eat up the free samples and you'll get a fresh loaf to sample\".,He just said that because he is a lollygagger and hates to \"pick up the pace\".,I must be getting old since I've already used the terms \"n'er-do-well\" and \"lollygagger\" in this post.,Anyway, I let the hooligans beat me to the store. .,Inside the narrow store, the teenagers turned out to be less of a threat.,It appeared to be closeted gay boys with their Christian-youth-group-approved girlfriends out having a wild time by venturing to the bread store to get a couple of sandwiches and get an inappropriate amount of free samples.,You know, basically being complete rebels.,They were kind of too outwardly excited about their bread samples in a wholesome way, saying things like \"I love bread\" and \"bread rocks\".,It was like those Totino pizza roll ads where the kids wax feverishly about their love of frozen food. .,This process actually took a long time, giving me an ample amount of time to give Greg the I-told-you-so eye for being a lollygagger.,Something I'm sure he was oblivious to noticing.,During this time, I was also able to look around at all of the customers sitting at tables.,There were quite a few of them.,I would say at least ten people scattered through the sitting area.,Then it struck me as being incredibly odd.,Every single person was facing the counter.,Every single person was not eating, drinking, or talking.,They were just staring at the counter.,I felt this existential feeling like I was starring in Sartre's \"No Exit\".,They were the audience and I didn't know that I was in the play.,It was bizarre.,I know, I know, I often accuse restaurants of being cults, as in crEATe and the nearby Salad Creations, but I think I'm on to something.,It was odd.,I have no idea what is going on there. .,In any case, I get the counter with my Dakota wheat bread (sooooo gooood).,I get my choice of free samples and the girl behind the counter offered me the heel of the bread.,Those n'er-do-well, hooligan, gays and their beards stole my chance for a decent sample.,And Greg's lollygagging didn't help either.","My boyfriend and I love this place.,We have never had anything bad on the menu.,Everyone is always friendly, that staff is always pleasant and attentive to us, we never have to ask for anything and always are satisfied completely when we leave.,The eggplant pizza is a must have, along with the peppers and ribs.,Recently tried the philly cheese steak pizza, which was pretty good, again no disappointments.,Recently went to Bella Luna and Anthony's just blows all pizza places out of the water in the Monroeville area as far as Coal Fired or Wood Fired oven pizza goes.,Anthony's really meets up to the upscale pizza parlor for an excellent dining experience.,Definitely a must try, you will not be disappointed.,Just caution PIZZA IS OVERDONE, which is a plus and also achieves that perfect coal fired oven taste.","Tried Pizza Fire for the first time tonight and loved it! Purchased two pizzas to go and chose a variety of toppings.,All very yummy! My niece tried the margherita and devoured it.,Our family will definitely return again and again! It's great to have local pizza that doesn't taste greasy or overly processed like most chains do.,Crust has a great texture and the flavors are exactly what you'd want from a fresh pizza.,Worth the visit!","There are 3 top pizza places in Las Vegas and this is one of them.,When you walk in it feels like a New York pizza place even the booths remind me of the ones in some of the best fast service style joints in NYC. They have a 30 inch pizza! That's as wide as a standard door! And the price is great too.,Lost a star (would only be half a star if I could) for the chicken philly cheese steak that was a little dry and burnt bun.,Their pizza will is way above average though.","We've been regular customers since they first opened.,As as fans of Pizzeria  Bianca and Grazzie, but not always up for the drive, we are entirely satisfied with the pizzas here.,Friendly atmosphere and consistent quality are hallmarks.,Service can be a little uneven, but they always manage to pull it off under Maria's watchful eye.,Highly recommended.","A fairly decent Asian style restaurant at the airport.,Slightly less expensive than the nearby options in the A20 concourse area.,We had a couple of items and they were tasty.,The egg rolls, while delicious, were swimming in grease.,One note of caution, they aren't the fastest place, so if you have a tight connection and there's a line, it may be tight.,Otherwise, give this place a try.  definitely better than the pizza place next door.","First time ever . .,Staff are very friendly and the place it's clean . . . my recommendation will be the Italian panini or pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms","The service was fast.,Great pizza.,However, as someone with a shellfish allergy, I find it frustrating that this is yet another restaurant where cross-contamination is apparently an issue to the point where everything is grilled together, fried together, and so on.","I love the South Point.,The Steakhouse is amazing.,It would get 5 stars if I was only rating the steakhouse.,Best Lobster bisque I've EVER had.,And the short rib and prawn combo was amazing.,The Buffet is ok-first time we went to the Sunday Buffet it was Father's Day and I was disappointed but after a second trip (thank you Michael Kennedy) we received vip treatment and comped drinks which showed us the SP cares about its guests.,Lotts of Asian/Mexican and good mashed potatoes and gravy.,The shrimp were nice and fresh and my 3 year old loved the pizza.","I have been going to the Essence of Unionville for approx. 7 years now.,It has easily become our favourite place for Sunday brunch with family/and or friends.,The service is exceptional as is the food selection.,Once you are seated you are offered complimentary flute of orange juice.,They have many breakfast favourites such as eggs benedict, sausage, bacon, made to order omelet station.,The selection is great! Prime rib, 3-4 different entrees, fresh vegetables, roasted potatoes, several salads to choose from, fresh in house made sushi, crab legs, shrimp, mussels, smoked salmon, antipasto - the list goes on!.,The desserts are out of this world and made in house by their very own pastry chef! Large selection of fruit, mousses, cakes, creme brulee (one of the best i've had!). .,I was just there last Sunday for brunch with my hubby.,There was an item i couldn't eat due to an allergy issue.,One of the chefs offered to make me a plate so that it wouldn't include the item i was allergic to and personally brought it to our table for me, The servers are so nice, friendly and often come over to ask how everything is, topping up drinks, clearing plates away so often that you don't even have to ask! They always remember a face they've seen before, so we often get a server that we've had on a previous visit and they will remember what we like to drink whether its a soft drink with our meal or cappuccino with dessert.,It is always super busy, but the service &amp; food is always top notch. .,We've tried 2-3 places along Highway 7 for brunch and this has remained at the top of our list! If i had to choose 1 thing that i didn't like, it would be that they don't have a kid friendly menu for kids 8 &amp; under.,Considering the fact that they are in a hotel where families do stay, it would be nice to see a couple of items (mini pizzas, tenders &amp; fries, pasta, waffles, pancakes?) for kids.,Price for adults is $38. 50 and $20 for kids.  .,They offer special brunches for Mother's Day, Christmas Day (weekday brunch is offered during the holidays in December), Easter (egg hunt for the kids!), New Years Eve &amp; New Years Day to name a few :)","Sometimes I feel like I spend way too much time here but its only because Riddle room is such a great place to be with friends.,I always find a new board game to play each time I go and the staff are always there to teach the rules and get the game going.,One of my favorite parts of the cafe is their great selection of video games from old school N64 to the newest Wii consoles. . . you'll always find people having a Super Smash brawl going on or racing along Rainbow Road! They definitely offer things that other board game cafes in Toronto don't have! .,The escape rooms are also the best I've been to in town.,Everything is so well set up and challenging that you really get to experience the fun of escape rooms.,I've already played 3 of the 4 rooms at RR and managed to get 3rd best time for their Anatomy Room with my friends!

It is super tempting. .,Appetizers, both the breaded and grilled calamari is as you would expect which is good but not spectacular.,Their Caesar Salad comes with fresh and crisp lettuce and is great to start with.,I hate it when restaurants drench their salads in dressing and luckily they have never done this to me here. .,For those who like veal, I've had the veal in peppercorn sauce, veal parmigiano, and the veal marsala.,They are all tasty and filling with a stressor on filling.,Make sure you're hungry or you're taking some home.,The grilled salmon is my daughter's favourite dish.,The fish is always cooked perfectly and the rice is a flavourful accompaniment. .,Their pizzas are just the way I like it, think crust, light on the sauce with plenty of imaginative toppings.,The Chiffonade and Bacon pizza is a great departure from the usual.,The spinach pairs well with the salty bacon fontina and provolone cheeses.,No tomato sauce on this one, so perfect for those who do not love sauce on their pizza all the time.,The Puttanesca Pizza is our second favourite that is a great explosion of vegetarian flavour.","Great place for any kind of craving you're having - from pizza to pasta to wings - they have it and it's good! This is a good late night spot also and they have trivia and game nights. .,We've had their Greek Pizza which is delicious; Pesto Cream Tortellini was very flavorful and creamy; Blackened Chicken Fettuccini could've used a little more cajun but no complaints; Wings (boneless &amp; traditional) have always been great; Spinach Artichoke Dip comes with Fried Pita which is a winner! Reasonable prices and good portion size.","Absolutely amazing!!! This is as close to Chicago style pizza as you will find in the Valley.,My husband and I have been out of the Chicago area since September and were desperately trying to find great pizza down here.,Well, we had no such luck until we stumbled across Vito's. .,It's quite a distance from our house in Goodyear, but worth every mile. .,The service is great and we were able to speak with both owners on the two occasions we stopped in (definitely not our last time visiting) They are great guys and had no problem stopping what they were doing to chat with us. .,The thin crust was great, cut in squares just like home :D . The deep dish, orgasmic.,The seasonings the put on top of the sauce make it just like home, the crust is just right, sauce is just right and there is nothing bad to say about it!! .,Each time we were in, we finished off the pizza with their homemade cannoli's.,Let me just say, they are almost as good as my grandpa's were! Just missing the pistachios!  .,The general location is a bit. . . well, not nice, but I've learned that the best food often comes from the least expected places. .,My husband and I will definitely be back for more!","A super healthy alternative to a greasy on the go lunch or dinner choice. .,The selections are all fresh, healthy, generous in portion, value priced and high quality.,The staff were full of smiles too, so that was great!.,The pizza looks delish, but I chose to build my own salad.,It was really tasty, and I'm glad I found this place!","Great option for happy hour.,Half priced pizzas, you can choose your toppings, and you even have the option to order a whole wheat crust.,It's hard not to get excited about the options!.,They have a great draft list as well, and there is always a cider on tap, which I love. .,I love coming here with friends, especially because we can all order a few rounds of drinks, share a few pizzas, and never spend more than $40 for four people.,Love it.","Sauce is either hit or miss.,It's a bit on the expensive side and suffers from mediocre management. .,It's one of those semi self-serve places; you walk up to a cashier to order, seat yourself, wait for servers to bring your order to your table and they might also come around to ask you if you need anything such as a drink refill. .,The ambiance is hip, comfortable and open which makes it an ideal spot to catch-up with friends. .,An entree item (pizza or salad) will cost you around $10.,The pizzas are scrumptious but I suggest getting normal/thin crust over their newer thick/pan crust.,Every time I've had the thicker crust it's been over-cornmeal'd.,Being on a budget, I usually order the mushroom and artichoke bruschetta and a soft drink for just under $7.,If I can spend a bit more I'll go for the caesar salad, though I skip the unsatisfactorily dry, cold chicken add-on. .,The service is even more hit-or-miss than the food.,Their staff seems to have a high turn-over rate with the exception of a couple great food servers.,I've had visits where the employees have been fantastic, and others where the cashiers have acted like I was doing them a favor.,During a particularly unfortunate and embarrassing incident a young woman incorrectly took my order and when the resulting price was significantly more than it should have been I politely corrected her.,She then stormed off into the kitchen and yelled at the staff, \"HE DOESN'T WANT THE PIZZA ANYMORE!! HE WANTS THE BRUSCHETTA NOW. \" loud enough to be clearly heard from the dining area.,I should have then called a manager but instead I accepted the $7 embarrassment and wouldn't return for nearly six months. .,I've since returned to satisfactory experiences.,Hit or miss . . . it's the risk you take.","This is paradise for beer connoisseurs.,A range of beer that confuses, bedazzles and quenches you thirst for quality brews.,The selection on lager and ales on tap as well as in the 'beer cave' make this place one of a kind.,The special hummus, fries, hot dogz, and pizza make it the perfect hangout place any given day in Pittsburgh","A frightening fact was revealed to me before my second trip to Cleveland with my fiance's family for Thanksgiving: in the 20 years that she has attended the family Thanksgiving in Cleveland, his sister has never been within Cleveland city limits.,Thank god we were able to correct that by visiting The Cleveland Museum of Art. .,Instead of doing Black Friday like the rest of America, after visiting family in the morning we decided to go to the Museum of Art because apparently it's FREE! And who doesn't love free?,Parking isn't free, but it also isn't terribly expensive, and since we had to drive there and there was no street parking, we were fine with paying for such convenient parking in their adjoining garage. .,Our first stop within the museum's new renovated addition was the cafe for lunch - which is one of the best museum cafe's that I have been to.,The food selection is great (salads, soups, fresh made sandwiches/pizzas. . . it all looks good), only slightly pricey but nothing that will break the bank, and the quality makes it easier to swallow.,Great staff, too, very friendly. .,Then. . . we explored the ENTIRE museum.,Really not that hard for someone who has done the same thing in many NYC museums.,The collections are extensive in historical scope, but on the small side for individual collections.,I'm a huge ancient arts fan, and that area barely sated my curiosity.,But the upper galleries are more packed, and more popular with visitors.,By the end of our visit we were mentally exhausted and ready to sit and not read anything for the rest of the day.,It is a well curated museum, and the design of the new building is lovely albeit somewhat confusing to navigate without going in at least one circle.,But remember: ITS FREE!","You know what you are getting.,Come on, this isn't the best pizza in town, but close enough to many homes in the Southern Ave and 19Th avenue basin.","Had a gift certificate and decided to finally use it.,The place only had parking for two cars, and while parking my car set off their automatic door. .,The lady at the counter was very nice and friendly.,I got a strudel(tasty but not much filling), seeded rye bread (it was good) 2 little individual cheesecake squares (those were so good) a pizza bread (tasty, but too much sauce for me, but friends liked it like that and finished my part), and that came to a little over $25.,For the cheesecake, I'll definitely come back here.","Yummy crust! I had the Ricotta pizza with pistachio pesto, mozzarella, and lemon zest.,I found it a bit too oily for my taste but the roasted pistachios give it a yummy saltiness that makes you want to keep digging in until the last bite.,My boyfriend had the Prosciutto with grape tomatoes and arugula, I had a bite of it and found it to be pretty good.,The place is small and inviting, could seat max 20 people.,Prices are good for the quality you get.,For both pizzas including tax and tip 37$","The first time I tried this place, I was moving.,Like. . . we don't even know where the dishes are anymore so we need to eat out of the cardboard box.,I absolutely hate chain pizza places, so Yelp! steered me in the direction of Roberts. .,It's solid pizza.,It doesn't taste like chain-cardboard.,The ingredients are fresh. . . and they have an amazing pesto pizza. .,It's greasy.,I feel like it would be the ultimate hangover pizza.,But, it's really greasy.,In a way that you just don't feel good about yourself after you've eaten it (at least when you're sober).,But, it tastes good in the moment.","I love Nello's. .,I'd like to write something prettier, something poetic.,It's one of my favorite pizza places, and it deserves a little wordsmithery.,But I'm too sated on deep-dish deliciousness to muster up my usual silver-tongued sweetness. .,If you like Chicago-style pizza (and I do) made fresh with quality ingredients in generous portions, try Nello's.,Their Hawaiian pizza is excellent.,Any of their pizzas are, really. .,Or you could smear some tomato paste and plasticky cheese on a piece of charred cardboard and call it \"pizza\".,It works for Domino's, after all.","Wow I was impressed!!!.,I purchased a voucher off kgb for $8 after a discount from a previous deal.,That gave me 30$.,Drove down with my bf and was a little turned off with the location (in a strip mall).,After finding a nice seat on the patio we felt like we were in a nice scottsdale/dt phx area.,They position the umbrellas to block the parking lot/strip mall behind you.,I ordered a glass of pinot and my bf got run&amp;coke for drinks.,We ordered a large caprese salad to share ($10. 99).,It was great! They had a small for $7. 99 and this large one.,It is a really great size, especially for a caprese salad, the basil was super yummy too! We ordered a large (12$ + 2$/additional topping) with mushrooms, kalamata olives, and half jalapenos (for him) and other half ricotta cheese (for me).,It came out and we were in shock - it was HUGE! After our first bites we were addicted! It tasted so authentic and delicious.,I can't wait to go back for that exact meal! The waitress was really nice and I was impressed how technologically advanced they were as they took orders on there iphones! Very cool! .,We even think there pizza is better than CIBO (which we thought would be hard to beat).,Super impressed with this little restaurant &amp; can't wait to go back again :)","There is a reason why the place is packed at lunch time. . . the pizza is AWESOME!  Dropped by before a ball game and we really, really liked it.,Tried different slices - BBQ, pepperoni, buffalo chicken and plain - they were all great.,Worth checking out.","You know when your friend has told you about a place  for years and then you try it and you're like, 'don't get it'?,That's this joint. .,We had an order of bread sticks, with a little cup of gas station nacho cheese for dipping.,The sticks were OK.  The bread, in fact, tasted like when you were a kid and your folks made white toast with margarine and put garlic salt on it and called it garlic bread.,I'm sure they have their devotees and it has some old school appeal, but meh. .,We also had two thin crust medium pizzas.,The size of a medium is small 12\" and I thought next time I would get a large minimum.,One of the pies was half pepperoni and half sausage, the other a \"Delight\".,They put the pepperoni under the cheese which is not my personal preference because it always makes me think, where's the pepa!  The Delight is a specialty order and comes with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions and green pepper.,The flavor was good, but the green pepper was a bit overwhelming to me and drowned out the other more subtle flavors of the mushroom.,The sauce is slightly sweet and you can taste the freshness of the mozzarella and to their credit both pies were well cooked.,They deliver too, which is a bonus.  .,Overall, it's A-OK, if you are looking for decent pizza, this is that place.","This restaurant has fantastic, authentic Italian food, great vibe, and wonderful service at a very fair price.,My husband is Italian and was very glad to find Trattoria Italia as he is often craving the food and ambiance from home and after several years living here in the states he has finally found just that!! We have had their pizza, aranchini, Canoli, and cassata Siciliana. . . all were fantastic! If you're looking for a great Italian place to eat here in Vegas, I highly recommend Trattoria Italia!!","Damn the pizza is good! Bring it with pepperoni and ricotta, a couple of side salads and boneless wings and I'm good.,It's about once a week for delivery. .,UPDATE: The food is becoming more erratic from Caliente.,The wings arrived tough.,Again.,The broccoli puffs got you the extra star.","A very sweet lovely admirable place on the way to Red rock canyon with a very nice service staff!.,Best is that they do slices of both New York and deep dish pizzas which were very yummy. .,The lunch pasta - Spaghetti marinara was delicious, tasted like homemade tomato sauce and just rightly flavoured! .,Loved it!","I love the pizza, but I've had just 1 good experience here when the weather was gorgeous in the evening on the patio.,The first time patio experience was bad because fruit flys (I think) were pretty bad.,I had a fine in experience 2 weeks ago.,It was cold so we decided to eat inside.,The smell inside is like a dirty drain and flys again, but not as bad.,The pizza was good, but I don't think I'll be going back.","Stopped here to meet a friend for a 'birthday dinner' after work on a Thursday evening.,The weather wasn't great (heavy rain) so that could have attributed to the partially full bar and restaurant.,It was early though, around 6:30, so if you're of the GenX range, this is a normal time, born after that, it is probably early!.,Really fantastic happy hour specials.,Domestic bottles and appetizers were half off.,We shared the ballpark pretzel which came with two pretzel sticks and two dipping sauces of cheese or honey mustard.,Very good. .,For dinner I ordered some wings and a flatbread pizza.,I immediately boxed half of each to enjoy at a later time, but to be honest, I didn't enjoy the bianca flatbread either time.,It just had little to no taste to it.,The wings were decent though.  .,Service was ok.,I noticed the wait staff going in and out of the bathroom a lot to use their cell phones.,But food came out quickly and was served hot, so not real complaints.","Definitely a place to go. . . . we went there after our show in December.,Most places were closed at 11:30 p. m. or close to it. . . but we were so happy that Pizza Rustica was open. . the serving staff were courteous and very accommodating. they gave us so many options, changed the topping on the 'set' pizza.  when he realized that one of our guests could not drink (she is pregnant), he was very attentive because he is a father.,He shared his loving stories about his son while serving good pizza and drinks. .,The wood oven pizza was good, tasty. . . but man, their service is outstanding. . . .,A nice gem of a place to go . . .","So I couldn't tell you what Gus' pizza tastes like because they wanted a $7 service charge (before tip) on an $11 order to deliver anything.,Classic craphole that will be out of business soon.","I got the carry-out XL pepperoni special.,It was quick, hot and delicious.,No fancy frills, but tastes like real pizza which is more than can be said for many or the pizza places in the area.,They also have a variety of other food, like french fries and snacks, that will keep the picky eaters happy. .,Their other pizzas seem pricy, but not having tried them yet I can't vouch one way or the other.  .,Service was friendly and quick.,If you're the unsociable type who's bothered by staff speaking foreign languages, just stay away.,Personally, I couldn't care less when the food is good.","This place is. . . okay.,I've been here for Sunday brunch 3 times.,Twice as a group of 4 and once as a couple.,I'll start by saying it's definitely not worth $35/person.,If you get a groupon or some other good deal, it's ok.,The food here is mediocre and the coffees are SO SMALL. They make the tiniest lattes I've ever seen.,The desserts are all store-bought.,The pizza is decent but nothing special, same with the pasta.,There's one salad option and it's just spring mix. 2 types of meats available - lamb and beef - at the carving station.,Unfortunately, they were both really cold. .,Most of the food was kind of cold by the time you got your plate to the table, which made it a lot less enjoyable.,The interior is pretty nice.","This place is a wet, dirty diaper. .,The dirty food matches its dirty neighborhood. .,Their slow drivers on Oxy can't figure directions from a mile away.,When delivered, their pizza was lukewarm and tasted what I assume was old lady's socks.,This food will give raccoons nightmares. .,Perfect food to give to an enemy or gf you are breaking up with.","Buddy and I ate here on Sat/13 Jul about 1:30 pm. . - The complementary bread/cheesy bread twists were ok, and they did come with olive oil and a spicy dip. . - We split a $28(?) Gotham pizza which was large enough to feed us both.,It was basically a pepperoni and sausage pizza.  . - I'll give it 4-stars because it's inside the Aria, the food was good and service excellent, pricing fairly standard for a Strip eatery.,I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.","Fabulous woodfire pizza!! All their late night over the counter pizzas were deeeelish!!! I killed 3 slices! And they are not small slices and Iam not a big girl, just have a great big appetite for good pizza!  Perfect crust, cheese galore, not too doughy w a good amount of sauce.,Worth to eat there twice during my wknd stay!! Cheers!","I passed this place until the other half had a craving for pizza and suggested we try it.,I have to say that the first time we ordered it, it was AMAZING.  We have since ordered here when in the mood for pizza and it has been consistently tasty.,Decent sized pizzas with great taste.,I tend to like to make my own so their competition is my own cooking :)  When I don't feel like cooking and need a treat after a long week, this pizza is a good one.,Don't blink, otherwise you may miss this location!  It is right beside a gas station just off to the side.,We missed it the first time!","Came for a quick bite before a show because we love the atmosphere of being down at the LINQ so we always sit outside on the patio to enjoy the music and people watch. .,This time we tried the Crispy Brussel Sprouts with smoked bacon, potato, &amp; fried egg which was a huge appetizer for 2 people but could have eaten it as my meal!!!The egg on top really made the dish. .,We also shared the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich with tomato sauce, mozzarella, &amp; arugula on ciabitini bread which was mouth watering good! We love the pizzas here, but unless you're REALLY hungry, they are great to share.,Then if you're still hungry, choose something else from their great menu. .,The service is always good and the servers are SO knowledgeable.,You'll LOVE this place!!!","Kudos to the Minder Binder savers who preserved the wonderful aspects of the historic Minder Binders, but scrubbed it up so nicely!!  It is better than ever!  All the employees are extremely friendly and the food is very good and reasonably priced.,It would be so nice to have a few more vegetarian options.,Offering a veggie patty in lieu of the meat on the burger choices would be tremendous!  That little change would bring me, and other vegetarians, back more frequently.,Even though the veggie pizza and the fun salad are delicious, I can only repeat them a limited number of times.,Great fun though!","This place provides a consistent service and does not try to be something that it is not.,I took visitors here after our wedding and we had the fries and chili dogs.,The huge portions and options to dip your fries makes this place a destination when you want food that is not healthy.,Their burgers when you want one outside of typical fast food joints are exactly what you are looking for as you can load them up with toppings that stay on the burger and make it taste better.,Pizza here is when you want a \"greasy\" pizza that you use a napkin to dabble away the melted droplets from the cheese.","We're in our 30s with no children and still love this waterpark.,We typically go during the week, and, if you arrive early, you can snag lounge chairs under a cabana for relief from the sun (so you can actually spend a long time there). .,We love how it feels uncrowded, with not much waiting for slides.,The staff is friendly and helpful.,The grounds are spotless (bathrooms need a little more upkeep, though).,Only one slide was not working when we were there. .,I like how they have lots of levels of play.,Small splash pools for little ones, and everything from tiny slides to fully enclosed twisty ones.,Some slides require a tube, which is readily supplied by the ride.,You can rent a raft for just $5, and you get $1 back when you return it.,The raft is for wave pool. .,We love the free parking, and you can always print a coupon from their website. .,We finally had lunch there and have to say, it's really not good.,The chili on the chili cheese fries is terrible, although you do get a large portion.,The cheeseburgers were small and barely lukewarm.,The pizza is probably your best bet.,We saw a mom buy a whole one for about $16.,She asked them to slice it into 10 pieces to feed more kids.,Everyone in line wished they had ordered it!","This is Nook's second location, located within the Hilton Garden Inn in Downtown Phoenix on Monroe Street.,I originally reviewed their Indian School spot and gave them a solid three stars due to having respectable but somewhat pricey foods, with lots of hits and misses with their menu.,And honestly, in terms of the overall experience, I'd say that this location is more or less the same.,The restaurant itself has a cool setup and unlike the spot on Indian School, also features an outdoor patio. .,We started with a half-order of their fig bruschetta, which includes fig jam, prosciutto, asparagus, and a bit of goat cheese.,This item has always been consistently good, while their polpetinne (fried risotto balls) were fine as well. .,We've experimented with their menu before by trying their bolognese and being disappointed.,I assume their chicken marsala is still very good, while I'd imagine that their poutine (gravy fries) also delivers.,We decided to skip these options, however, and just get a diavolo pizza. .,Nook's pizza is a bit weird.,Ingredients are fine and crust has always had solid flavor, but their pizzas are always served incredibly dry and floury, in stark contrast to what we're used to at most places.,I guess it's more of a subjective thing, but I never find myself to be impressed as much as I wish I could be. .,For dessert, their options are a bit different than what we remembered.,We decided to order their buttercake, which seemed more like a cheesecake than anything else.,The dish heavily incorporates graham crackers, including a ganache and an actual miniature graham cracker itself.,The dessert was good, but if you're familiar with buttercake, you might be a little thrown off. .,Our server was incredibly slow - and I mean painfully slow in comparison to the usual quick service we receive at Nook.,The place wasn't very busy for a Saturday night, so I'm not sure what that was about. .,Prices are a bit high, which I've never felt are fully justified.,Overall, I'd still recommend Nook as a place to try out.,Although the food isn't quite as impressive as I think it could potentially be, it definitely has its fair share of fans.","I ordered an Italian calzone and a buffalo chicken salad for delivery.,They arrived in about 45 minutes, which given that it was a Saturday I thought was reasonable.,The delivery guy was very nice and polite and called me as he got to the front door of my building. .,The calzone was huge--imagine a medium sized pizza folded in half.,It was actually delivered in a pizza box.,It has lots of ricotta and mozzarella cheese, plus some Italian meats.,The bread part of the calzone was very good. .,The buffalo chicken salad was also a quite generous portion and was exactly as described:  mixed greens (arugula, baby spinach, etc. ), red onion, green bell pepper, french fries, grilled chicken tossed w/ buffalo hot sauce and cheddar cheese.,I got the homemade ranch dressing and it was really good.  .,I thought given the portion size, the freshness of the ingredients, and the fact that the calzone was made from scratch (the dough, sauce, etc. ) it was reasonable.,It will easily be 3 meals for me.","Great pizza!! And I'm from NYC I should know! Very nice employees! Smells so good! I really loved the pizza slices I ordered and the employees were very nice as well.,I can't wait to eat here again soon.,I only wished they delivered further than 2 miles away!","Consistently great service with a smile and a superb Spicy Fennel sausage thin crust pizza.,We drive from Mooresville just to see y'all !!!","I love Naked City Pizza.,This was my first trip to their Tavern -- a much better location with more room, better parking, than their location on Paradise (the only location I had been to).,It's hard for me to choose what to get here.,So many tasty options.,I always order too much, then take the extra home.,This time, I got a small poutine which was excellent.,Then got a Guinea Pie.,A new chef, I hear.,The pizza was a little under-done (which means it didn't have that crisp, caramelized crust) -- that's why only 4 stars.,I'll look forward to a return on my next trip.,Still, great food.","It's National Pizza Day!  No better way to celebrate than our local pizza joint.,Pizza By Robert is our favorite non-chain pizzeria west of the city. .,Their pizza is always cooked just right.,Crispy crust but never burnt, and the hint of sweetness in their sauce is an excellent addition.,The crust reminds me of Pizza Hut but in a good way (crunchy)  .,If your looking for a good hand tossed pizza check them out.,Medium 1 Topping $9","What an amazing food adventure.,I wish I had an additional stomach in order to be able to sample more of the amazing bites. . the Bad: So the space was a bit on the crowded side and there really not much room to maneuver around.,Layout was kind of strange, but it fit the overall space provided by the art museum.,Weather was kind of warm, but that's not something that can be controlled, contrary to popular belief.,Who brings their kids to events like this?,There is a time and place, this was not it.,Leave the kids and strollers at home.,Pretty weak bad list, I think. . the Neither here nor there: Beer selection was pretty weak, but I feel this was by design since it was a showcase of food and wine.,Beer has not quite made the foodie scene in Phoenix.,There were some strange selections/choices of food by the restaurants themselves that seemed odd.,It's been pretty well documented out in the web, but Federal Pizza not having pizza was strange.,There were only a handful of examples of this, so really a minor thing. . the Good: Great selection of restaurants.,Amazing selection of wines.,The food being put out by all (even the strange choices) was tops.,Add to the fact that they were not cooking inside their actual restaurants, but outside, and these wonderful chefs/cooks/helpers deserve a standing ovation.,I can't believe the level of quality and tastiness that some of these chefs are capable of.,What a treat for all the senses.,Really a fantastic time and I can't wait till next year.","Under new management, this place is great!.,We didn't try any of the alcoholic beverages, but tried out a good variety of the menu:. the pickle chips were a unique choice for appetizer. the taco pizza was a tasty speciality pizza. the pepperoni pizza was a classic pizza with the perfect amount of toppings. .,The real showstopper was the service here!.,Our server was knowledgeable and attentive.,The owner came over and talked and bonded with us .,It was a great experience! Can't wait to try out a grinder!","Decent food but don't expect anything fancy.,Watch out for their strange payment options. . . they got the best of us and made a very nice profit on us tourists.,We had the house salad (just ice burg lettuce and a few toppings), poutine, and a small pizza.,When it was time to pay, they said they only take cash or debit due to high credit card fees.,Turns out, they only take CANADIAN debit cards, so that left the cash option for us.,We didn't have enough CA dollars, but she agreed only to take US dollars at a 1:1 (current exchange rate was actually about 1 US to 1. 20 CA). So we gave her $40 us to pay for a $29 CA meal, got back $10 CA. . .,So the meal cost us quite a bit more and we were left with Canadian dollars that we will never use as we were headed back to the US. We even offered to pay the credit card fee above the meal price, but she declined. . . . they are clearly using some deceptive money practices there.,Put a bit of a sour note on our visit to this local restaurant.","opens late, close to u of t, always hot pizza, generous amounts. mm-mmm","Originally went here because of a restaurant. com certificate. .,The place was busy, but we received great service from our servers, and the food was good. .,We had the thin crust Monster pizza - yum!","Bleh. .,Maybe their pizza slices + pop deals are decent value, but my standard medium regular pizza (plus pineapple - yum!) was only a teeny tiny marginally fractionally  bit nicer than the same order at the neighbouring Pizza Pizza, but three dollars more expensive. .,I'm also pretty sure one of the staff members who dealt with me was high. .,Judge me all you like, but I'll head back to Pizza Pizza next time.","If you're looking for CHEAP, I guess this is the place.  .,They serve all of the pizza and salad you can eat for $5. 49 (soft drinks are $1. 79, or free for seniors).,There's a temporary lunch special for $4. 99 including drink. .,The two types of salads were fresh tasting and good.,They had a variety of pizza to choose from.,While the pizza LOOKED really good, the taste didn't match the appearance.,It really tasted like inexpensive frozen pizza that you'd get from a grocery store (I didn't see them making it, but I wouldn't doubt that it was made in a factory somewhere and shipped frozen) and the crust tasted like cardboard. .,The place really isn't meant for \"Pizza Snobs\" to enjoy a quality pie.,It's meant to be a cheap alternative to McDonalds, and it seems as though it's marketed that way (photos of kids and teens eating pizza hanging all over the walls, arcade in the back, \"Macaroni and Cheese Pizza\" as one of the types). .,There were teens and families with small children everywhere.,I was the only person not there with someone under 18.","Lebanese Bakery Cafe and Desserts is located on Birchmount Road South of 401. .,I would never notice this place because it is like tugged inside a factory looking complex. .,The inside decoration is really simple but quite comfy with plenty of seats and even a little fireplace with armchairs. .,There are 2 areas you can order food from. . one is the bakery for pizza, fatayer(pies), shawarama and salads. . .,We tried some of the little appetitizers ($1 to $1. 50) each which are all really tasty.,I love the dough!

(Two glasses of average wine shouldn't cost more than one of the pizza entrees. ) And 2. they charge $9 for 4 slices of garlic bread and $14 for three medium sized meatballs, which seems a little excessive for what you get.,Maybe if they charged a little less for drinks and apps, they might sell more.,The cigar room is good but the ventilation isn't.,You can smell cigars sitting outside the room so that's not too good when you're tying to enjoy a nice meal.,I've eaten here several times and will likely be back, I only wish they were a little more reasonable around the drink and appetizer prices.","Living in a town of spas and resorts, with so many local \"stay-cation\" destinations, there is fierce competition to offer the best amenities, facilities, pools, spas, dining, and relaxation.,My number one choice for all of the above is Firesky.,Romantic, intimate, superior accommodations, outstanding food and drinks, unbeatable amenities, outstanding customer service from the front desk to the bar and grill. .,Things I love about Kimpton Hotels as a whole:. 1.,The \"In Touch\" loyalty program:. -Customizing your stay and an added surprise. .,Not only can you customize your personal preferences such as the type of pillows you want on your bed, or whether you want a yoga mat in your room, but you receive a $10 \"raid the mini bar\" card upon each check'in. . -The mini bar is fantastic with everything your snack-loving heart could desire from Goodie bags with gummy bears to Clif and Luna bars, organic dried fruit, Snickers, nuts, and even more specific essentials such as Tylenol, band-aids, and intimacy kits ranging from $3. 50-$6. 00. . -Free Wi-Fi in your room and around the resort. . 2.,Meeting all of your needs with amenities galore. . -This is a big one! .,Perfect example of exceeding expectations here was although our room did not have a DVD player, the front desk had one sent up and connected for us, free of charge.  (I have stayed in other local hotels where there was a $25 charge just for having one in the room). . -A long list of complimentary items in (case you forgot them at home) such as computer/mobile chargers, feminine hygiene products, razors, clippers, USB cards, and humidifiers. . -Take one of their custom designed bikes around town, and you can even add a gourmet picnic basket. -Complimentary transportation within a 3 mile radius, perfect for going out in Old Town. . -Hosted complimentary wine hour every evening at 5p in the lobby. . 3.,Superior Accommodations. . -Pillow top mattresses and super plush feather pillows make their beds a dream come true. -Rain showers and C.,O.,Bigelow Bath and Body Products. -Funky and comfortable bath robes, ours were cheetah print. -Fully stocked honor bars. -Flat screen televisions. 4.,Exclusive offers sent to your email. . -Often that means you can get a room here for $99 - and if you find a better deal on another site (i. e.,Hotels. com) they will not only match but either give you an additional credit, or in our case - matched the price and sent a bottle of chilled champagne to our room. . 5.,Eco friendly practices:. -They recycle everything from phones to batteries. . -They buy organic coffees and teas . - They serve organic wines during their evening complimentary wine hours. . - The cleaning staff uses green products. . 6.,Pet Friendly. . -Pet beds and food and water bowls delivered to your room. . -Your furry friend even gets a welcome board with his or her name. .,Things I love about Firesky:. 1.,Taggia Restaurant. .,Coastal Italian with modern twists, superior ingredients.,Locally sourced ingredients, seafood flown in fresh daily. . -A must try and one of the best pastas I have had: Chitarra (langoustines, artichokes, truffles, mascarpone). . -Offers delectable pastas, pizzas, halibut, scallops, even roasted bone marrow. . -Extensive wine list, custom cocktails such as Prickly Pear margaritas or Basil Pear Gimlets. 2.,The Property. .,Small, intimate, easy to get around - has the look and feel of a Hawaiian resort. . -Torch-lit Pool, known by this name at night when torches magically illuminate the pool has poolside bar and wait service, ideal for adults, and features some comfortable canopied day beds.,No tto mention the \"Aqua Bar and Grill\" has fanstic burgers. . -The Sandy Beach pool is ideal for families and young children, and features a sandy beach. -The Lagoon.,Sitting areas and fire pits make this a perfect and calming space for relaxing with the morning paper, or sitting around a fire with friends at night. .,Absolutely perfect in every way!","A friend and I came here for lunch to try their items.,We ordered:.,Chicago style pizza dip.,Bacon and beer nuts.,Roast pork sandwich.,Sweet Italian beef sandwich.,Green chili pork.,Poutine.,Meeting at noon, the Goose Island Pub was empty save for two other patrons.,All sandwiches were shared between us.,I also ordered an iced tea which was refilled frequently. .,Starting with the bacon and beer nuts and the Chicago style pizza dip, I found the beer nuts nice and spicy with small pieces of bacon mixed in.,The beer nuts were quite spicy.,The pizza dip is a different way of having pizza without getting a pie.,It's served with pieces of garlic crust and you spoon the dip onto the crust with some giardiniera (if you want) and it's quite good. .,All three of the sandwiches had good flavors and the breads were soft and good.,The green chili pork sandwich was on a kaiser roll and had a fried egg. .,Finally, I have to mention the poutine.,This is the only place in Las Vegas to get authentic poutine.,It was the first time I had tasted real poutine and it was quite good.  .,Service was very good.,The place was very quiet.,I'm not sure if the Hard Rock's clientele were all interested in going to the pools but I sure saw a bunch of scantily clad ladies heading that way. .,Chef Bradley Manchester has come up with a limited menu of good sandwiches and snacks.,This is a great place for getting a quick sandwich and a beer.","My review is based on late night visits.,Decent local pizza joint that has your basic slices (pep, Hawaiian, vegetarian) and then a couple Indian twists: Tandoori slice and Donair Slice (ask for sauce) and both of these are delicious.,Always hot and ready slices, whole pizzas are available too.,The guy who works here is a nice, he likes to joke around with clientele.,Love the graffiti and sticker bombs inside the place (which is standing room only).,Great late-night/after bar food, don't expect anything else.","So most of the reviews we read showed how the Flamingo was a bad hotel.,I beg to differ.,We got a great rate for room and flight through Vegas. com $236 for a flight and hotel for 2 nights, 3 days.,We weren't expecting much for the room, because who stays in there room in Vegas anyways?.,POOL: Why we chose the Flamingo, THE POOL! The GO pool is totally worth the stay.,There is one major big pool with a waterfall and there is a small pool towards the entrance.,The upstairs area pool is for kids and families.,There are palm trees in the water and there is a small lagoon area.,Dancers come out at around 11 - 12:00 PM noon to dance while trendy tunes are blasting around.,They have happy hour specials from 8 to 12 PM. $20 bucket of beer (5) and $5 bloody marys and Coors Light cans.,There is a grotto, several drink stands and servers that walk around to take orders of food and drinks.,We ordered a chicken quesadilla and chicken tenders and were super happy with the taste and portions.,Can't complain here.,You are not supposed to bring in food or drink.,They will allow coffee and water.,Yes, things are a bit expensive in regards to drinking at the pool.,Their collective flamingo cup with slushy alcoholic beverage runs about $22.,Get there at 8:00 AM when the pool opens, so you can get a good seat, otherwise you won't find one and you will have to lay your towel out by the pool and sit.,Cabanas get booked fast.,Daybeds are $249.,Not sure how much lounge chairs are.,Think you can book ahead on the cabanas, possibly online.,NEED YOUR ID and ROOM KEY TO get into the pool, so plan ahead! Towels as you walk in. .,ROOM: We arrived around 11:00 PM. We asked for an early check in.,It would have been $30, which isn't a big deal.,But the lady asked us if we wanted an upgrade for $20 and she would wave the early check in rate.,SOLD. Our room overlooked Caesar's Palace.,The beds had white sheets and covers with a pinkish furry thing at the end of our bed.,There were two Flamingo property photographs that were trendy on the walls.,The couch was grey with pink trimming and our view was great.,We were pleased with what we had.,Yes, the bathroom looks a bit dated, but everything was functional and clean.,Again, you shouldn't be in your room, so we were happy with the location on the strip and our view.,The Flamingo is a great location on the strip.,You can easily get to Caesar's and its about a 10-15 min walk to Bellagio and the Paris.,About a 20 min walk to Cosmopolitan and Aria.,Taxi cab rides to Cosmpolitan or Aria were about $10.,Split the costs with your friends and you are saving a lot more money.,Amenities like coffee, shampoo/conditioner in one, soap.,TV was fine and the AC worked very well. .,TIP: If you have a total rewards card, you go into check in a lot quicker.,We bypassed 100 guests by going into the Total Rewards line for check in.,CHA CHING! If you don't have one, go over to the Total Rewards desk, get your Total rewards card and then go check in.,You'll save time.,Also, your Total Rewards card will get you discounts here and there on Harrah's properties (Harrahs, Flamingo, the Quad, Caesar's, Ballys etc) .,Paradise Buffet: We were planning on going off the strip for lunch, but we were at the Flamingo and saw a buffet.,We paid $30 but added on a $9. 99 all you can drink beer, wine, bloody marys, mimosas deal.,The buffet was typical with prime rib, shrimp, chicken, pasta, salad, mac and cheese and lots of desserts.,I drank my $9. 99 mimosas and beers and had a great buzz going on! So, if you sit there for awhile and drink, you'll get your moneys worth, especially since all the casinos charge so much for drinks.,Of course you could sit at a machine or gamble and stock up, but that could get expensive.,So remember that many of the Harrah's properties have the $9. 99 all you can drink option for their buffets, expect for Caesar's Bacchanal buffet. .,Casino Payoffs: Pretty good.,I had luck here.,Played Star Wars, played Sex and the City and the Hangover and won money, so I'm a happy camper. .,There are Flamingos as the pool, real live ones.,Saw a lot of people eating at a pizza bar located by the Paradise buffet.,Looked and smelled delicious.,A reasonable price to stay at a central location.,They have renovated areas and rooms, so give it a try.,Again, dont compare it to Bellagio, Encore, Wynn or the new places.,If you want to save some money, stay here.","Not impressed with this place at all!.,I've eaten here many times and it gets increasingly disappointing every time.,The sushi pizza is more like a flat bread sushi pizza, so it's almost  like fried toffee when you try and chew it. . . . very gross.,The gyoza is okay, cooked well and very tasty, but the seaweed salad is horrible.,The maki's and hand rolls are never spectacular.   .,And you know this would all be forgivable if this place was cheap, but it's pricey for what you're getting.,I would pass on this one.","We had Fazio's deliver dinner last week &amp; I can say, that it is as good as any pizza I've eaten from the South Hills.  (If you know who I mean).,I ordered a large white pizza w/ mushrooms &amp; extra cheese and a Italian hoagie.,Both were fresh &amp; delish!  The extra cheese was not necessary.,There was enough leftover for dinner the following Monday.  .,The delivery person was very friendly &amp; helpful.,This is my new go to pizza place and I live in an area that have plenty choices.","Really warm and friendly staff, delicious margarita pizza! Will definitely go back and excited to try other things on the menu!","We had a beer at the bar and ordered a pizza to go.,It was a very pleasant dining experience, with the hard-working bartender being very attentive but not obnoxious. .,The pizza is something special with extraordinarily fresh mozzarella and a tasty sauce that had some texture, but not too much . . . for a person like me that won't eat chunks of tomatoes. .,They kept the pizza in the \"crisper\" for a good 25 minutes while we finished our beer and by the time we got back to the hotel it was pretty soggy.,Sticking it in the oven mostly brought the crisp back. .,From the look of the salads around us, they were generous.,I really like this place and would definitely go back. . (Beer and wine only, with a very limited liquor selection)","My girlfriend threw a suggestion for lunch out of left field today! .,One of her customers came and raved about the pizza at Mangia and Bevi - a very cool looking joint on the east side (right across from the Toronto Sun building) on King Street East . . . and I was excited to try something different. .,We had a simple lunch:  I had the Salata Pizza, pretty nice with ricotta, black olives, roasted tomatoes and arugula and my girlfriend had the Giudaica, which was excellent! It had percorino, artichokes, mozzerella and mint.,One of the nicest combinations I have tried.,We shared both pizzas and unanimously declared the Giudaica the champ!.,If they had a wood-burning oven, it would put their pizza over the top!.,I also love that they serve hot antipasto with the pizzas!.,The wine was basic, but the portions were quite generous for the price. .,Good simple quaffing wine.,I had a really nice glass of Nero D'Avola for eight bucks!.,Service was really nice and the everyone appeared to be very down-to-earth. .,I would love to return for dinner sometime . . . and perhaps try one of the pastas or even the funghi nordici salad (saut\u00e9ed mixed mushrooms / arugula x-v oil / aged balsamico / parmigiano).,Ciao for now and head out to Mangia sometime soon!","Great customer service ! Everyone was very sweet ! The chicken Parmesan was delicious!!! The garlic knots were great as well! The pizza was huge &amp; perfectly seasoned ! Must check it out !","Have mostly ordered delivery from here and they never disappoint! We usually get our pizza thin crusted/ well done, with pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives.,The seasoning is on point and the sauce is perfect for the pizza.,Going to the restaurant may be tough due to lack of parking but it is honestly more enjoyable at home with friends.","Everybody claims to know great pizza when they taste it.,I'm no exception.,Born and raised in New York, I've had the opportunity to try some really great pizza.,And I've eaten pizza all over the country and even in Italy. .,Okay.,Now that you know I'm an expert. . .,Nello's serves up some really great pizza.,I had a \"mini\" size with pepperoni, jalapeno, and anchovies.,Perfectly done! Great flavor (although you might wonder how with anchovies).,They have got really great pizza sauce as well. .,All I had was the pizza, so can't speak to other dishes they offer.,But I heard no complaints from those around me, and the food I saw looked attractive and appetizing.,Nello's has a very good staff (read attentive, quick, and friendly).,I hate to say \"you can't go wrong\".,But Nello's seems to be a great choice no matter how you slice it.","You can't beat the pizza, beer, atmosphere or staff; always friendly and fun.,I won't eat pizza anywhere else.,Radio City is a hidden gem in Vegas!","Peking duck and pizza are two of my favourite foods, so to hear that they were being combined was a dream come true.,Levetto was pretty easy to find - just north of Dundas &amp; Spadina.,We walked in at around 2pm for a late lunch, and there was only one other table there.,Though the space isn't large, the minimalistic interior keeps the restaurant looking spacious. .,You can choose between four or six slices of a rectangular pizza.,We opted for two smalls of the Peking Duck pizza and Soppressata pizza, which came to just under $20.,The Peking Duck pizza is topped with hoisin sauce, scallions, and cucumber, while the soppressata comes with large basil leaves, dried sausage, and rich tomato sauce.,Both were so delicious, with very crispy crusts. .,The servers were all very nice, and I would love to return to Levetto to feature more of their items!","I just love this place.,And have I told you how much I love their eggplant parmesan?! I truly appreciate that they leave it unbreaded, so you can truly enjoy the flavor without all the over abundance of breading.,Monday is half price pizza night, yum!! And this is what keeps me coming back time after time after time.","I used to like their pizzas, but twice already I couldn't get in! First time, I get a rude employee saying that we aren't open! And tonight I rang the doorbell twice and I was ignored!.,And another thing. . . why did you stop serving bacon on pizzas?","My parents came to visit, and I needed somewhere to take them that would please everyone.,I am really glad we chose here.,They were both extremely happy with their pizza.,I ordered the truffle pizza, which was delicious.,I will say that it did not taste very strongly of truffles - in fact I can't even remember tasting them at all, which considering it was the most expensive pizza it was slightly disappointing.,My partner ordered a pizza with pesto, and he wasn't a huge fan of the pesto which I believe is almond based, making it slightly sweet.,I do wish that there were more non-pork options - be it either vegetarian or not.,Overall, satisfying and fairly quality ingredients, just needs a little fine-tuning to make everything shine.","Desperately craving pizza, but not of the Pizza Pizza variety, I headed to Pizza Rustica for the first time on the recommendation of a friend who had walked by it many times, never been, but ensured me it always smelt \"very, very good\". .,We arrived at about 7:30 on a Friday night, and I was surprised at how very small this place is.,There are about 10 - 15 tables and a bar area, and unfortunately we got there just as the last table was snapped up.,Luckily there were 2 spots left at the bar, and we were able to get a drink while we waited.,A nice surprise occured when our would-be waitress approached us and asked if we'd like to order before we got our table, as the food would arrive as soon as we were seated.,Nice one.,My stomach at this point was practically jumping out of my throat, so speed was key. .,Once seated (about a 20 minute wait at the bar), our food arrived approximately 5 minutes later.,I ordered the Tre Carne pizza, with a ton o' meat and banana peppers, onions and tomatoes.,The ground beef was fantastic, really flavourful.,The pizza itself had a nice thin crust and a thin but balanced layer of sauce and cheese.,I personally am not a fan of thick crust or too much sauce - less is more, so this suit me perfectly. .,All in all my pizza craving was asauged, and the leftovers (and unless you are ready to eat a small horse, there will be leftovers) tasted even better warmed and with a little hot sauce the next day.,The place itself is a little small, so if there are no bar seats I'd move along, as the wait isn't worth it if you're standing around for 20 minutes.","A friend once told me a pizza stone is the secret behind great pizza bread. im going to bet they use a stone here.,Bread tasted flawless and i came in on a full stomach. ok i've only tried this one pizza here called Terra (Roasted potatoes, sweet pancetta, red onions, mozzarrella, with spinach) but im going ahead and say that this place is in my top 3 pizza joints in Toronto. great value pizza and friendly service, usually lots of parking on the street. only thing i should point out is its shallow wine list. i think a solid pizza place should have a deep wine selection","8. 50 with tax for a one topping pizza, and $4 for a pitcher before 6pm (and $6 after).,The $4 pitcher can even be Yuengling or Blue Moon.,Makes for a cheap dinner with friends. .,The pizza is greasy but surprisingly tasty.,It's a bit smokey (I can't wait until PA is no smoking in bars like Maine and California). .,Dollar drinks Friday night attract quite a few students.","Crush vaulted to one of our favorite Vegas restaurants, especially on the strip.,Had the ricotta gnocchi with braised beef, and my fianc\u00e9 had the date, artichoke, and jalape\u00f1o pizza.,Both were outstanding.,French onion soup was solid as well.","I always visit Five50 when I'm in Vegas.,It's tucked into Aria, towards the Sports Book.,It's not a huge place but it's a hidden gem in my mind.,The pizza is some of the best I've had.,If you're in the mood for pizza on the strip, Five50 is must to check out.","My first visit here and i was going to use the groupon i bought, but they had a special of half off any pizza so i decided to try that and save the groupon for another time.,I can say my daughter and i enjoyed the pizza, far from the usual papa johns or pizza hut. she usually doesnt like thin crust but loved it. and while my only complaint is that the end of the pizza was a lil soggy but that was due to the fresh vegetables.,Overall it was good enough for me to try again.","Our favorite close to home spot! Foods always good, wing night in Wednesday's is our favorite! But the pizza is delicious as well!","I'm new to the city and am so glad that I found my go to pizza place already!! So far I've tried their Hawaiin pizza and Buffalo bbq pizza, both with turbo crust and they are just awesome!! They do delivery and catering as well.,Once I did delivery and they were really quick.","So I'm pretty much an old lady.,Although, I do like to pretend that I know what's hip and occasionally douche it up with the young'ns.,But, this wasn't one of those times.,I took the family to Vegas for a weekend getaway and South Point offered the best value.,Yeah it's off the strip but it's fine if you drive here because you could just take the 5 minute drive in if you choose to.,This hotel is beautiful inside and out.,It doesn't feel all used and abused.,It's very family friendly.,They have a bowling alley, a movie theater, an equestrian center, an arcade, and all the other things you'd expect from a Vegas hotel; the casino, a spa, fitness center, barber shop, and pools.,There's the main pool, a kiddie pool, and a jacuzzi.,There is a daily fee for the fitness center, though, wack. . .,The room was nice and clean, 500 sq. ft. , the bathroom was big and had a door separating the bathtub from the vanity, which is awesome, right?,I also had a view of the pool. .,The main floor has something like 9 restaurants, a few of which I did eat at.,Also, the bowling alley has a snack bar that serves pizza, hot dogs, nachos, that type of thing. .,There was something wrong with the elevators while I was here, not sure if it happens all the time, but, there were only two of the six elevators working; kind of inconvenient. .,Overall, I had a great time.,It was nice to get away and relax like a grown up. . side note: I won my first night there and then lost it on the second night. .,My review and/or star rating was not affected by this experience.","I've eaten enough frozen dinners to know that their alfredo dinner is just a frozen dinner meal reheated.,Same noodles, sauce, and chicken.,Same with their jalape\u00f1o poppers.,Stick to the pizza here, it's decent.","On a Thursday night in August, my husband and I happened upon this three-week-old restaurant south-west of Vieux-Montreal.,The small restaurant seats 20 or so comfortably with additional seating at the bar.,The place was a buzz with activity.,We did not have reservations and the hostess hesitated before giving us a table. .,Rustic wood floors and brick walls made Jane feel warm and welcoming.,The menu, as in many restaurants in Montreal, was written in chalk on a large black board.,The food was fresh and seasonal.,The main courses were mainly pizzas with one Fish option. .,We shared a warm Asparagus salad with duck shavings and mushrooms.,All was drizzled with a pleasantly tart vinagrette. .,I had the Schwartz pizza of smoked meat and cheeses. (See the Famous Schwartz Deli site).,There was cheese in the perfectly baked crust.,It was nice and thin under the toppings, but full enough around the edges that I could really enjoy the bread! .,My husband had the cod special - seared cod served on a bed of mushrooms and asparagus in a seafood stock. .,The staff were friendly and the service was very good - I could tell these people knew what they were doing. .,A great little place!","Love this place! Our family really enjoys the patio! Great bruschetta, salad &amp; pizza!","Liz J. and I visited Caliente's for the first time about a month ago.,We were super hungry and wanted to try everything on the menu!.,We ordered the loaded fries and breaded zucchini to start.,They were both delicious! Although they were amazing, they weren't anything out of the ordinary when it comes to bar appetizers. .,Next, we ordered the buffalo chicken rolls and the jalapeno bacon rolls.,I assumed we would be receiving two small orders, since they were only $7 each and I became adjusted to receiving small portions of rolls at restaurants. .,No. There were six rolls in each order and they were HUGE. I was only able to finish one of each and I was completely stuffed.,They were homemade and absolutely amazing.,The flavors were awesome and they went deliciously with their homemade ranch. .,I was pleasantly surprised with my visit to Caliente's.,I assumed it was going to be just another pizza bar, but it wasn't at all.,Awesome service, a great selection of drafts and OUT of this WORLD rolls!

I am a huge Metro fan but this place is cheaper and has a lot of heart.,The food is so hot when it gets here I always burn my mouth.,All the other food I have tried is good but the pizza is the real star.,A rare gem in this city!!","After hearing so many people in the area raving about Folco's I finally decided to try it out.,And we were looking for a reception spot for a Baptism - which we let them know when we walked in.,I was disappointed about the food.,The veal parmigiana was sub-par.,Too much sauce, very dry meat which was overcooked.,My husband tried a pasta dish which was \"ok\" we were told pasta was made fresh in house.,The drenching of sauce on the pasta killed any taste I was hoping to get out of it.,The caesar salad was good &amp; so was the bruschetta.,Their tomato sauce - homemade I was told - tastes like something out of a jar.,I was hugely disappointed and felt their food tasted no different than the Italian restaurant across the street.,I was hoping to go back &amp; try out their pizzas, but there is a much better Italian restaurant in the Garden Basket Plaza that makes everything from scratch and I have been a regular of theirs since they opened.","1st time here, Sally at the bar tended us, ordered chicken skewers, mixed &amp; match baskets, house salad.,Ordered a pizza with Pepperoni and mushrooms, received a pizza with mushrooms, pepperoni and sausage.,Sally caught the snafu promptly and the manager Shelby came and fixed the situation by offering us a free pizza for a future visit.,Knives, forks and wet naps were given to us prior to eating which is a plus.,Bar was clean, lighting was dimly low but that is ok because the location was at maybe 7% capacity.,Pizza is thin crust, you save $1 by ordering a whole pizza as opposed to a whole pizza by the slice.,Enjoy! Bon apatite!","It's a great neighbor place.,The pizza is great.,The salads are airways fresh and the chicken fingers are delicious! Always friendly and fast service.","I had heard so much about this place I expected five star food but not this night.,Our small sausage pizza was over cooked and terrible.,My meatball sub, which I normally judge a place by, had a great bun, nice meatballs and cheese but was dry and totally tasteless.,It's the sauce that makes the difference and it just had no pizzaz.,I hate to say it but subway has a better sauce than what I got here.,In hindsight I should have asked for a cup of sauce on the side to dip it in.,I do like them sloppy so that might have made the difference.,Our other diners had a 16 inch pizza that was perfectly cooked and very good so the place can do it but apparently not every time.,The deserts were fabulous so be sure to look at that menu.,Last, a little pet peeve of mine, our server, who was very good, needs to stop asking\"how is that tasting \" everytime  she walked by our table.,It got annoying after about the third time.,So, its is a cool little place and was busy and cosy but on this night I was not impressed and would not rush to return.","The thin crust pizza here is the best I've had in the valley.,The thick or deep dish is just okay it doesn't really do it for me to say the least.,But boy are the flavors there when you order the thin crust.,We always used to come here on Tuesdays to get the Tuesday take out special which apparently stopped.,When we called today to go get the usual Tuesday deal to us the dead give away was when the man over the phone had asked us what kind of large soda we would like and when my boyfriend had asked if he meant to say 2 liter he said no.,So now that they have taken away my Tuesday special I can tell you at this moment that the chances of us going to nellos after this are slim to none. .,I'm severely disappointed that they have no specials anymore but nothing lasts forever I guess.,I will miss you nellos very much I will but I guess we will be sticking closer to home and trying out pizza on 87. . . . sigh. . . . :(","The 10\" Margherta pizza smelled fresh and yummy and the 4pc Chicken mix was also very tasty, but the chicken was a pinch salty but still juicy.,The garlic bread and wedges that came with the chicken mix was pretty good.,Some of the garlic bread was bit tough but still has a good flavor.,The wedges are nicely flavored and crispy.,Was a bit pricey but sort of worth it.,Overall I give it a 8 1/2 out of 10.","Excellent pizza -- the best delivery I've had.,Tasty and not too greasy. .,LOVE the restaurant's emphasis on sustainability -- they use local ingredients and have a lot of environmentally sustainable business practices. .,Fantastic pizza and socially conscious -- we just found our new go-to pizza place.","The pizza is good, a little limited in variety, but that is the traditional thing, I guess.,Does not feel very welcoming or comfortable to sit in but we often enjoy the take out.","Great location .,Very nice inside as well as outside. .,The pizzas and pasta were superb. .,Great service and nice atmosphere.","Poor service.,Terrible food.,Soggy and undercooked, no understanding of the problem. .,Took 30 minutes to get an undercooked pizza.,Had our money refunded the food was so terrible.","Just left and it was my second visit.,I really love everything I've ordered so far! The butter pecan shake is to DIE for.,You get pecans in every sip, it's amazing.,I am not a soda drinker at all but I LOVE the tractor soda and I wish there was somewhere I could purchase it! The only thing I didn't like today was how long everything took.,It already took us 45 minutes to drive there, another 30+ minutes of waiting to order and 30+ to get out food.,Our food also came out all separate.,We got our milkshake first, 10 minutes later my bf got his burger and 15. minutes later I got my pizza.","Considering this restaurant is located directly below my office, I've never partaken in a meal here until the other day.,Literally, I was a \"kid in a candy store\" and was amazed by their setup here.,Almost cafeteria-esq style, you walk in, get greeted by the hostess/greeter person and he/she will give you a plastic card.,Depending on what you would like to eat for that meal, you walk up to the counter and order.,Place your card on the \"magic\" slot device and the put the item you are about to receive on it and you pay the cashier on the way out.,Kinda genius if you think about it.,Less waiters (they still bus the tables for you) and the tables are first come-first serve. .,I think my favorite part of this place is that they make their pasta in-house.,Even have a room dedicated to it.,During my lunch, I totally watched a guy make pasta from scratch and then put it through a machine.,Rotini was being made at that particular time. .,I ordered from the pasta station and the chef?/line cook was super nice.,I think he could tell I was a newbie, and was patient with me.,Deciding on the Smoked Salmon Carbonera. . . the started making my lunch right in front of me.,In about 7-8 min. . .,I had a delicious, steaming bowl of pasta presented before me.,My buddy had a salad which involved a beeper (so will have to try that next time).,And their pizza's look pretty awesome too. .,The restaurant space itself is modern with clean lines, but warm woods and decorated with small herb plants.,Each table has its own oil, salt, pepper, balsamic.,I tried to take it easy on the bread, but it was too hard to resist.","Girlfriend took me here for my birthday.,Awesome pizza.,A little pricey but well worth it.","Love it.,Owners are from West Babylon, NY. They had a pizza shop and Italian bakery in Islip Terrace NY right down the street from where I grew up.,I could not believe they lived here for so long and I was unaware.,Garlic Knots are great and the pizza is good NY style.,The family were all in tonight and visited our table when they heard we were from East Islip.,Uncle Joe is such a nice man.,The entire evening was just delightful.,I am happy to discover this little gem of a place and I will be back.,Happy to say they opened a Beall's outlet right next door too so I can shop and eat.,Well, at least until they move to their new location.","The sports deli at the Rio is our go to place for a quick snack or late night munchies.,The food is served fairly quickly and everyone is friendly.,The sandwiches are HUGE. I had the nachos this time, they were just ok, but a decent portion.,The pizza is average.,I really like the wings, you can order the sauce on the side and just have them crispy.,The only negative is the price, it is quite expensive - oh well.","The pizza taste just like pizza in  New York .,It has a thin crust  and they cook it in the brick oven.,The sauce is so full of flavor.,It is hard to find good pizza anywhere outside of New York but this is the best I have had so far. .,Im craving it right know.,I usually get the pepperoni or add hot peppers to it. .","Duck poutine pizza.,Of course, that is what everyone is talking about.,I'm still thinking about it the next day.,It's one of those dishes that is perfect for the great white north.,The kind of food you need to fatten up before the great hibernation.,If bears could, they would order the duck poutine pizza before they slept for the winter.,And after a lunch of this pizza I needed a nap.,It's definitely worth a trip to Bannock to eat this deliciousness especially if you need to bulk up for a long cold winter.","The atmosphere is gorgeous and I loved the garden just wished I had come during the day to check it all out.,Unfortunately the food is a bit bland.,We order zucchini chips, a Sonoran dog and the bbq chicken pizza.,The zucchini chips were the best item we ordered but just okay.,We will go back and try it again during the day maybe for breakfast.,Cute place but the food was disappointing.","I am visiting Calgary and this has become my new hang out spot.,The hookah is of excellent quality and very affordable.,The flavors available are great.,The ambiance of is very nice and relaxing.,At night they play music and it is always of great taste.,Another fantastic thing is the food.,We ordered a pizza and it was beyond amazing.,The crust was perfect and the cheese and the toppings.,It was such a great pizza that we have to definitely get it again before I leave.,This was a top 5 must go to place for me while visiting.","Great pizza at a small price.,Tonys is one restraunt in boulder city that really has good value with a great product.,Real pizza here.,The slices are awesome also. .","Visited this place on November 19th 2016, which is National Adoption Day, and the service was horrible.,The cashier that helped me was okay, but i got her to open up and become more customer friendly.,We had roughly 20 people with us as an adoption was finalized and we went there to celebrate.,As we had been sitting there possibly 15 to 20 minutes, a woman is all black with dyed blond hair came and placed reserved signs on the tables we we occupied and told us that we didn't have to move just yet.,At that time it was 1:40 pm and the reservation was for 2 pm and we haven't even received our food at the time.,The food came out sporadically as we'd get chicken wings, then bread-sticks and pizza last.,This place is going downhill and could be saved if the employees were more courteous to the customers as this is a consumer based business.","Went here with the office for our annual party and I expected decent food.,We went with the party menu which was set with shared apps and a choice of 4 different mains. .,From the time we sat down, our server at the bar appeared frazzled and took forever to get drinks set, made and served.,I tried the Italian Greyhound for my first drink, not only did it take 30 minutes to get to me, it came with 4 extra fruit flies on it. .,I twitted about it and was asked to DM so that they could speak to the management about it. .,After about an hour or so of waiting for all of our coworkers to get there, we then headed downstairs into the private room which I have to say have one of the coolest decor/ambiance I have been in. .,They started to serve the Palenta fries which was shared between everyone.,It was alright, bland and the marinara dip tasted like something you could get from Loblaws. .,The second starter they served was the pizza.,The crust was good, but if you eat the pizza with the toppings you will be met with the saltiest things ever.,So. . . needless to stay, I just ate the crust. .,The third starter was a platter of mini meatballs, tiger shrimps and the risotto balls which was basically an upscale cafeteria food.  .,For an Italian place, the meatballs tasted like a frozen dinner meatloaf rolled up into little balls.  .,Next served was the salad and the tomato and cheese appetizer.,These 2 I believe was the only ones I was able to eat with no problem although I think the salt that tomato/cheese app needed all was put into the Pizza. .,The mixed mushroom appetizer came next and was ok.,It seemed fresh and was nice. .,For the main, I chose the Fettucine, which came with Shrimps, pesto, mascarpone cheese and a touch of tomato sauce. .,I won't hold back on my review because honestly, for an upscale place, I was hoping to be blown away.,The pasta was WAY overdone, there was a mixture of frozen package shrimps and the tiger shrimps so the cook on both were totally off.,I think that I would have had a better tasting pasta from the cooked food section of a Loblaws.,I could not, for the love of God eat more than a bite full of this \"italian pasta\". .,The Chef's selection of deserts however was good.,I think aside from the deserts, decor and the people I was with, nothing else was good.  .,At the end of the night, I had to go grab dinner at Sushi Inn just so that I could have a proper Dinner. .,Unfortunately, coming here with expectations and only being underwhelmed was a very big disappointment to me and my friends.,I would hope that in the future, they taste their food prior to serving them to their patrons. .,Food Score:.,Palenta Fries: 2/5.,Pizza: 0. 5/5.,Polpettine/Mini Meatballs: 0/5.,Arancini/Risotto Balls: 1/5.,Shrimp Diavola: 2/5.,Salad: 3/5.,Caprese/Cheese&amp;mozarella: 2/5.,Funghi/Mushrooms: 3/5.,Fettucine: 0/5","I would give this spot 10 stars if I could.,This is as close as it gets to real Italian pizza, which I have eaten plenty of in Italy.,That means, great crust, and no \"American\" tomato sauce, but rather a good fresh, ground, uncooked tomato sauce that gets cooked in the oven.,The pepperoni is not like you get in the US. It is sausage resembling more of a home made pepperoni with strong pork flavor.,The mozzarella cheese is made fresh and the parmesan is real, no fillers.,Salads are generous and very tasty with a simple dressing.,The owner and staff are very on point to make sure you know what you are getting and do a fantastic job at making you comfortable.,The only downside I experienced was that the glass of wine is small.,I don't know what their pour is but it is the only thing not generously given.,Not served in a traditional stemmed glass, it was more like a small 1/2 full glass of fruit juice.,But I went for the pizza, not the wine.,Also, short wait time.,The pizza bakes in 90 seconds once it is in the oven.,Novanta means 90.","We have been here a number of times and I really like the food and beer selection but the service, frankly, sucks.,If I could look past the service this would be a 4, maybe even 5 star review, but again the service consistently sucks. .,Let's review the service first and just get this out of the way.,Tonight we came in and it was moderately busy so we sat/stood at the bar.,We all ordered beers (at least 3 on their draught list were kicked but still on the chalk board.,How hard is it to erase a chalk board?) and our friends ordered a pizza.,The wait wasn't long for the pizza but when the kitchen brought out the pizza they just set it on the back bar.,And there it sat for 10 minutes while the bar tender and servers walked by it and wouldn't make eye contact with us.,Finally my friends were served their lukewarm pizza after we pointing out that it was there.,No apologies or acknowledgment of an issue were given.,When it started to clearing out we moved to a table and had some more beers.,At the end of the night a friend had to leave early so he cashed out his tab.,After our friend had left the bartender came over and stated that he had given our tab to my friend whom had left so we would need to pay his which was much larger.,He stated that we could just get the money back from our friend for the difference later on.,Once again no real apology was given.,I am really not sure how his mental error became my problem but it seems kind of ridiculous that I became responsible for it and it isn't like there is a manager on duty to deal with. .,Onto the good stuff.,The pizza is well above average and my wife especially loves the buffalo chicken pizza.,The wings are some of the best in town.,Fried crisp and sauced properly.,The beer list is also one of the best in the east end.,They boast around 20 taps and the selection is always unique and well rounded for even the most demanding beer guy or girl. .,Bottom line, I'll come back.,But I know that service will probably continue to suck and that I really have to be proactive as a customer when I am there.","Pizza is pretty good here.,Came in for a pizza at lunchtime place was pretty dead so didn't wait to long.,The beer was ice cold.,Will come back for sure.,If you haven't been here it's worth the trip.","Great pizza place.,This is the type of restaurant that is typically found downtown Pittsburgh.,We had the pork wings which had a smokey sweet BBQ sauce.,They were amazing.,The pizza was around 12 inches and was about medium/thin thickness.,It is pricey and I highly recommend going during happy hour to save some money.,Which reminds me, the beer selection was eclectic and I enjoyed some beers that I wasn't familiar with.,Absolutely recommend coming here.","The pizza was really good!.,They have interesting combinations but everything is really testing.,I've been here 3 night in a row. .,I recommend this","absolute garbage. 0 stars. flies crawling all over the slices. smells gross. pizza barely had any tomato sauce. pepperonis were like the ones from a lunchable. cheese is plastic crap.,I'm royally PISSED off &amp; papa ceo would be too!!!!!! gross!","We ordered a pizza for delivery, and waited 2 and a half hours with no delivery.,Called and the manager said they overlooked the order, we asked for a full refund and they gave us $10 off.,Delivery guy finally showed up and we had already ordered chinese.,Horrible customer service.,If the pizza is over 2 hours late, give it for free.,Better yet, NEVER order from a pizza place that takes 2 hours to deliver!!!","Spent the weekend at the Trump Hotel in Vegas across the street from the Fashion Show Mall.,While in the mall I noticed Grimaldi's Pizzeria.,A sign in front said it was voted best pizza by the Food Network.,Not sure if that's true, but that's what it said. .,I couldn't wait to try it out, so I ordered a pizza to take back to the hotel room.,Boy, was I underwelmed.,Not even close to the best pizza I ever had.,I think I should stay open-minded about this and maybe visit another location.,But at this point, it wouldn't even make my top twenty list.,I do have to say the service was good.,The bartender who took my order was very busy, but still took the time to walk back to the kitchen to check on my order.","My deliverer was fast and nice.,This is my go to place when I was some garlic breaded pizza.","Loved this place! Went for lunch.,And had the Bianca with sausage.,The pizza came out really quickly and was hot.,Loved that they have not only grated parm and pepper flakes, but also hot oil.,I also asked for a side of sauce (my pizza didn't have it on it) and they brought some with no problem.,The space is bright and really welcoming, and the people are friendly.,Will definitely be back!","Excellent food! Great staff! All around a great experience.,It's hidden in a strip mall attached to a gas station.,Who on earth would think this would have been one of my favorite pizza joints in the country?,The flavors were amazing.,Had the Guido and Zen Garden.,I loved them both.,I'll defiantly be back.,Go try it, you'll love it.","Cool ambiance.,Completely overpriced menu with mediocre food.,Lobster pot pie was over baked and tasted like a frozen one.,Sea bass was cooked nicely, but the rest of that entree was soupy and unappealing. .,Flatbread pizza was good, although a bit pricey.  .,The wine by the glass options were extremely limited. .,I expected more.","Ok so they charge a lot just for a single slice of pizza but what gets me is they charge a lot for what looks like old pizza that they reheat just to give to you which is one messed up and two gross I recommend going to Paris casino and go to La pizza same price but man is it worth it the pizza at that place was amazing definitely worth the walk and and use your money for better food!","Stopped here for a quick bite before going to dinner.,Had a delicious slice of pizza with goat cheese, onions, eggplant and heirloom tomatoes.,Pleasant service also and the place was packed with patrons.","Sucks!!! Totally sucks!!!! Sucks that I can't change what I get regularly there.,So good I get the same thing every time and some how taste better every time!

Why try and make inferior cuts edible.,Are they afraid of competition from the many more competent restaurants?,Anyway we ordered the Nordini and some pizza with sausage and dandelions on it.,Then we ordered a $95 steak,  it takes an hour to cook and comes basically raw in the middle.,Barely brown on the outside.,Really under done for me and nothing special to speak of at all.,I have had way better and at half the price.,The pizza was tasty,  but some of them are as much as $25,  seems crazy to me. .,Not a very good meal,  and I certainly won't be going back or sending anyone I know there.,Definitely over rated and hyped.,There is way better Italian in Toronto than this.","I am rating this for eat in only.,The pizza was awesome!! The loaded fries not so much, it was a very small serving and just bland.,We had plenty of drink refills and ate downstairs during a planned event.,I gave it a 4 based on the fact that one menu item was great and the other not.,I would like to try it again but skipping the fries.","I was here with friends a few weeks back and I must say I was quite impressed by the pizza they serve.,They have huge pizza on the display which is quite appetising. .,We ordered mushroom pizza and hot lips (I remember pineapple as one of the toppings).,Hot lips was quite an amusing name!! They give huge slices of pizza and one slice is like a small pizza you get at regular pizza joints.,They are also generous with the toppings they give.,One slice is totally worth the price!! I prefer adding extra chilli flakes to my pizza as it adds extra zing to the whole experience of eating a hot slice of pizza.,For drinks, I recommend the red ribbon mintt ginger dirnk.,Anytime during the day in hot summer, it is my favorite drink.,It also goes well with the pizza. .,I will go back again and if you are in southside with a bunch of friends or by yourself, you should consider visiting this place for a slice of the huge pizza they serve!!","Seriously, I feel like such a fool for not trying this place sooner.,I disregarded it for some hipster spot having a moment, but I was wrong.,A pizza place that has mastered crust, that reminds me so much of my favorite NYC spot in the west village.,Seriously, give this place a try.","Clean, nicely decorated pizza place.,The Margherita is simple and delicious.,Ingredients look fresh and the service is friendly.,Every time I go it's in the late afternoon so the place is pretty empty and the service is fast.,I would like to try the bruschetta. . . have only tried the pizza so far.","The pizza is bomb!

We love Ground Control in Litchfield and we were so excited that a new pub-style place was opening in Surprise.,Unfortunately this didn't live up to the hype. .,We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table (even though we saw open tables) and then were seated in the noisy bar in a very strange table.,We asked to be moved and you'd think we asked to move to the moon.,They put us near the pizza area, the only people seated there (which was weird).,We ordered beer, pretzels and cheese, and a burger to share.,The \"beer cheese\" was really bad.,It tasted like it came from a jar. . . they need to try the Mellow Mushroom beer cheese!! The burger was small and bland, fries were greasy.,With two beers and the small burger, it was over $60!! What a waste.,We won't be back.","Since we stayed at Aria we wanted to try restaurants the hotel had to offer.,Being from Chicago we know about good pizza.,The first time there we ordered a meat ball sandwich and wings.,I was a little disappointed they didn't have bbq wings and there beer selection was pretty weak.,The wings were ok the meatball sandwich was good.,The second time there we ordered pizza.,The pizza was really good and server Sheryl was great! We left that place with a smile.,For good pizza check this place out.","I just don't get it.,Why is this a local favorite?,The pizza is below average at best, with crust so thin they have to cut it into small squares to be handled.,I also ordered the Chicken Parmesan with linguine.,The chicken was tough and chewy and the linguine had a grainy dry texture with very little flavor.,They don't offer small side salads for dinner, only large two person salads.,I'd eat at Carrabba's everyday of the week before going back here.,The search for good pizza in Phoenix continues.","We had our daughter's birthday party at Uptown Jungle today.,I would have to say of all the places we have had birthday parties this was by far the worst experience.,Our party was from 1-3.,When confirming the details of the party we discussed with the party planner the strategy needed in order for us to set up some of our own decorations.,She stated that we should arrive 15 minutes early so we could get it done in time, we just needed to let the people working the party counter know what we were doing.,Today we arrived 20 minutes early.,We were ignored (along with 2 other groups) for the first 10-15 minutes of us standing there with decorations and balloons in hand, hard to miss us.,We finally got service and at that time were told that we would be able to have the party room at 2pm and the kids would be jumping from 1-2 then from 2:30-3.,We were now stuck with our party decorations for 1 hour, and had no clue that would be our party room time.,They tried to accommodate and gave us a room cart to store our belongings on until it was our time for the room.,My mother, who was now livid, went over and talked to the manager.,He told her that we already new what time we would have the room and it was communicated via email to us prior to the party.,After receiving this information I pulled up the emails sent to me and talked with the manager.,I asked him to show me where in the emails is stated that we would have the party room at 2pm and I do not appreciate basically being called a liar.,He showed me on the email where it states \"Your party has 90 minutes of playtime and 30 minutes in the party room. \" I said I understood how the time would be allotted, but it doesn't state when the party room would be ours.,I said according to what was just told to us was we would get to play for 60 minutes, the party room for 30 minutes, and finish with 30 minutes of play.,He said no you get 90 minutes of play, then 30 minutes in the party room.,I asked how this was possible if our play time started at 1 and the room was ours at 2, that's only 60 minutes.,He was not following.,He then went to the computer and checked and said our party room time would be at 2:30.,I told him to go check the paper where the young woman wrote down 2pm not 2:30.,After a little bit of back and forth in a civil manner he stated that the previous weekend.,He had the same issue.,I stated that the issue would be solved if the wording was \"you will start out with 90 minutes of play followed by 30 minutes of the party room. \" This would have solved the entire issue.,I would have known ahead of time when we would have the room and I could have let the elderly guests we had arrive later into the party. .,Once this was all taken care of we were off to the party.,The place is too packed.,I understand wanting to make as much money as possible, to have the place as packed as it is was very unsafe.,They need to have a certain head count then stop people from coming in until a later time.,Since you can continue to buy more time it is imperative to keep track of how many people are there.,The kids that supervise the area do not do a very good job.,This is the 4th time we have been to this location and every time it is the same thing.,No supervision, older kids being too rough with the young kids, and too many people for anyone to truly supervise. .,During our 90 minutes of play there is no offering of beverages to the kids as they are playing.,With the amount of money you pay for a party there is no reason free carafes of water are not offered to the birthday party guests.,Instead we spent an additional $60 to have beverages for the children and parents in our party. .,During the party session we found the rooms to be extremely uncomfortable and warm.,The girl helping with the party was not much help.,We ended up serving most of the pizza to our guests along with the beverages.,She was very helpful with serving the cake though which I feel was only because she wanted to hurry it along.  30 minutes is NOT enough time to eat, open gifts and have cake.,The manager told my mom he suggests gifts be opened at home.,Why wouldn't the birthday child open their gifts in front of the guests?,Once you are in the party room it is just a rushed and stressful situation because of the \"time limit\".  .,The plusses are the facility is great for kids 11 and under.,There is a lot for them to do and have fun in an indoor environment to help keep them cool while being active.","Gave Fatbobs pizza a try tonight.,Overall my family found the pizza to be average to below average.,For the high price we thought it would be better.,There are many other pizza places in Brunswick with better pizza for a lower price.","Great Mom and Pop lunch spot in Scarborough.,Think what would happen if a sandwich and a pizza had a baby.,Thats Mamajoun!!","Got the buffalo chicken pizza and it was pretty good except the excessive and thick ranch that was over the top and salty, drowning out any buffalo taste.,I had to wipe half of the sauce off and the pizza tasted much better.,The crust is great just like most brick oven pizzas.,I ordered their $9 farm veg salad and that's was disappointing.,From the description and the price, I thought I would be getting a large variety of garden fresh vegetables but sadly not so.,It was mainly lettuce with shaved carrots and radish. . . that was it.,Where are the beets, tomatoes, corn, broccoli, etc?,So unsatisfying.,Definitely a side salad.,Could have tossed in some nuts at least to spruce it up.","The service was super slow.,They had MAYBE 5 people inside and another 15 outside and we had to wait close to an hour for our pizza we NEVER got.,Wouldn't suggest if you're hungry.","It's the perfect snack during the night if you get hungry.,Good pizza.,Portion is huge.","This was our 2nd visit to this location, the first after they just opened. .,We came in around 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon, not too busy as we were sat in less than 10 min.,My wife and I decided to get the stuffed deep dish pizza, we always enjoy their thin crust so we thought this should be good.,As we were ordering the waitress told us the deep dish can take up to 45 mins to bake, since we weren't sure we wanted to wait that long, we told her to make it a thin crust.,She then told us it would be 30 mins for a thin crust!?,So we decided for an extra 15 mins we would stay with the deep dish. .,Over an hour later the pizza was finally delivered to our table and we were both starving.,After a couple of bites, we both looked at each other and remarked how hard and thick the crust was! I was nearly impossible to cut it with a knife! Not only hard but absolutely no flavor to it.,We ended up just eating the filling out of our slice which was good.,We both did not want any more! When our waitress came back, she said that the manager wanted to buy us dessert for our wait but we literally lost our appetite from the pizza.,We may go back again but never will order that pizza again, yuck!","This was the worst pizza I have ever had.,The cheese and sauce had both a sour taste and smell.,The crust was bland and hard.,The price was right at $3. 99 so I gave it a try instead of going to a pizza franchise. . . but it was too horrible to eat.","Thin crust pizza done correctly in the oven and a host of nice wines.,The only crap thing was the music.,Didn't go with the environment at all.,Since I'm moving to this hood a year from now will go back.,Amazing pizza.","We came in with a Groupon and sadly were told that even though the fine print had no exclusions, we could only order a pizza.,I was hoping to order a pizza and a calzone or hoagie and pay the difference.,But nope it was pizza only on weekends even though the place was empty and we were getting carryout.,I did want want to argue with the abrupt person taking our order. .,The pizza itself was quite good.,We ordered the pesto chicken.,Without groupon I never would have known about this place which is quite close to Robinson Mall.,I no longer live in the Burg but come here often and would return .,But shucks, why wouldn't you let me get a calzone!  Incidently the 3 star rating is the average of 4 for the pizza and 2 for the service.,Never understand why a person in the restaurant business can't be pleasant and if you don't like Groupon then don't offer it.","Authentic NY style pizza. . .,Mmmm :-)","After waiting almost a decade to share my favorite pizza with my parents I now know I should have kept waiting.,I expected a bit of a line but I was rushed through checking and They were onto the next customer before my family could ask about pre ordering.,Luckily a while later we heard some one else pre ordering so we did it too being told to pre order our deep dishes only.   45 minutes after ordering we were seated , just a few minutes late.   .,We ordered appetizers since they quoted an hour and a half for deep dishes.,And ordered a child's pizza and my father who loves pizza ordered his favorite pizza pepperoni asking the waiter which pizza he could order to be out no later than our deep dishes.,He got a thin crust. .,Our deep dishes didn't come out until we had been seated for over an hour, it took almost another hour for the KIDS menu pizza and the thin crust.,We were there over 3 hours.,OH and to top it off when the final pizza arrived it had no pepperoni on it.,Instead covered in olives which he hates.   .,I regret going there and feel embarrassed at telling them years how much I love this place.,The servers were scrambling the whole place was behind while a non stop of carry outs and delivery were being paraded out the door.,Save yourself the trouble of relying on their service.,Just get a delivery if you must eat their food or better yet get a frozen one mailed from Chicago as this place doesn't deserve your money until they can meet the expectations they set. . \"We swear 10 more minutes max and it's out\" waited another 20. .,This place doesn't deserve to wear the name.","Some of the best food I have ever had. . .,BBQ chicken pizza was great and Rachel's burger was excellent.,The best onion rings I have ever eaten.,Here's a beginner tip, try the strawberry lemonade.,How good is the food here?,Sometimes we travel up from Tucson just for a taste.,Also every time we ate in Phoenix we make sure and stop.,You will not be disappointed.","This review is for their location on 10431 N. 19th Ave, Phoenix, AZ  60-997-1007.,Me and my office mate finally tried this location - we both ordered hot subs.,I got the Ham and Cheese and she ordered the Turkey Breast.,I LOVED this sandwich, the bread they use is very tasty - perfect crunch after being heated.,Ham/Cheese and all he fixins were perfect in my book.,I will go back and try the pizza by the slice.,I also like their fries - seasoned steak fries. .,This location is in a very small and old strip mall next to a dollar store.,Inside is very clean and staff is friendly.,We went during lunch hours and it wasn't too busy.,Very filling and the sandwich size and flavor was perfect and i thought the cost was reasonable.","I waited for four hours in the blistering cold and asked for crushed red pepper and you still said no. . . the pizza is pretty shitty man they had no pepperoni pizza he likes it more than I do. . .,I ain't that mad but I just don't like getting diabetes.,The customer service was good nothing bad to say . . but the pizza tasted like frozen diabetes with sesame seeds.","I went with my friends on a Tuesday night and I have to say, their service was pretty awesome.,Our server was attentive, promptly refilled our empty water containers, and served us food all in a timely manner.,For a table of 8, we didnt wait very long for all of our food to arrive; which was amazing since we didnt have to wait until our food is cold to begin eating. .,Four of us decided to share, so we ended up getting quite a few selections from their menu.,Their calamari and polentas were extremely well done, I loved the chili oil dipping sauce the calamari came with.,The bruschetta was good, and the buratta was a very interesting app (it was the first time ive tried this).,I probably would order the spicier version of it to try next time I come back.,The pastas we ordered were all very delicious.,I highly recommend the shrimp spaghetti, the sauce was beautifully done with plenty of tender shrimp on the side.,The poor man's parmesan was crunchy on top, making every bite an experience. .,The only thing I did not enjoy was the diavolo pizza.,The balsamic vinegar was wayy too strong, it was all i could taste when I bit into it.,I could barely finish 1 slice. .,Overall it was a very enjoyable experience, I would definitely come back to dine again.,On a side note our server was awesome as she split the bills perfectly for us without mistakes.,Bonus!! :)","Was excited to try location closer to us.,Went in on non busy weeknight last week.,Server was very quiet, couldn't hear her and not much of a people person.,Put in an order for pasta for my hungry daughter with oil and garlic and she brought out plain spaghetti and told me oil and cheese are on the table. 20 mins later I asked if her meatballs were coming out.,Oh I forgot to put them in.,No apology or here let me grab them at no charge.,So we just forgot about them.,Had to ask me what beer my husband ordered again cause he was in bathroom and she forgot.,Never came around to ask if he wanted another drink but manager finally did.,First and second half of pizza came out almost cold.,Couldn't guess why on that.,Only two tables of two and one table of 8 at the time.,Leftover pizza thrown on paper plates and in a brown paper bag with nothing covering them.,Will not return would rather drive extra distance to Scottsdale or just go to Pomo downtown Gilbert!","We are here today for my birthday and everything was great.,We got seated very quickly and had a very friendly waitress named Lucy.,Our food was amazing!

The taste and amount of cheese and sauce were perfect and the garlic knots delish as well, but not the best I'm sorry.,I will be back no doubt if I am in the area and the price is great especially for the size. . .,I would even say top 5 but no blue ribbon.","Good East Coast Style Pizza.,They cook the crust till golden brown.,The sauce is good and not overpowering.,For a change, order Eggplant as a topping.,They fry it first before it goes on the pizza.,Adds a nice flavor to a veggie pie.,While not cheap, the pie is a good value.","Hey Sauce! .,I heard some friends talking about how great your pizza was so I took the wife out to your restaurant last night to give it a try.,I thought I'd provide you with our feedback as I have a feeling many other people may be feeling the same way we did about our experience.,Lets start off with the good, the pizza was really good, our server was really good, the price of the food was decent, but that's kind of where it ends.,Our first real impression of the place was when we were handed our menu's, both our menu's were beyond greasy and dirty and had food stuck to them, they were dingy/had bent corners and some of the paper had ripped off both of the menus this is a sign that nobody cares to wipe down the menus, and if nobody cares to even wipe down the menus it makes me wonder what else do they not wipe down regularly.,When sitting around and taking in the whole atmosphere of the place, we felt it was a little dark and the restaurant as a whole needed to be wiped down.,The garlic knots were really good, I still have mixed feelings about them, because most places that sell garlic knots dust them in parmesan cheese powder and some sort of garlic powder, and that's what I was kind of expecting here, but here I got fresh parmesan cheese and fresh chunks of garlic on top, don't get me wrong fresh is great but it was an ongoing battle to keep the garlic chucks and parmesan on top of the knot while eating it, where as if it were the parmesan powder I feel it would have stuck better and not have been so much work.,The sauce that came with the garlic knots was amazing.,Normally I like my garlic knots dipped in ranch, but I definitely liked your sauce over ranch last night.,As far as your pizza goes it's really good.,Let me start by saying I haven't found a place in the Vegas area that does pizza like yours, the thickness of the dough etc.,We are transplants from California a little over a year ago and we've been on the hunt for a pizza with a crust like that.,That's how 90% of all pizza places are in Southern California do it so that's what we've grown to like.,Everything we have tried out here has seemed to try to spin off of New York thin style crust, so thank you for being a breath of fresh air for that.,The pizza was hot when it came out as it should have, but for the life of me every slice I ate all the toppings would slide right off the crust, i felt like i might as well be eating a pizza casserole lol I thought that maybe everything was just too hot, but from the time I ate my first slice to the time I ate the last one, a good 15 minutes had passed and still the same situation.,In regards to your soda glasses, you are using Samuel Adams pint glasses I think they were, these things were very frustrating, first of all not everyone likes beer and if you want to attract more families to your restaurant having every soda glass be a beer pint isn't very family friendly, but the most annoying part is every time I had a refill (at least 3 times) the ice was stuck in that center section and would drop to the bottom of the glass, just something to think about.,Over all I liked the food, but all the other issues combined really make me want to rate you as 2 out of 5 stars.,I was really hoping your restaurant would be added as a \"usual place\" for my wife and I but I think it's going to be in the once in a blue moon category.,I hope business continues to grow for you guys and that you can dial down these little things and thrive as a business.,Thanks again for the good food last night and good luck!","Always stop here when in Pittsburgh. . .,Love the Italian wedding soup. .,Great pizza!!

TERRIBLE","We ordered on a Wednesday at around 5:30 pm.,The order arrived by 6 and was fresh and hot.,It was, however, missing the potato wedges which we called the store about.,They were redelivered about 45 minutes later.,After calling about the wedges (which my daughter really wanted, so she didn't eat), we realized one of the pizzas was missing half the toppings.,Decided not to call.,The online ordering was good but does not allow for 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas.,Not really family friendly. .,Sorry Pizza 73, not gonna order again.","This place is kind of really awesome.,We arrived right when they seemed to get busy for lunch but the place is huge so there is no need to worry about not getting a table.,Upon entering, the host gave us a card and explained how the whole restaurant worked.,You take your card up to the station you want (they are labeled) and order.,From there, they scan your card and give you a little beeper to tell you when your food is ready.,There are two bars, one at the front and one at the back where the same card concept applies.,I ordered the bruschetta pizza and antipasti plate while the other people in my party ordered pasta carbonara and a chicken panini (can't remember exactly what kind).,With your meal, they give you bread and there is oil and balsamic at the table.,Overall, food was very good and I loved the atmosphere.,The only issue I saw with the whole thing was that people could walk out without paying for their meal.,I even asked the woman checking me out how they dealt with that and she didn't have an answer or solution to it yet.,Definitely worth trying because it's pretty good Italian food that's fast!","We stayed at the quality inn near the universities and wanted some pizza.,Found this place on yelp.,Great NY style pizza.,Family owned so they want customers to be pleased.,You can get a simple garden salad for $3 and a chef salad for $3. 50.","Tried this place late last night.,Got 2 XL Pepperoni Pizzas for $15 even.,Pretty good deal, I think! And now we have plenty of leftovers for a few days. .,There's not a whole lot of places to sit there, but I think they do mostly pick-ups anyway.,Employees were friendly and polite.,They had a nice big tv there for people to watch while waiting and they keep the a/c running so it's not hot like you'd think a pizza place would be. .,I saw someone eating a Philly Cheese Steak and it looked and smelled delicious.,I want to try that next, it's only like $5 with fries. .,The pizza was good and greasy, in the right way.,It reminded me of the pizza I had the first time I went to New York City, it was a place right off Times Square.,Anyway, Sofia's pizza was yummy.,It tasted very fresh and just plain yummy.,The crust was good and thin but not crispy and the sauce tasted like actual fresh tomatoes.,Pepperoni was. . . pepperoni. lol.,I'm sorry, nothing out of the ordinary there. .,Our dog really, really liked the pizza.,It was pretty ridiculous the way she whined until we gave her some.,Usually she doesn't make a peep. .,So there's that.","The cobra team really enjoyed the stay.,We had a three bedroom suite (could of been a 4 bedroom but the hotel couldn't find one available so two of our team had to be on a different floor. ) Ours was a two bedroom suite with a additional attached room.,Perfect for the team.,We had a great gathering spot, with a central kitchen area , which a amazing place to pregame and snack.,They had a projection for TV in the living room.,Plus a pull out couch.,A con is that they took out the ovens *we bought pizzas to bake* which was a recent reduction due to a few headaches the hotel had with drunk cooking. . .,The beds where conformable and the team really felt refresh, even the soldiers who slept on the pull out quite enjoyed it.,Bathrooms were spacious and clean. .,Just like jon p.,Like didn't care for lack of poolside service.,But understanding this wasn't a party hotel, really can't be too negative there.,Pool were a good size and was very sunny which is a plus considering so many others are dwarfed by other hotels. .,Overall this place is a great choice for large teams.,Such as the Commanders Crew of 10.,I would come here again for that reason.","Left me upset enough to create a yelp account. customer service is just important to me as food.,I can't really comment on the food but I wanted to share my experience using their delivery service.,I found this place here on yelp.,Looking forward to finding a new place for pizza.,I place my order online.,I was called within minutes to confirm the order, they told me it was going to be an hour.,I said no problem and waited. . after an hour nobody showed up. .,I called to get a status.,They simply said sorry its already out for delivery.,Thinking it may show up any minute I waited. . . . another 30 mins later still nothing.,Im only a mile away.,Called again same ol story they gave me an insincere apology, which is why I didn't want to wait any longer.,Im starving and can't leave because they are still on the way. . . maybe??,With making no effort to earn a new customer just seem they rather get me off the phone to take more orders.,Having to repeatedly call with no kinda real info or eta when ill ever get my food.,I canceled my order and went to find somewhere else to eat.,Which defeated the reason why I wanted delivery.,If I had knew it would be this frustrating or this long I wouldn't have ordered.,They are quick to charge my card but getting food another story.,Im sure they have wonderful food but ill never know.,They have left a bad taste in my mouth.,So if you give them a chance don't make it for delivery.","I ordered one small pizza and one medium pizza directly off their menu with no special additions.,That is not what was delivered to my door.,This was late on a monday night too.,Not like some busy weekend rush or dinner hour to get in the way.  .,The real frustration came in trying to fix the order.,After calling the place three times, I was put on hold, hung up on, unable to talk to the same person twice, major communication issues, and not once offered an apology or way to fix this.,They really need to work on the customer service.,Over two hours later I was left with two small pizzas totaling $ 35. .,While I can't vouch for the actual taste of the pizza since I ended up with plain cheese, the service sucks.,This place just lost my business.,Not worth the hassle.,I wish the best of luck to the rest of you!","Food is usually up to par.,My only gripe is wait times.,Hot n ready means. . . . hot and ready.,Theyve told me if i need more than 2 pizzas to call ahead.,Which isnt often. . . i needed 3 once and had a wait.,So not bad.,If pizza is ready tho, breadsticks arent.,I usually order 2 $6 xtra most bestest and 2 breadsticks.,I always end up waiting.,At least 10-20 min.,Very rare i walk in and right back out.,Hitting it before 5pm helps.,I havent had any complaints about their food from the fam.,Huge plus.,Pretty consisent.,I miss their cheesy bites.,Those were awesome.,This location doesnt have a high turn around either.,Alot of the employees ive seen for quite some time and are pleasant.,If it werent for high wait time, this would be 5 star.","We got our first takeout tonight.,Pizza for my husband and grilled chicken club salad for me.   .,First - the food was ready to go in 15 min - had to leave right after ordering.,I was a bit worried that this would mean it was not fresh.,WRONG.   Salad was huge - and very fresh.,The chicken was even warm.,The pizza was terrific as well.  .,Cannot comment on how it is to dine in but we will be trying it out!","We ordered after EDC last night, we got home and were starving and found their menu slipped under the door of our hotel room, it took over an hour to arrive, then when it got here it was 1 pizza short and we had 1 extra two-liter bottle of Pepsi. .,When we had ordered, the woman on the phone when we ordered, repeated our order back to us and it did include only 1 Pepsi and 3 pizzas instead of the two we got. .,I told the delivery guy we didn't order two bottles and he just gave me attitude and said: \"It's what the receipt says, it's just $3 more\". .,I didn't care that it was just $3 more, my point was we did not want two Pepsi's. .,Then when we called to complain the woman on the other end of the line also had a shitty attitude saying it wasn't their fault that they took the order wrong and that they're just human, mistakes happen. .,They told us we could get the pizza we were missing but we would have to return the extra Pepsi and pay the remainder of the cost of the pizza plus it would take another hour to arrive. .,Worst service and attitude ever.","Just got back! This is the third time in a row that pizza was burnt.,Not only mine but several others as well.,Also the Garlic Knots burnt.,Such a shame.,I do not think I will be going back to this place now.,How one cannot tell when something is burnt is beyond me.,Again this was the third time in a row.,Heck, even the other person sitting at another table said their fries were burnt as well. . .,OPEN YOUR EYES before you have no more locals coming!!!","Okay so if you want great pizza on south side go here.,Not a disappointment.,Slices are huge! It's BYOB. Low key spot and great pizza.,Service was great too, very nice.,Also a good place when you leave the bars at 2am and want a slice to take home.","I like to try different pizza places . . having worked at pizza shops for a few years I have a pretty good gauge on decent pizza.,I can tell you this pizza was very good , solid ingredients and the dough was excellent, obviously made fresh which is very important .,Keep up the good work .","Fresh and simple food.,Best pizza I have had in 4 months.,Staff is really friends and cares about quality.,Nothing trendy here.,Just a great product served by great people.","Oh so good.,My husband loves the panzerotti and I love a simple pepperoni pizza.,Such good taste and a nice change from the typical chains.,Great little hidden gem in Ajax!","Update: The manager sent us a gift card to try out Giodano's again.,Completely different experience tonight.,The food and service were much better.,The waiter wrote down our orders and they were mostly right.,One pizza was missing jalapenos on half and the other pizza had mushrooms which were not requested.,Either way, they tasted great.,The cheese was melted and the crust was not soggy.,The wait was not as bad as last time either (they were not as busy).,The waiter checked on us regularly and refilled drinks when needed.,After tonight's experience, I would be open to coming back. .,Hint for leftovers: Use a small amount of oil in a non-stick skillet and fry them for 2-3 minutes prior to putting them in the oven, it keeps the crust from getting hard and chewy!","Great service and super balls! We had apes pepperoni pizza, veal sandwich and rice balls.,Everything was amazing, topped off with great personal touch.","What a freak show.,Waited for a pizza order and watched the counter guy getting his neck and cheeks rubbed by another guy who was wearing a grey coat and was obviously not working there at the time.,Another employee start laughing and a fight broke out behind the counter.,They carried the guy in the grey coat out the door and he was swearing up a storm.,The guy he punched eventually waited on me.,I don't know who owns this place but they need to know what happened and what a bunch of misfits are working there.,Great food.,Creepy employees.,Keep the recipe, get new help.,Others witnessed this crap.,Happened on Thursday around 7:30 pm.,Never again.","The food here is amazing! If you can find it.,This place was a little hard to find if you have never been here before.,The sign is not where the restaurant is.,We almost went home because we thought they had gone out of business or something.,As we were heading back toward the freeway we thought we would just swing around back and there is was hiding behind some giant trees.,I am so happy we found it.,I got the regular burger and fries and it was super yummy and fresh.,I also got the dark chocolate milk shake and it was out of this world!!! Even the cherry on top looked like they had marinated it themselves.,My husband got the special, which was some kind of fried pork chop sandwich.,My daughter got the pizza, which I tried and it was delish.,If you have time take a stroll over to the community garden and look at the plots.,Or hope in your car and drive through the darling neighborhood that surrounds the restaurant.","Being from Chicago, I love trying local Pizza companies that serve Chicago Style Pizza.,Oregano's recently opened another restaurant on Bell Road in Glendale and I could not be happier.,I went in for the first time a couple days ago, and the staff was extremely nice.,I ordered a Pan Pizza to go and it was fantastic.,My dad heated up the leftovers the next day and said it was the \"best next day heated up pizza\" he ever ate.,Love it!!!","We have been going to RWB since it opened, about 14 years ago.,My husband says they have the best pizza and that is what we usually order but everything I have ever had there great.,We had introduced many friends to their eatery and all love it.,In the winter time the winter visitors usually have it really crowded from late afternoon to well after dinner time.","This is a local restaurants it's always very busy the staff and the owners are wonderful it's been in the neighborhood for about 20 years staff is always very attentive portions are large food is delicious the garlic Parmesan rolls are delicious we love everything that we get here normally on Fridays after 430 usually have a wait there's open seating in the bar tables are small but you can make them do if you're in a hurry they serve lots of fish dinner is here but the restaurant never smells like fish every single time we come we have a great time I would highly recommend this restaurant you can call ahead and pick up a delicious pizza if you don't have time to cook for dinner they also make a ton of salads The pizza roll is huge feeds three people easily my favorite is the meatball chicken wings outstanding taste like they were delivered from Buffalo New York  it's nice to have such a great restaurant in the neighborhood highly recommended","Definitely a nice space.,Open.,Well appointed.,Tried it for lunch.,Two of sat at bar.,Crowded but we got there at 12:30 after the rush. .,Bartender brought us water but did not take a drink order.,When we finally got her attention we asked about the food since it is a complicated menu.,They seem to be excited about their pizza but have their own lexicon and she did a poor job of explaining, but in her defense there is a lot to explain and it was busy.,Manager standing around watching instead of helping.,Back to reading menu.,Decided to just get the pizza special. .,Beer came.,Very short pour.,When I questioned I was told it was a higher alcohol beer so, like many places, it was an eight ounce poor in a snifter.,Ok. But I poured out water glass and poured in beer and at best it was a six ounce poor.,At best.,Additionally, they are charging $8  for that small pour for a mid-range local craft beer. .,Then we were told the kitchen was backed up and the wait would be at least 30 minutes.,Time to leave. .,Bartender talked to the manager and came back and offered some cheese curds but we were already heading out.,Paid for the drinks snd left. .,Bartender at least tried, earning the two stars and maybe a trip back. .,Nice, but seems pretentious, over priced and under managed.","Completely awful.,Ordered a pizza and it took 1 hour and 15 minutes and the place was only 1/4 busy and they got it wrong TWICE.  We didn't realize the 2nd screw up until we got home.,We assumed after the 1st screw up and apology they'd get it right.,The bartenders were dancing like they wanted to have fun but paid zero attention to our order.,WILL NEVER GO BACK.","Order came cold and incorrect.,Ordered off Grubhub.,No fault with Grubhub.,Won't order pizza from this restaurant again."],"x_coord":{"__ndarray__":"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","dtype":"float32","shape":[486]},"y_coord":{"__ndarray__":"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
