title: Bert Sentence Embeddings
subtitle: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
---

## Document Similarity

The goal of this project is to create a context aware model for topic modeling. Traditional NLP methodologies lack the capacity to differentiate a word used for different purposes.

## Bert Model

* Huggingface pre-trained model released by Google that ran for many, many hours on Wikipedia and Book Corpus, a dataset containing +10,000 books of different genres

* can use these models to extract high quality language features from your text data, or you can fine-tune these models on a specific task 

### Yelp data/preprocessing

* Subset reviews to those containing restaurante businesses and have the word pizza in the review.

* Split each review into one sentence segements, tokenize each sentence into bert format and convert to tensors representations

### Limitations of Bert

* Bert is limited to 512 characters

* Pretrained hugging face model is tuned for next sentence predictions 

* Used 2nd to last layer of pretrained Bert model on each sentence of a review

### Innovation for this project

* Concatenated each sentence embedding into a single tensor

* Averaged concateated embeddings (have heard of first and last chunks of sequence and text summarization to reduce the text to 512 limit)

the heart of Chinatown, I discovered it enroute to Kensington Market one day. It's quite hard to see, if you don't know it's there. First experience was very positive - would definitely return!. ATMOSPHERE: Small space. Think Banh Mi Boys, and other trendy over-the-counter eateries. Vibe is casual. Free WiFi is nice. . SERVICE: Okay. Staff does their job, but not overly helpful upon entering the space. Maybe because it's an over-the-counter style place, but it would have been nice to be walked through their ordering process and menu. . PRICE: Average. Depends on the size of pizza you order. The small pizza ($7-9. 50) is filling for one. Large size pizza ($13-18. 50) is good for sharing. . . or one VERY hungry person. Pasta portions are very generous for the price tag ($9-14). . FOOD: My friends and I were here for the first time, and we thought it was a pizza place so we all ordered pizza. It wasn't until we were waiting for the food to come, that we looked around and realised EVERY other table around us only had pasta on them. Guess we gotta come back to try! We did notice that the menu said their pasta is homemade. So will definitely come back. . Here's the pizza we ordered:. Peking Duck Pizza - Very tasty! Rich flavours that work well. But it's heavy, so come hungry - or order to share. . Margherita - Good, but not the best. I recommend trying the more \"special\" toppings instead. . Shall return, and/or try other locations.","First time eating there and everything was so yummy! Great pizza and Salad, my son had the meatball sub he said it was very good, must have been because he wouldn't share. Highly recommend.","There wasn't one specific thing that made this buffet so horrible. . . It's just the accumulation of everything being less than average quality. There are plenty of options, but none of them were flavorful, hot, or worth filling up on. . Some others have commented on the dessert section being worthwhile, but to us everything tasted unthawed and on the stale side. The Asian section had probably the best offerings but all were still fairly bland. . The worst part is that when I was going to grab a slice from the pizza station, someone had placed the tongs directly on TOP of the pizza. . . So all the hand germs were in direct contact with the food! There were two workers right there who didn't think this was disgusting. . I would have discarded the slices. . My husband and I both left with unsatisfied stomachs and looked forward to the second dinner we would have a few hours later at a much better establishment.","Was super excited to bring my boyfriend to this Scaddabush location after going to the Richmond Hill location months back with friends and have been craving their mozzarella balls ever since! . We arrived and were seated at 8:15, and since reviewing the menu before hand, we placed out order with our waitress right away. We ordered the 'Naked' mozzarella to start and for mains the Penne Bolognese and Margherita pizza. . The waiting game was okay, we got our appetizer about 25 mins of waiting. Once arriving, the first thing I noticed was how small the mozzarella ball was compared the he Richmond Hill location. However, it was delicious ! I was reminded on why I chose this restaurant for dinner. . As for the mains, we waited and waited and waited. We had seen a male (possibly manager?) walk around with pizza slices and deliver them to some tables, however not ours. As he went to the table next to us we could overhear him apologizing for the wait time for their meals. . At around 9:05 our meals did arrive. The pizza was good,  definitely not enough cheese but will do. My boyfriend did really like his pasta. . Overall, I would say I would come back to Scaddabush. Possibly just for the mozzarella balls but as our mains were just okay and nothing special, wouldn't choose this location for a full dinner again.","So I don't give out 5 stars frivolously, but this place deserves it. Everything I had (summer rolls, vegan pizza burger and chocolate chip cookies) was delicious. The service was great and the waitress helped me narrow down the never ending yummy looking options on the menu. They even gave me a smoothie sample while I waited. . Next time I'm in Cleveland, I'll definitely stop back in. I may even be coming for dinner today.","More than just  Pizza. This location is small but cozy. Has two large screen TV's for your entertainment pleasure. . The pizza is of better quality than most (a definate step up from Pizza Hut and Domino'). The thin crust is we like here. The crust has a crunch to it, which I prefer. Their menu has a \"tailgate\" variety of food (Pasta, Ribs, Fried Chicken, sub sandwiches. . . . . . you get the picture). . The prices are bit high for what you get. They do have specials so that is what our family typically goes for. . . . . Familiy Feast ($22) includes 16' pizza with one topping, 6 wings, 4 garlic sticks, and 2 liter of pop. . We are planning to keep this place on our list of places to think about  for a weekday \"too many kid activities\" and \"too tired to cook\" take out night.","I ordered a pizza at 4:49. Got an email that said my pizza would be delivered at 5:18 to5:28. 5:38 still no pizza. Called the store. They said it was out for delivery. I said I knew that it was suppose to be delivered 10 minutes ago. 5:48. Still no pizza. Called the store back. Again, I was told it was out for delivery. 5:48 called the store again. When I was on the phone the pizza came. When it arrived it was COLD.","My absolutely favorite mushroom pizza in the city, Great brunch spot - really reasonable and you can always get a table, because it's really big and has indoor and outdoor space. I think the ice cream is homeade. A neighbourhood favorite!","2015 St. Patrick's Day Festival highlights: Saturday morning parking was available for free at 1) Parking Garage near City Hall, located at Basic Road and Lead Street. Accessed from Basic Road and 2) Parking Garage near Justice Facility, located at Water Street, near Basic Road. Accessed from either Water Street or Texas Avenue. . A must see is the  Carrolier Academy of Irish Dance! The children participated in the parade and scheduled events throughout the weekend. Led by Debbie Carroll and Shelley Locklier, the two dancers have Irish dance teaching credentials; both teachers travelled the world with Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance. . Fun for the children included the ferris wheel and carousel. Since the Las Vegas Valley does not have a permanent ferris wheel and carousel to ride, we enjoyed taking a twirl on both. Ferris wheel tickets were 4 tickets per person. Carousel tickets were 3 per person, but an adult is free if standing next to small children who are on the ride. Each ticket = $1. 25. . I would like to see a greater use of food trucks. We saw pizza, Mexican, Filipino, hot dogs, cupcakes, and snowcones. Come on Las Vegas Valley food culture, come out and show us what you offer.","The pizza wasn't very warm when it arrived (they didn't use the warming bag at time of delivery) and the order was wrong, but the pizza tasted good.","The server had an extensive knowledge of wines &amp; their various menu selections and it was clear that we were her top priority. The pizza and dessert were amazing. My only complaint is that the chairs were uncomfortable, I think they could add some more comfortable seating to give this more of a \"wine bar\" feel. Otherwise everything was amazing!","Food was great! Loved the pepperoni rolls and the zamboni fries! Service was sub par. They hustled at first; however the server entirely forgot our pizza. When we inquired, she proceeded to blame it on the kitchen. She never apologized, nor did she offer a discount. She coerced us into paying our tab and did not offer to get us any additional food or beverage. Furthermore, she did not pass on to another server that we intended to stay and eat and drink-even though we explicitly stated that. We stayed for 45 minutes waiting to order more food and have our drinks refilled. Our plates were cleared and we were not offered additional food/drink. No one addressed us. L. Overall: good food, bad service.","When I walked into Epicure Cafe today it was like bizarroland - like when you come home from vacation and sense that everything isn't in its right place. You know you're at home, but someone's moved something, rearranged the furniture, or otherwise changed things ever so slightly but just enough to make you suspicious. This wasn't the Epicure Cafe that I remember from three or four years ago. . I learned from Jackie, our cutesy server who was a total dupe for actress Clea DuVall, that a few years ago Epicure changed locations. To a few doors down farther east on Queen, on the same side of the street. Which explains the slightly-different-but-not-quite layout, decor and seating. It was a pleasant surprise. I didn't venture upstairs but I was told there's an outdoor eating area that will have to be explored on my next visit. . The menu options are, like others have said, a bit overwhelming. But for the fussy eater (I was with one of them) there was no lack of choice - Epicure has everything from pasta (17 choices, including different sauces and shapes), burgers, pizza, wraps and another full page of duck/veal/lamb/chicken options. I appreciate the selection but it could stand to be honed a little! Luckily Jackie was able to recommend favourites when we showed indecision. . My eyes went straight for the Pumpkin Ravioi ($14), which I was assured was \"not a mistake\". And it wasn't. I barely looked up my from my plate as I feasted my eyes on the glorious, pillowy ravioli on my plate. They were seasoned with ginger and nutmeg, tossed in parmesan cream sauce with grilled corn, wilted spinach and mushrooms. The mushrooms were perfectly sauteed, the spinach was wilted just right and the corn was fresh and added the exact amount of crunch that the dish needed. The portion wasn't skimpy either - at some restaurants when you order jumbo ravioli you get 3-4 pieces, but this was more than double the size. Good value for the money. . I was more than tempted by the dessert board (tartufo, ice cream, tiramisu, Grand Marnier cheesecake or cr\u00e8me caramel, Belgian chocolate mousse, apple crumble) but unfortunately dinner left me positively STUFFED. After seeing that Epicure is now open until 1 or 2am every night I know where I'll be heading for late night dessert!","The pizza is very, very good! We arrived 15 minutes before closing time and the restaurant staff were very accommodating!","After making idiot faces through the window at the employees of Spicy Pickle, employees who were most likely tired after a long day of training, my husband and I were invited to lunch the next day- a training activity for the staff. Only friends and family were invited. We felt very special- either to be considered part of the Spicy Pickle family, or maybe because we made such ridiculous fools of ourselves at the window that they thought we might be \"special\" in the other meaning. Perhaps. . Either way, free lunch. . It's not as though I could give a stinky review to anything given to me for free- I might feel bad- but this was just what the doctor ordered. . Not for the weak at heart. . It's not just a clever name. Their pickles are actually spicy. They seems to be lightly dusted with some kind of chile powder. A nice kick follows a good bite. . I ordered the Dilly something or other. It was half a sandwich (sub or panini) with a bowl of soup. I chose the Corn and Green Chile Bisque with the Sausalito Bandito panini. Delish! It also passed my spicy- enough- for- me- test. Yes, I needed multiple napkins for my nose. . I could have taken a little more spice, so next time I might ask them to kick it up a notch, but it was a refreshing foray back to my traveling days when I tried to convince a chef in India that, no, I am actually not white. I just have REALLY light skin. Never worked. . Al had the Aztec pizzeti. Coming from NY, I am particular about pizza. This looked like it fit the bill. Very think and crispy crust. A little too much cheese for my taste, but most people out here like it like that. She loved it, along with her bowl of loaded potato soup. . Mickey had the Gobbler with a side salad. When she bit into the panini she made a face that I think should remain in the bedroom. Enough said. . Bryan had the salad and enjoyed it immensely. It didn't look like much, but I might have to return when they open tomorrow and try it out for myself. The croutons did look very appetizing. . One of the attentive staff members made the rounds with a tray of mini chocolate chip cookies. Fantastic. Crispy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. Mama like. . All in all, I'll be back. Probably tomorrow. And maybe the day after. . . . AMENDMENT:. OK, so I did go back the next day. . . and today (which is the following day). Yesterday I had the tuna salad, which was delish. Theur tuna is a little kicked up, as it's made with chipotle mayo (but really not too much) and spoicy pickle relish. Tasty. It was served over a bed of greens with a lemon olive oil dressing. . Today I had the med sub. It was ok- nothing out of the ballpark. I got it with the spoinach salad, which was also delish. . Down to 4. 5, but alas no halfs. . . . Stick with the paninis and the salads. Maybe the soups too. I have yet to try the pizzetti. . . stay tuned.","This is probably my favorite bar in Pittsburgh. The pizza is solid, the hot dogs are great, and the beer cave. . . mmmm. My only complaint is that they haven't opened another one on the other side of town!","I ordered the much recommended hachapuri and 2 orders of khinkali (dumplings). I gotta say the flavours of Georgian cuisine is quite unique. These dishes seemed to be made to order because it took quite some time to receive. It may have been more than half an hour. . My favorite would be the hachapuri. It makes me think of having pizza but the cheese is distinctly salty and they roll up the boat edges with cheese so the crust is a delight to eat. I wish there were 2 eggs. It definitely balanced the saltiness of the cheese (feta?). It seemed like there were 2 layers of cheese: the crusty top and a layer of soft chese below. . The khinkali reminds me of Chinese dumplings but the flavours are truly very different from what I'm used to. It was creamy and dark. Each serving contained 3 dumplings  which doesn't seem like a lot but it really is like its own meal. It definitely needed something to cut the heaviness. . While waiting for the food, we got complimentary appetizers: bread, pickled cabbage and an array of sauces (tomato, Georgian, spicy). The sauces and the pickled cabbage all have tastes I am not familiar with. I ate it all because the food was taking so long to come. The pickled cabbage I did not like so much. . All in all, the service was good, the food was filling and I was satisfied.","Fast Forward. Every trip from NYC to Pitt includes a visit to Aiello's. And if we know anyone driving East, we request a transfer!. If you are in search of fancy \"gourmet\" pizza, go elsewhere. . At Aiello's, you order the pizza you specify - and it is absolutely perfect!","If I could I could give 0 stars I would. So we show up around 5:30pm on a Monday. Place is pretty empty. Ordered drink which took about 30 mins to get. Ice was already melted in my drink. Ordered apps and meals. We did not get out food until 7:30. We waited a hour and a half for food @ a empty upscale pizza shop. BTW my pizza was cold. And there is some manager guy walking around looking busy but what a joke. Also I ordered a Calzone which was not a Calzone. Crust Chandler Simply Italian is a joke of a place and anyone that waste there money obviously does not care about the food they put in there mouth or any kind of service. What a rip off. Just remember every time someone has a bad experience they tell 10 people. I was with 4 people. That's 50 people in day. I think the major issue is the customer base has no clue what good Italian is. It sad that so many people accept this.","The building is lovely. The remodel after Buttita's is as good as one can do when turning a lovely restaurant into a sports bar-style restaurant (though why one would want to do that is beyond me). And that's where the good stuff stops. . In short, the service and all things related to it were glacially slow; the food, when it arrived, was mediocre at best -- and missing key elements (one whole order, and other parts). This restaurant cannot possibly last if they don't figure out how to greet and serve customers, or get the food that was ordered actually to the tables. . The full story. . Upon arrival, we found a vacant hostess stand, then a long walk down the hall to the dining room along which we saw no one who works there. Luckily, we ran into friends who assured us that we could seat ourselves. . After waiting at our table for some 15 minutes, we used a bit of self-help, and accosted a waitress to ask for some menus. After another 5-7 minutes another waitress finally showed up with menus and silverware. She did not offer water, or to bring us a drink of any sort - just plopped the menus down and disappeared. . Quite some time later, our waitress arrived, apologetically, and took our order. We ordered an appetizer (cheese fries), and three meals: 1 burger (would have been on wheat bread but despite the menu, they had none), one 1/2 ribeye (which the menu says was supposed to be thick, but which was certainly not), that should have come with some interesting sounding twice baked potato casserole, and one individual pizza. My daughter ordered a diet, I ordered water, and my husband ordered a beer. . The water and diet only took about 7 minutes to arrive. . The appetizer might have arrived after another 10, but the food runner carrying the plate of cheese fries tried to deliver them to another table. Having learned he had the wrong table, the lad just took them back to the kitchen. . Eventually, the cheese fries arrived. They weren't as hot as one would like, and for the price, there should have been a LOT more cheese. The fries were no better than I could make using frozen crinkle fries from the grocery. . Within 3 minutes of the appetizer's tardy arrival, some of our food arrived. . The burger (but not the beer), and my steak with vegetable, but no potato casserole, and no pizza. . The waitress arrived, and asked if everything was there, we told her \"no\", and pointed out that we were missing the beer, the potatoes and the pizza. Ten minutes later the beer arrived. . My husband then went up to the window where the pizza would have been put up for a food runner -- no pizza had been ordered. . So. . The steak was fatty, but moderately tasty, if only tepid. The broccoli was cold, the burger was not as good as you can get at, say Hardee's (despite costing twice as much). . We never did get the pizza. Or the potatoes.  . I DID offer to come in as a consulting manager to help them teach the staff how to actually wait tables. . . . . .","Probably one of my favorite pizza places. Food is always good and the brick oven is a nice touch you don't see everywhere.","Are you looking for an organic, unique, and historical restaurant? Than Joes Farm Grill is the place for you. Even if you have simple tastes Joes Farm Grill will have something to suit your needs. It has beautiful decoration, great food and affordable prices, so why not pay a visit. . Joes Farm Grill has a long historical background, with a house originally built in 1966 by the Johnston family. In later years it was decided to turn the farm into a restaurant with its food being home grown or locally brought in. The house development around the farm is Agritopia, and was dedicated to permanent urban farming. In fact if you live in the development surrounding the restaurant you can rent a garden lot to grow vegetables. All of their products are certified USDA organic, and their focus is common food done uncommonly. They feel fresh food taste better and are better for you so why not share all that with the customers. They take the foods taste to a new level with all of the recipes and ingredients. . Joes Farm Grill is delicious, unique and a fun experience. I feel most restaurants are chains and don't have the history behind them like Joes does, and because of this it makes the experience much more special. Knowing your food is organic makes it taste ten times better, and knowing you don't have to spend a fortune for organic makes me want to go again. It's really stands out among most and everyone in the chandler area needs to stop by and visit. . First walking up to the twelve acre masterpiece is like going through a farm, with orange trees covering the path and large oaks surrounding it which gives a beautiful green glow of a garden. It smells fresh and gives you an earthy vive. They are enormous and full of green vegetables that look extremely appetizing. They are covering most of the land and you can walk through them and see your food growing. The building is white with large windows showing the back and the front equally, and the inside has simple decorations with light blue and green accents not to overpower the beauty of the vegetation growing outside. It holds no more than a hundred people and is rather spacious seating. The entire restaurant is very simple with a 60s feel mixed with a futuristic time. I ordered the jumbo breaded shrimp with fries, French toast banana peanut butter sandwich and the barbeque chicken pizza. I went with my sister because the portions are rather large and I could not have eaten it by myself. This was my first time visiting the restaurant and my sisters second. Everything so far was very pleasant and the employees were very nice. No more than ten minutes later our food was ready and it looked and smelt great. We sat down and I tried each dish, starting with the shrimp which were very large. The shrimp was crunchy and juicy and was simple and not overpowering. I thought it tasted very good and wasn't too rich which is a problem I normally find when ordering shrimp. Then I tried the French toast peanut butter sandwiches that surprisingly had strawberry's in it too. This was one of the best tasting things I have ever had! It was a house specialty and lives up to its name. It tasted like a gourmet peanut butter sandwich and was so flavorful and sweet. I had to order another one. Then I tried the barbeque pizza, I liked it but it wasn't my favorite. It was thin crust and slightly burnt, but it did taste good with the cheese and chicken combination. It just tasted like there was too many ingredients on the pizza that overpowered it. The prices weren't that bad either, the shrimp was the most expensive at 14. 99 when I go again I probably won't order this again, just because it wasn't a to die for dish. The peanut butter sandwiches were 10. 99 and I crave these every day it was amazing! Than last the pizza was 12. 99, my sister liked it more than I did so it depends on your taste but I probably will try something else. . The most important part though is the food, and not to leave you hanging was no matter what spectacular. Fresh fries galore. The most appealing part to me was the decorations and the gardens surrounding the place. I think the set up as if you're in a food court is a really interesting concept; you have to throw away your own food on trays, and clean up after yourself. I didn't expect that and I think it's a smart move on the restaurants part. The calm and relaxing atmosphere, and no rush pace is really nice. . I enjoyed Joes Farm Grill and I plan on visiting again. I think the organic concept and urban farming is a really nice thing to hear about in today's society. I feel better knowing I'm eating organic, and knowing there are still places that are going strong with the idea of organic. I hope the success of this restaurant shows others they can do the same. This restaurant meets all my needs as a customer, clean, green and tasty what more could you want.","Stopped by because we saw that the patio had a good amount of people so we wanted to see what was causing the crowd. We we're visiting from California and wanted to try out some AZ brews. . Happy to report that we were satisfied with our choices the night we came in. We also ordered the brussels and bacon pizza. Definitely not your tradition pizza toppings but it was delicious. . Will be back again when we're back in town.","A real cozy spot to grab some Greek. . It's tiny, warm, and feels almost divey, but Crazy Jim's is not a bad place to grab a gyro. I'm not going to say it tastes the most 'authentic', but it is unquestionably satisfying. . It starts with the bread, because if you're not ordering a gyro on your first visit, you're doing it wrong. The pita is T H I C K. Flavorful. Heavy. It serves as a great foundation. The meat is tasty, the toppings are good and have plenty of customizable options. I had warm feta to top mine off, and it was great despite almost being too rich. They are very generous portions. . You can get pizza, beer, and a variety of other dishes at an affordable price, so you've got nothing to lose by giving it a try! . Just be warned that parking is a bit of a pain.","Excellent pizza! I travel a lot and one of my favorite things in different cities is to try a locally owned pizza place. Delivery was right in the timeframe they provided and to my hotel room directly, both my pizza and breadsticks were hot on arrival and the delivery guy was friendly. . The breadsticks came with a really flavorful sauce and themselves were perfectly baked and seasoned. The pizza was just a cheese pizza and the ratio of cheese/sauce/crust was on point and tasted great! . As much pizza as I eat I ought to be considered an expert and if I wasn't leaving town tomorrow I'd be visiting these guys again. Great food. Thank you!","All food is good here I usually get the Italian sub or pizza. Would recommend. Very busy on Friday and Saturday. If you can pick it up usually takes about an hour for delivery. And if you order sides of sauces make sure you get usually they forget to put in my bag.","Really nice, casual bistro feel. Quick and easy spot for a light lunch. Food could be improved. . The shrimp and avocado appetizer could be improved upon - the shrimp was very fresh but it lacked flavor. . The grilled octopus was delicious - nicely charred and savory with the chickpeas and tomato sauce. . The pizza with mushrooms also could be improved upon - the crusty was undercooked and had none of that nice, smoky flavor it should have. . The mushroom pasta looked really good - lots of mixed mushrooms and very moist.","We like the Manhattan Family Feast. $41. 99 for a REALLY big 1 topping pizza, hot wings, fries, and a large salad. I do wish another salad came with it since we're big salad eaters. Good food. Good price. Prompt and courteous service.","best New York pizza in Summerlin and p. o pasta dishes look yummy too!  very friendly staff! please come to LA!","Great restaurant for a date night or to get a different ambiance than the usual PSH here in Ayrsley. Service here has always been fantastic. They always recommend great apps to start and they always have daily drink specials! . This is actually a bit more upscale than you think. I would put this more on the higher end of the double dollar sign. $$. I think it's worth it if you are craving a good steak. . I haven't been able to pull away from any other appetizer other than the hummus &amp; pimento cheese dip dip. The hummus is really good! . Another great go-to if you are here to drink and munch are the flatbreads. They are actually more like little pizzas, not flat at all and very good! Very filling because they are doughy. Finally, when I am craving a great burger, this is my go-to. Trust me on this one.","The pizza was great, but the guys that make it , while we were there they were scratching their heads, taking  their hats off to run fingers through their hair. And one guy that was cutting up something was eating. They need to wash their hands after scratching. Will not be back to this one","I was hungry. My aunt was hungry. Those were the only two reasons I went to this place while out visiting Boulder City. . The pizza portions were ridiculously huge, but y'know, there was nothing special about this place other than its cheap prices. The cheese on my slice was overly greasy and no matter what you do, NEVER order their fries because they're out to make you fat.","If Giordano's is looking to compete with Lou Malnati's, they are going to have to improve their dough recipe. The crust tasted like a flaky hard biscuit which is not pleasant on pizza. Lou Malnati's dough has a wonderful yeasty dough flavor while Giordano's doesn't taste like much at all, same as their garlic parmesan french fries. C'mon give us garlic, we can handle it!. To someone who just shoves food in their face and doesn't overly think about it, Giordano's is fine, but if you consider yourself a pizza buff you will probably be let down after the fourth bite. . Overall Giordano's is not horribly disgusting but it isn't impressive either. They could also stand to hire extra staff to be refilling drinks. . . If you're looking for a truly spectacular pizza, do yourself a favor and go to Grimaldi's.","Place is OK . Met here for happy hour on a Friday! Coronas were $3. 50 and the food was well priced! Got four \" mini chimi's \" for $5 and our group of four people split the Mexican pizza $8 which was large and we had left overs! Place just seems like it has seen better days? They had garbage bags over the stools outside which was odd. Music was odd as well played the grease sound track the. Lil yahty? I would go back just to much on some food and leave.","This is my last stop on the reign of terror of vegan hotspots in downtown Las Vegas. It's a pizza shop in the plaza hotel with a vegan slice called the soho. It's pretty majestic, including spinach, artichoke, and the Daiya cheese we all love. The crust is chewy and delicious. At other times (like daytime) they offer a vegan soft serve in chocolate and vanilla. In my case, my 2am pizza trip also featured a drunk twenty year old hitting on me. Thumbs up!","Fix your store, it is so poorly run that I cannot even go there. There are never pizzas ready, they don't answer the phone to make orders, the employees are rude and condescending and the customers are trash!. Our neighborhood is not this gross but if I was from outside the area, I would think it's the slums. Totally unacceptable, get this store fixed immediately. No excuses. . It also has a foul odor to it. . . the pizza is worth 5 or 6 bucks. . . nothing special just fix your stupid store and standards","Loved the pizza. They had a great selection. Services wasn't bad. The wings are also tasty. It was the breakfast of champions!. ; ^ D","Went for the 1st. time to CPK on the advice of a friend, there were 8 in our party. We were seated at a table that was made for 6, kinda cramped for space, we endured because they said the wait for a bigger table would be 20 min. Although there were 2 areas  bigger than where we sat that were empty.  . Now when your waitress finally shows for drinks (about 5 min) and the first words out of her mouth are.  \"They must think I'm  wonder woman, I already have a table of 7 and a table of 12\". Translated= hey guys, your service is gonna suck but that's not my fault. And it did!!!!. My wife and I split the pepperoni, sasuage and mushroom pizza, obviously  'shrooms are the cheapest ingredient cause that's about all we could find. Pizza was bland, 'shrooms  overpowering and service sacked. If that's what your looking for in a dining experience, then this is the restaurant and location for you. If not  STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Horrible customer service. I have gotten food from here a few times expecting to have a better experience from the last, but I was wrong to hope for that. I once called and they answered \"Hold on\" and just put the phone down. After waiting a few minutes they just hung the phone up. I called back again and they answered \"Hold on\" again. I waited for 5 minutes before they took my order. I asked for their specials and the guy on the phone just says \"Well what do you want to know specials on?\" In a kind of sarcastic tone. We've ordered chicken tenders from here many times and were charged for them but received chicken wings instead. This has happened multiple times. When going back they did not even apologize and  they just took the wings back and made us wait for the chicken tenders to be made. Horrible customer service. The food here is WAY OVER PRICED. The pizza is mediocre. They may use \"fresh ingredients\" but really the crust is the best part of the pizza. Maybe I would have thought the food was better if I received better service. . If you want WAYYYY better NY pizza go to rockos pizza. Way better prices, extremely friendly service, way better EVERYTHING.","There is a large dine-in area that is child friendly with arcade games. The pretezel bites were awesome, hot and soft. The seafood salad was fair. The use imitation crab meat in a creamy base, similar to Neptune salad. My husband enjoyed his pizza, but Angelos in Lakewood is still his favorite. The lady at the counter who took our order was very friendly and helpful. She explained the specials and talked to my husband about their Cruisin' nights.","This hot and ready pizza was definitely not the greatest. The pepperoni is clustered around the center. The sauce has a spicy kick to it, and neither my children not myself liked it. The crazy bread is tasty though.","If you're in the area and have a hankering for pizza, head on over to the five50. Let's call this place a 3. 5. Midwesterners beware, this is a thin crust pizza joint!. We were pressed for time and had a 30 to 40 minute window for eating. The service was accommodating, and they got us in and out just in time. We ordered one pizza, half North Beach half Margherita. The slices were large and thin, so one pizza was enough to make two people full at three slices per person. The pizza was thin crust, but still had a slight chew to go with the crunch which I enjoyed. The North Beach had smoked mozzarella and clams on it, and was described as bbq chicken pizza with the chicken swapped for clams. It was unique with tender clam pieces, but I think they planted a dangerous seed since I found myself wishing it had a dash of bbq sauce! The Margherita pizza was nothing special, just a big basil leaf on each slice.","NFL football on and I'm listening to Casey Kasum tip hits from 1978. What is the target demographic? This isn't the only time I left due to terrible ambiance. I'll keep  giving this place a chance because of the happy hour pizza and wings. I hope they will find an identity.","They have such good pizza. OMG their cheesecake is to die for literally. I think I am addicted to the cheesecake.","In a world gone mad there is very little someone can hold on to as true, as right, as constant. Rex Marvin is that person. Rex Marvin's search for the greatest food and the most huffable gasoline makes him the tragic figure that in literature would get the girl, save the day, and have the most severed heads in jars in his basement (if it was a Disney book). The good news people, is that all of those things in real life are true. If you consider a graveside ditch near the freeway to be a \"basement\". Rex does. Recently, Rex was accosted for no reason. Rex and his woman, Three Legged Midget Maggie, were minding our own business. Rex was casually tossing TLMM up in the air until she was able to grab onto a ledge and let herself in. Rex tossed her and she didn't come down. A sure sign that TLMM has accomplished her mission. Rex turns around to have 4 metro cops staring at him. They were big. They were not smiling. Rex decided to break the ice. Rex asked \"How many buy one get one free garden hose or industrial blacktop sealant coupons does it take to get 4 cops to walk away and pretend like they saw nothing?\" The next thing Rex knew he saw flashes of light. Rex smiled. Darkness. Rex woke up on the floor of a squad car while the cops talked about the loser they beat and were taking into custody. It must have been someone else. . Rex's left eye was shut but he saw that they had stopped at a gas station. They talked about food. They were getting gas station pasta. The smaller one looked back to check on Rex, and said that he was in the mood for \"frozen noodles in sauce\". Rex closed his eyes and tried not to vomit at the idea. He felt with his food that the back door wasn't closed all the way. Rex dislocated his wrists, slipped off the cuffs, and pushed the door open. . . and much like the time Rex woke up in Candice Bergen's bedroom. . . he was out before something that could never been taken back happened. Not going to jail. . . no Rex can do hard time. . . but smelling heated frozen pasta is something that Rex will not endure. Rex has endured more than most. Remember, Rex lived in drag as Jodi Foster's lesbian lover for 3 years. . . Rex HAS ENDURED! Still everyone has a line not to cross. One of Rex's is frozen pasta. . . the other is participating in the underground black market 8 track tape racket. . . lucrative, but Rex only needs to lose 3 toes to know that some money just isn't worth it. Rex has brains. . Rex needed to cleanse himself from the memory of that awful experience. . . so Rex ran. He crawled. He climbed into someone's trunk. He eventually reached the closest place he could find. . . Manhattan Pizza. It is in a strip mall behind a bank and near a place that sells fancy popcorn, and none of that bodes well. . . but ignore the warning signs and go in. . There are a few staples in an Italian restaurant, and one of them is the Chicken Parm. If you can't make a lights out Chicken Parm then you should close your doors. Manhattan makes a very good one. The chicken is tender, the batter is crispy, the mozzarella is good and the sauce is great. Their red sauce is excellent. Just the right amount of garlic and acidity. The pasta is always cooked well, never over cooked and mushy. The next is meatballs. Manhattan makes a very good meatball; it is almost all meat and no unnecessary fillers. Lastly, can it make a pizza. . . a great pizza. . . and Manhattan. . . excels! Rex is more the New York style pizza kind of man. If you like a doughy crust, you are a hick, and this place might not be for you. They do put a lot of toppings on it, and that is a good thing. . The truth about Manhattan is the same truth people say about Rex Marvin. . . almost everything is good. There isn't too much Rex hasn't tried he didn't like. The fried foods are all good, with a nod to the mozzarella sticks. The pastas are all good and have good sauces. The Alfredo could have some more parmesan cheese in it for Rex's taste, but you shake some more on and it is good.  . The prices are too high. Period. The food is good, but Rex finds himself not going because for the same amount of money there are better options. If they dropped the prices Rex would eat there a lot more. . There are a lot worse places to go than Manhattan especially for the pizza. They do a very good job at New York style pizza, not perfect but a very good job. They obviously care and try hard to make a quality product. Sometimes they succeed better than others, but it is never awful. Rex can appreciate that. Just like Three Legged Midget Maggie, sometimes it takes a few throws, but she always tries. She always gives an effort. . . and in the end of the day. . . that means something. Rex doesn't know what it means, but it means something. . Mahattan isn't Rex's first choice. It isn't even his second or third, but in a pinch it is good. It is really a 2 1/2 star place. Order right, catch it on the right night, it can be very good. Normally it is just above good. For the money, you can do better than good.","Stopped in for late lunch, and my son &amp; I agree, this was freshest tasting pizza we've had in a long while!  The girls working here are extremely nice, waited on us, refilled drinks, and cleaned up our table when we were done, and kept smiles on their faces the whole time. Place is kept very clean too. I'd definitely recommend!","Home style food was a nice change. Didn't have to wait for a table on a Sunday afternoon. I'm not sure if I enjoyed their appetizers as much as the entree. Everything was really oily. The pizza small is a good size for one.","I went to their pizza \"rodizio\" yesterday, which is happening every Thursday of this month. For those who still don't know what a rodizio is, I'm saving you a Google search: you pay an amount and waiters keep bringing you food until you say you're full or you explode, whatever happens first. . I was expecting to eat just pizza, but they had a small pasta and salad buffet that was included in the price of $20/person. The lasagna was awesome - of course I didn't try everything because I was there for the pizza, after all. . The pizza slices are smaller than normal so you can try many different kinds. The \"Portuguese\" (ham, cheese, egg, peas and onions) and the four cheese (mozzarella, parmesan, gorgonzola and catupiry) were the best ones, in my opinion. . Please, go ahead and make your reservation. You won't be sorry.","Note: CASH ONLY!. I have yet to conquer their titular menu item, but I can say with absolute confidence and honesty that The Original Gyro of Castle Shannon (formerly a pizza joint) has already vanquished every other Baklava and order of Stuffed Grape Leaves I've ever had the fortune of eating. . The grape leaves are pouches of gastronomic pleasure that nearly burst with rice and a most delicate ground lamb. The lavish, honey-kissed, nut-embedded Baklava will simultaneously exercise your jaw muscles and seduce your sweet tooth, suggesting flavors and preparation far beyond their $2 price tag. . P. S. Dig those late hours!","Having just moved to the area, Casey's has been such an amazing place to have available. They truly have a little bit of everything available 24 hours a day. Everybody who works here has always been so friendly and helpful. Their pizza is also really, really, really good. It's my favorite so far in the area. Who would've thought??? We have only done carry out up to this point, but they do now offer delivery. Delivery hours are 4:30 p. m. - 10 p. m. There is a delivery fee of $2 per order with a minimum purchase of $10 required. Forms of payment accepted include major credit cards, cash and check.","Their pizza is really really good. Nice clean space. A little pricey though. You get a pizza with three items and your over 40 bucks!","Travel to CLT a lot but this was the first time trying PZA. Missed dinner tue to delayed flights, and missed breakfast due to early flight out. Great breakfast pizza! Did the job.","More like 2. 5 stars. I'm giving two so the owners will have more incentive to make the necessary tweaks. . I really wanted to like Strada 241. It's a beautiful space and the service is friendly, but the food was lackluster. We split a salumi plate and each had a pizza (I had the 'nduja). The salumi plate was nice but a little on the small side and lacking in variety, with only three meats. The pizzas looked good but were pretty tasteless - the cheese was bland, the sauce was bland and missing the necessary balance of tanginess and sweetness, and the crust was dried out and lacking flavor (probably a result of the electric oven). . I would come back to try the pastas and also to see if the pizza improves. There's no lack of effort here and the food is honest.","Love this place for fresh Cookies and breads. Best (and only) bakery in town. Small scale so things do run out. I've heard the pizzas are also fab.","I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant/brew pub. The beer selection is pretty good here if you want to try different beers, and their food is pretty good. I came here for brunch which was average, but I really enjoyed the pizza I ordered on a different occasion. I would recommend this place as a nice spot to go for dinner.","Used to be a good place. Has gone downhill the last few years. I already know their pizza is not good anymore, it was when they first opened, but I was in the mood for pasta and decided to give them a chance to redeem themselves . . I ordered to go and when I got their at 8 pm on a Saturday night and there was only one two person table and no other people in the restaurant, I had a feeling something wasn't right. . Spent $23. 17 on two pastas to go. One the was spaghetti with meat sauce, I would compare it to a can of Chef Boyardee. The other was a pesto pasta with chicken, not very good either. . Threw them both in the trash. After this meal, I also threw my Streets of New York takeout menu in the trash","This place really does it right. They have a small but focused menu, and the food is pretty basic: burgers, wings, pizza, and a few sides. But you can tell that they do everything from scratch and the quality is outstanding. I dare say the burger is better than Fatheads right down the street (also a great burger). Highly recommended!","The food wasn't bad. We had pizza, ribs, and fried chicken. We are in town for an event and found them on Restaurant. com. Our server Melissa was awesome. Very friendly and attentive. I hope to come back.","Very good food &amp; service on our visit. It's a little pricey, but for quality Chicago deep dish pizza, I don't mind blowing some coin!  I would recommend giving this place a try!","One thing is for sure. . . having a hospitality card is such a perk. 50% off everyting! including food. . If you show your \"grinder\" app on mondays you get a 50% band. We tried to show the bartender, but I think you have to show it upon entrance. . Lobster Dip - My favorite by far. The crackers are really good.  it has sesame seeds on one side of the long rectangle cracker. Can you say addicting!. I've had a bunch of their pizza and theiy're all not bad.  . I haven't been at martinis for over a year now and I was surprised that they didn't search much  in the extra shaker anymore. = 0( I was a little bummbed. The bartenders were very nice and accommodating! PLUS!","Custom built pizza with high quality, fresh ingredients, a decent price, what else could you ask for? Oh, and it tastes really really really good!","Great pizza. My friends and I go here a lot. Good pizza, good wings, good restaurant.","The food and vibe here is outstanding. It's definitely a place where I'll be taking all our friends when they come into Madison. . For starters, the fried chicken is some of the best I've ever had. If you like buffalo sauce, it's a home run. . Meatballs - pretty tasty themselves, but the red sauce is magical. . Entrees:. The pizza sauce is perfect. While I love a good wood fired pizza, the steel pan pizza is Madison's pizza. I mean spotted cow in the dough? It's a thicker pizza with a cheese baked onto the outside of the dough. . The black mushroom truffle wood fired and Calabrian sausage pizza were the two our table tried. . Dessert:. The only dessert currently in the place is the pizza cookie, but it's all it needs. A partially baked cookie covered with vanilla ice cream. Drool. . . The entire table can share it and it's a whopping $5. Get 1 per 4 people and you're set. . There's a lounge downstairs, amazing beer selection, and much more I could talk about. Check it out. You won't be upset.","This is a fun place with a trendy atmosphere. It's one of the few places in town that allow you to mix and match beer flights at a fair price. The food is fun and tasty. I recommend the mussels, pizzas, and wings.","There is an unfortunate amount of hate-on going for ol' Sam's, so I've decided to come to their (honest) rescue. First, let me give you some context:. 1. This is not the place to come for authentic Chinese cuisine. Abort mission if that's your goal. Go somewhere with a name that you can barely understand. . 2. This is not the place to come for personalized service and attention, especially not at 2am on a weekend. You will be treated like what you probably are - a starving drunk person just as likely to skip out on your bill as you are to vomit on their floor. . Seriously - these folks put up with a lot. A LOT. Can you imagine taking care of hundreds of drunken morons every single night for the entire weekend? It'd be like babysitting 100 children with ADHD who are also carrying loaded pistols and have an undeniable urge to hump on your white tablecloths. So I chose to cut them some slack. . 3. I liken this to being the Denny's of Chinese food. It is greasy, unhealthy and oh-so-delicious. You love it while your eating it. You tell yourself it's the greatest meal you've ever had in your life and you want to marry it. . But in 15 minutes it's going to sit like a stone in your stomach and you will question every ounce of your judgment. If you can survive this brief period of remorse, your overall experience will come out on the positive. . 4. On a diet? Yeah, no. Not for you. . Yes, I too have been part of the raucous crowd that convenes here late at night after a night out in the Beltline. I have slithered their noodles down my throat and I have savored the juices of their finest ginger beef. I literally can't imagine coming here for a sit down meal at any other time. . I've also come here for the lunch buffet - as take out. The place isn't quite as fun when the disco ball isn't a-glowin'. Now if you're a student, a cheapskate or a person in need of large quantities of food (as much as you can physically force into a styrofoam container) - this place is a great option come lunchtime. Just make sure you bring CASH. They get a bit ornery if you try to pay with Debit/Credit. . Pro tip: Stuff as much as you can into your styrofoam container and just hold it shut, even if it won't close naturally. You might get dirty looks, but I've never been yelled at - yet. Mmmmm, 5 pounds of Calgary's finest imitation Asian cuisine. . Is 4 stars probably pushing it? Yes. If I could I'd give them a 3. 5. But as someone else mentioned, Calgary owes these fine folks a bit of thanks for giving us an option other than late night pizza or microwaved Alphaghetti.","I am not a person for Buffets unless I am in Vegas but I was totally blown away f=by this place!!! First of all just the deco of the place was one big investment as the had it all in there including the Eiffel Tower, Greek wind mill, part of china and italy. . Then there was the food and since I am careful what I am eating they actually had lots to offer. plenty of veggies, 7 different types of pizza. A complete turkey which I had but they had roasts of all types. Which I was told are slow cooked over night. . Chinese food was good esp. the spring rolls which I have a friend who makes and these were exactly like his. . The owner gave me a complete tour of the place which seats 800+ yes 800. He told me saturday nite he is full. They even had private rooms for conference or weddings etc. . . Out door on the roof for the summer. Mind blowing. Everything is cook in house. . I will be back.","If you come on a Friday or Saturday after 6 or 7pm, expect to have a bit of a wait. One nice perk is that they have an open table that you can stand at to enjoy your pre-dinner drinks so you don't have to crowd around those sitting at the bar. I absolutely love the atmosphere at this place with the big wood-burning pizza oven behind the bar where you can watch your pizza being cooked. They have a great selection of wines from different countries and their food options are not overwhelming, but always deliver big. When I went a couple months ago, they had caramelized brussel sprouts that they cooked in the wood-burning oven that were amazing!! I've tried many of their pizzas and haven't had one that I dislike. My favorites are the Quattro Formaggio and the Spicy Sopressata, which despite the name, is not too spicy. In the summer, a huge perk to this place is their outdoor patio. They have a couple long picnic tables and also have smaller tables along the fence. On a warm spring/summer night, it's very relaxing to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather.","One of THE worst pizzas I've ever had. The cooks are really cheap when it comes to cheese (the pizza was almost all tomato sauce) because the cheese was missing. Absolutely no taste. I don't usually bad reviews unless earned and these ppl working here certainly earned a bad review. Maybe the owner is a cheap person and is forcing cooks to be cheap with toppings.","I've totally given up on this place.  . The staggeringly bad choices for Asian food around Moon / Sewickley are just all around.  . Since I live nearby, I hit this place as a default setting. Kung Pao Chicken ($11) and Shrimp Toast ($7. 95). It adds up in a hurry and by the end of the meal, you wonder, \"Where did it all go?\"  Or if you are feeling a little on the existential side, \"Is that all there is?\". For the price, the Kung Pao Chicken tastes cheap and rubbery. On the good side, you get plenty of this cheap and rubbery chicken. Flavor is just meh. A bit on the bland side sometimes. . The Shrimp Toast is OK.  Most times I have ordered this, it comes burnt. . Since it's mostly pizza places that deliver to our house, Hunan is the only non-pizza option that delivers. If I order Kung Pao and Shrimp Toast, I easily get to the $15 minimum delivery threshold. But, in the end, I should have just driven myself to Leetsdale or Robinson for something better. . On the upside, if you do end up eating inside the restaurant, very nice people work there. But, the food coming out of that kitchen is just bland, bland, bland.","Dinner at Lago was fantastic, from the setting to the service to the food and drinks. We sat outside on a beautiful fall evening, with the sights and sounds of Cleveland's Flats gradually coming back to life. It's a great menu, with lots to choose from. We had the calamari (sauteed, not fried, in a delicious tomato sauce that was perfect for dipping lots of bread in) and the homemade pasta with meatballs. It's the best of comfort food, with enough imagination and elegance to make it special. I had a delicious easy glass of pinot noir and my boyfriend had a gin martini -- we agreed it was exactly how we like our martinis: extremely cold, with just the right balance, and awesome cheese stuffed olives. Our only disappointment was the mushroom pizza--the crust is nothing special and the toppings were just ok. We were so happy (and full) at that point, the so-so pizza didn't faze us at all. We'll just stick to ordering pizza at Humble in Lakewood, and come back to Lago for the pasta. A great evening all around!","The best thing about this restaurant is their pizza. Even though it's \"raw\" it's still really tasty and filling. The BLT is pretty good too, but messy to eat--definitely not a good first date food. . I think you have to keep an open mind when you go to places like this, because the rawness makes it harder to fool your average carnivore. I've seen children at nearby tables take one bite, make a face and push the plate away, whereas in places where they cook the vegan food kids will have no idea that they're not eating chicken fingers or whatever the item is. . The service here is slow. And when I say slow I mean I aged considerably while waiting for my food. I wish I could say this only happened once, but it's happened every time I've been there. I think it's because they make everything from scratch and there are only one or two people working in the restaurant at all times. If you have three or four tables, you do the math. It isn't pretty. . I'm happy to have this place open as an option, but it does not get my highest recommendation.","Nice pizza /snack place, pleasant ambiance and not too formal. Fast friendly service. Their pizza Zucca is amazing! 4 stars for overall value","One of the best NY style pizzas in the city. Location is not much to look at on the outside, but very clean and fresh on the inside. Plenty of parking.","This probably one of the best pizza I ever eaten. We order a large pepperoni and salami . It was so good. When im in town  again I will be coming here","I recently went to this restaurant with a group of friends as I had heard so many positive reviews and must say Artigiani definately lived up to expectations. This resto serves up one  of the best wood oven pizza's in montreal. Their  pizza is thin crust  and  they a have wide variety of pizza's that will please your pallette. Ambiance is cozy and modern decor. They also serve up a great seafood pasta dish for all you seafood lovers and must not forget to mention their fried calamari entree. Lastly, be sure to leave room for their wonderful tiramisu dessert served in a gelato glass. Would definately recommend!","I came here based on the great reviews on Yelp. I have never had Georgian food before. I was mostly interested in trying the hachapuri (georgian pizza shaped like a boat with an egg on top). It is the coolest thing I have ever seen on yelp. . So we got here on an afternoon to have some lunch. The restaurant just opened but there was already a party inside! The servers are really nice and really cute :o. Lol. Anyway, we wanted to get a hachapuri and some khinkali (georgian dumplings). There were no pictures on the menu, but even the photos on yelp were hard to distinguish the sizing and portion of food. Let me say upon arrival of our food I was shocked by how generous the portions were! The Khinkali dumplings each of them were like the size of a small person's fist. And the hachapuri was the size of a small pizza. Very filling indeed, even when sharing with a friend. We both loved the food. The khinkali pork and beef had some interesting spices. . . tasted very beefy and rich. I needed to cleanse the palate with some of their tangy dipping sauces from time to time. Their sauces are really tasty btw. They come as a complimentary appetizer with some hot buns on the side. . The food was so memorable! I would love to come back to try some other Georgian dishes. I think though, the place could use some natural lighting, it is very dim inside.","Solid pizza. Maybe slightly on the rich side but sometimes that's what you're looking for! Went for this when Pizzaiolo was closed last night and was very happy with the decision.","Great service, decent food. I went here with my family for dinner and the staff was extremely friendly and nice. The pizza was ok, we ordered two large pizzas, one was all cheese and the other was half veggie and half buffalo chicken. My husband said he enjoyed the buffalo chicken the most, I preferred the cheese. I didn't get to try the veggie but my mom said it was very good. The bruschetta was very tasty and I would recommend trying it. We also really enjoyed their pizookie, and if you like warm cookies and ice-cream I would highly recommend trying it!","(2. 5/3) For first timers, this 'restaurant' is organized a lot like a high-tech, italian-only food court. Walk in and an employee will hand you a handy, dandy card which you use to swipe and accumulate expenses at various food stations (pasta, salad, antipasto, pizza, bar, dessert). It's convenient and not too crowded. Apparently the pasta is made fresh daily and they actually cook the dish in front of you--note, this significantly increases your wait time. . I ordered the Pasta Vongole (one of the specials listed in front of the pasta station - $9. 95). It was supposed to have white wine, clams, garlic, capers, and anchovies. However, upon closer inspection, my capers and anchovies must have vanished in thin air. The pasta is good, but the dish as a whole lacked flavor. LIke past reviewers, I also found my pasta dry (however, one of my friends had pasta that looked like it was sauced in soup). Serving sizes are huge though (considering how filling pasta can be). My friend who got the carbonara said the sauce was much too heavy but he really enjoyed his side caesar salad. \"The anchovy flavor was great. \" I also got the trio of bruschetta ($4. 50) and white chocolate mousse ($2. 75) to go. . Finally, I had some issues with the card they provided in that it charged me almost $10 more than it should have when I went to check out. Fortunately, the cashiers were understanding and removed the mysteriously appearing dishes from my check. Overall, I would give this place a second chance since the fresh-made pasta actually has a great texture and the employees are friendly. It's also a great alternative to fast food and traditional sit-down restaurants.","My review is based on my experience with the management, not the food. The food is just ok, nothing to write home about. Secret pizza at Cosmo is better. . The manager on duty failed to do his duties when I requested him to call security to come assist me when I was being harassed by a drunk belligerent man while in line. I felt unsafe and wanted security to come but the manager NEVER CALLED them. He in fact lied to me saying that they were too busy to assist me. I spoke to security later on that night and they told me they never received a call. . SHAME ON YOU manager on duty Sunday 1:30AM for lying about calling security.","3. 5 . This is a beautiful restaurant in the heart of Yorkville. For a Tuesday night, it was pretty busy but certainly not full. The food was not bad, not the best I've ever had but definitely above average and the service was pretty good!. I had a glass of the Pinot Grigio which I enjoyed. I notice the list of white wines was a bit smaller. There were a lot more red wine choices and most of the choices were for entire bottles. The prices were a bit on the higher side but it's a beautiful restaurant in Yorkville so that's to be expected. . I had the spinach salad which was good but I found there were too many sweet elements. The salad dressing was a strawberry vinaigrette and there were figs and dried cranberries and some sort of crispy onions and bocconcini cheese. I would have enjoyed a goats cheese or something to cut the sweetness of it. The elements were fresh tasting however. We also ordered the burrata appetizer that came with a sizable ball of burrata cheese and prosciutto on a bed of arugula. The burrata was delicious and the portion was good for the price. . I had the gnocchi as my main, which while was filling, was a small portion on a huge plate. I saw some other dishes like the lasagna and pizzas and panzerotti and they were a lot larger. Maybe I'd go with one of those options next time. The pasta was also somewhat mediocre in my opinion, the sauce wasn't the best and the ricotta on top didn't really add much to it. . Since we were there for a birthday, we also got a Nutella pizza to share. I love Nutella so that was good but I found the crust to be really chewy in some parts and burnt in other parts. There were also a total of 5 banana slices on the pizza and a few hazelnuts sprinkles on top. It was a nice after dinner treat but it wasn't amazing. . The service was pretty good. The food came a bit slow but it's not a fast food restaurant so you can't expect that. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. Modern and warm and stylish. The kitchen is open so you can see the pizzas being made which is really cool. . Overall this is a nice spot for dinner. The prices are on the higher side but not outrageously so, especially for the area. It's definitely a cool, stylish place with pretty good food. The ambience is really what I'd come back for, and maybe the lasagna!","Ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats-Unis, j'\u00e9vitais son ouverture \u00e0 Laval comme la peste.

Spinach dip is also really good! Good place to go!! Yum!!","24 hour service!  702-333-8000Exceptional chicken fettuccine Alfredo! White pizza is to die for!!! Everything is homemade I love it. 24hr delivery and pick up. The owner is super friendly!!! 5 stars!!!!!","First time here with two little boys my 5 yo boy and his 9yo friend. We just came from Flipnout extreme and this was the closest dine in pizza place we could find. Very happy we came here. The I think manager or owner was very polite and friendly with us making us feel welcome. The pizza we ordered, a small half cheese and pepperoni and garlic bread, was very good!  Overall, we would come again. :)","Fantastic meal, pizza made just like we wanted it. They added pepperoni to half of our Bacon &amp; Blue with barely a raised eye. Great atmosphere and the service (Alex) was by far the best we had during our entire stay. Friendly staff, and just a stellar meal.","Honestly? It tasted weird. I was visiting extended family and we bought two pizzas--1/2 veggie/meat and one cheese. The sauce was too sweet and the veggies were not at all what I expected. Now, Mineo's. . . better pizza.","First time here. Checked in and got the pepperoni cheese stick for FREE.  It was great. . The service was very welcoming as they checked to make sure if everything was ok. . The dining area was roomy and my son had room to stretch his legs and did not felt pressure to just sit there-felt very welcoming. . Ordered chicken wings with garlic ranch. Omg so glad we did,  it was amazing. The chicken was crispy with a nice crunch with every bite and did I mentioned the garlic. It was so delicious!. The XL pizza was huge with a crispy crust and a soft bottom texture that was not overly oily with every bite. The topping were really tasty with half of it topped with pepperoni,  black olives, and sausages. The other half had pepperoni,  onions,  and bacon. To spice it up we asked for jalapeno on the side. . Will definitely return.","This was my second time in the last few months meeting a friend for lunch at. Luciano Garden Restaurant. It is not far from my home. The restaurant was perfect for conversation, and very comfortable. The pizza is the best pizza I have had in a long time in the Las Vegas area. The chopped salad was a generous portion with a lovely light dressing. I plan to have dinner with my husband in the near future and am looking forward to trying some of their seafood, pasta dishes.","Best happy hour!!! Very rare to find a sushi happy hour especially one so good! Had to try the intriguing blackened tuna pizza which was actually very delicious. Crunch roll and harmony roll tasted fresh and had great texture! Our hostess greeted us warmly and we were sat promptly, forget our server's name but she took great care of us and always checked back. Glad I live close, boyfriend and I are most definitely coming back","The pizza is pretty good. The wings were very good. Service was good. I think it is a little over priced. Didnt like that pop comes in a plastice bottle $2. 99 each.","My favorite Giordanos in AZ! The service and food is perfection. What I appreciate about it is that it's the closest tasting pizza compared to my hometown of Chicago. We love deep dish and the crust doesn't disappoint. The sauce is well seasoned which is also something I pay attention to. This is our family spot.","Almost walked out as soon as we walked in, looked kind of sketchy. Very happy we decided to order though. The pizza was unbelievable, I think this might have been one of the best crusts I have ever had. Thoroughly enjoyed every bite!!  Though it may not look like much from the outside, pizza here is a must try.","With a patio sheltered from the noise of 17th Avenue (and growing the herbs used in most of the dinner items) a very large dining space and a menu full of excellent scodellina options, Cibo is a great place for chatty drinks with the girls, chatty pasta with your family or pizza sharing with your date. . Far from classic, Cibo takes Italian and turns it Calgarian with modern menu items, super-fresh, super local ingredients in dishes you can't help but share and hipster-turned-friendly servers willing to laugh with the guests. . Cibo is bustling with the hippest of pizza connoisseurs laughing over fig and gorgonzola pie, the trendiest of the Uptown 17th sharing smoked black cod anitpesto and the coolest of Calgary shouting \"you gotta try this!\" passing house-made olives to the next table; all this activity set firmly on the backbone of simply great food. . Cibo is fun, it's fun to hang out at for a drink, it's fun to talk to people there and it's a fun place to eat. . T.","California Pizza Kitchen has always been one of those places that everyone can agree on. The menu is big enough where there is something for everyone and usually everyone walks away happy. Lately though, the quality of the food as gone way down. . Before I went vegetarian I used to always get the chicken waldorf salad and it was always so good. I love the blue cheese and the candied walnuts. They were addicting. Since I've become vegetarian I settled on the hummus appetizer, grilled vegetable salad, and the wild mushroom pizza. Recently though, they have completed revamped the menu, adding new items, taking old favorites off. For some places, menu changes mean new and exciting food opportunities and makes the visit to that place even better. Not for CPK. . Recently, since beginning to use yelp, I have wanted to try new places and veer away from old favorites or places that I am used to. However, I tend to have friends and family members who are food-borists. . . Ya I just invented a new word. A food-borist is someone who never wants to try anything new, and will eat at the same place and order the same exact thing all of the time. My friends are this way. It never fails. Any time one of them has a birthday I get an invitation to eat at CPK and every time I groan. Even before I swore off CPK forever, I was getting extremely tired of it. The second to the last time I went was for my birthday with some friends. I ordered the new roasted vegetable salad and a cup of the vegetarian tortilla soup. I used to love the grilled vegetable salad and was pissed when they replaced it on the menu with roasted vegetable salad. Not good. I struggled through it because my friends paid for my dinner and I didn't want to waste their money. But it was gross, and I vowed never to order it again. The soup was good though. The last time I went was with my sister, husband and niece. This time I ordered the new caramelized peach salad. On the menu, most of the new items sound really good. Its just the execution of them that fails CPK. The peach salad was gross. The peaches were canned and then warmed, and I also saw no caramelization whatsoever. The combination of the peaches with the gorgonzola (my favorite cheese of all time) was so unappetizing. I didn't even get through half of the salad before I said forget it. My husband ordered the garlic cream fettuccine and added sauteed mushrooms and was upset by this as well. The portion size was really small and it was extremely salty. My sister ordered the barbecue cobb salad which was almost entirely jicama. She barely ate half as well because it was just a giant jicama salad! They skimped on all of the other items in the salad and just pretty much covered some jicama in barbecue dressing. . The pricing at CPK has also become outrageous. It was almost $13 for my salad. For a salad! Does anyone else find that wrong? Considering the ingredients, my salad should have cost $7, tops! Pasta is expensive, pizzas were generally reasonable for awhile but those prices have been raised as well. For such a casual dining place the prices are just exorbitant. The service also sucks. Our waitress probably spent two minutes total the entire meal at our table. No refilled waters, no how is everything. She was just rushing around everyone else's table except ours. . So we all have made a vow never to return to any CPK. Especially the one in the Chandler Fashion Center. Before I went vegetarian, I got a lovely surprise one morning after eating here and was graced with food poisoning for two days. That was a great experience.","I called and spoke to the owner, he was very genuine and concerned and sent me a pizza on the house the following night and it arrived exactly at 7:30 with apologies from the driver. . Their pizza is so good that I am totally thrilled that they've fixed the delivery glitch so quickly. . Kudos to you.","Despite other glowing reviews posted about this location, I cannot in good conscience give a good review. . Vapiano is a European concept Italian restaurant with a hybrid operation - somewhere between a sit-down restaurant (but no wait staff), a cafeteria/buffet (lines at various food stations), and a fast foot place (counter service). Vapiano straddles these distinctions with technology. Each customer gets a \"credit card\" to track their purchases then pays upon leaving. Maybe that works better for pizzas and large shared plates, but it is a bit awkward for couples and small groups. And if you want something else (another drink, dessert, etc. ), you have to go re-order at the appropriate counter. Sort of awkward in my opinion. . Vapiano's concept strongly emphasizes interior design - it even says so on their web page. And while that is all well and good, two true tests of a restaurant are the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the environment. Vapiano scores moderately well on the food (slightly better than average Italian), but falters significantly on cleanliness. . After my food was prepared, I took the tray to a nearby table. I placed the tray down and noticed there were very small winged insects crawling on the table. Not sure what they were - really small termites or large aphids? Bugs and food - not a good combination!  So I changed table two more times and still there were bugs on the tables. Maybe they were there because of the plants in the restaurant? I don't know, but since I already had my food, I chose the \"least buggy\" table and finished my meal as quickly as I could. Guess it could be at least as buggy as sitting outside or having a picnic? The moderate mid-week crowd that was there seemed to not notice this problem. . The last table I selected was along the left-side of the restaurant, where there are long white drapes made of a sort of gauzy material. The drapes hang down to almost table surface height and the tables are perpendicular to the windows. Well, you can guess what comes next - looking at the drapes, you can easily see that they were absolutely filthy, stained by who-knows-how-many previous meals. While pasta and marinara sauce can be a bit messy, whoever thought to put white drapes next to a table surface wasn't much of a designer. A simple solution would have been to rotate the tables 90-degrees so they were parallel with the drapes - harder to stain that way. Another good solution - replace the drapes with clean ones, or remove them altogether!. As I left to pay, the hostess asked me how my meal was. I mentioned the bugs and stains, but she seemed oblivious to this. Had she heard it before? Did she not care? I paid and left. . Insects and a dirty environment are a deadly combination for future success. This location needs to get its act together - get rid of the tiny little buggers and clean the drapes. . I give this Vapiano location 3 stars (average) for food, but ZERO stars for cleanliness.","Love the area, parking was a short walk (and free). Cute little shop with seating off to the left. The employees were not friendly nor rude. They were just. . . there. However, the lady who brought out our to-go bag was really nice. Most of the ice cream flavors were \"OUT\" (written in chalk on their massive menu board). This was 2 hours before closing so that might have had something to do with it. Still, there were some flavors that I would have loved to try but was unable to and that was disappointing. . They have metal spoons for the ice cream samples - that was unique and something I've never seen before. . Sampled the Turkish Coffee and French Toast ice cream, both were yummy but the french toast won (hands down!!!). . I just realized that I wasn't offered the little \"sample\" scoop on top of my french toast ice cream. I'll be sure to ask for it when I go next time. Seems kind of odd that I have to ask though. If that's their \"thing\", they should offer it to every customer, each time ice cream is ordered. Oh well. . My husband and I also bought fries. He ordered the cheddar bacon fries - pretty tasty with lots of cheese and bacon bits and 1 side of ranch. . I ordered the chicken tenders and fries which came with 1 side of honey mustard (which tasted more like mustard with a hint of honey). A boring and safe choice and it tasted, well. . . boring and safe. . The fries are rather expensive for what they are though. The pictures of the pizza fries look good but the price, along with it being extra $$$ for pepperoni (wth?), I will surely pass. . I will most likely make my way back for the ice cream, but not for the fries unless I'm starving and nothing else around seems appetizing. The fries are pretty good (well, my husband's were) but they are just too expensive and they aren't anything wondrous. . Spending $22 for doctored fries, small (albeit delicious) ice cream and meh service is a bit unappealing to me.","Sauce has grown on me. . . particularly this location since this is the one I frequently end up at for a quick lunch or casual dinner spot near home. . I typically order chopped salads at lunch. The chopped turkey &amp; feta salad is what I had today. I had them add asparagus, which was a great call if I may say so myself!  The large salad and fresh roll is the perfect lunch. . . fresh, filling, healthy enough, and pretty inexpensive when it comes to designer salads around town. I also like the spinach, pancetta &amp; goat cheese and the veggie &amp; aged parmesan salads.  . My husband eats at Sauce often as well. . . he goes for a salad or sandwich. Last time we were there together, he had the salami, turkey, prosciutto &amp; mozzarella panini. I had a bite and was pleasantly surprised! It had a nice balance of thin sliced meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and tangy red wine vinegar in between two perfectly grilled pieces of bread. The thin crust pizzas are pretty decent also. Depending on your appetite, sharing a pizza and a salad with your companion can work out to be a satisfactory meal. . . . What I like about Sauce the most? Fast, friendly, and efficient service in a clean and casual environment. The moderate pricing is also a big plus in my book. . . especially in this economy.","I thought everything was fantastic. The food was incredible, the drinks were strong and remarkably tasty, and the feeling at the restaurant was just very upbeat and lively. To begin we had wine and a bourbon based pre made cocktail. I really liked the ingenuity of the cocktail where you're given a bottle instead of having to wait for the crafting each time. We then had the tuna cones, mushroom flatbread, and the brussel sprout salad. The ahi cones had a nice kick with the sauce and the presentation was awesome. The flatbread had more of a pizza feel than your typical flatbread which I enjoyed tremendously. The brussel spirit salad was a nice side with whole pieces of bacon and apple rather than sprinkled as per usual. I like this heartier rendition better. The ambiance of the bar is really nice and the staff were great. I really wish I had a casual bar like this closer to my house on the west side. Prices are very high so it's not a weekly dining venue, but I highly recommend trying it out if you're looking for a new cocktail bar with amazing food on the strip.","They have good service, beer selection, and the pizza we got was fantastic. Their spinach dip was more of typical bar food, just alright.","Great Service. The food was good. The lasagna was a little too spicy for me. I want to try their pizza next. Parking was crazy and long wait times are negative factors.","first off i called and the guy barley spoke any english then i had ordered a pizza and had decided to cancel so 2 minutes later i called and canceled but they still charged my credit card so i called and ask for a refund and they pretty much told me too bad so beware of this and i would suggest romas pizza very good and family owned","Nice little spot, cozy for 2 but I gotta say I was a bit upset that they had no bitters for my fav Old fashioned, I like to try these everywhere I go but was a bit upset with no bitters. My Wife wanted a wine but guess what. . . . . . they didn't have it even thou it was on the menu. . The food on the other hand was real good. I ordered a Paris pizza which I never really order but thoroughly enjoyed. It even had brie which I do not like but really went well. Wife had the lasagna which again was very good. . Definitely go back again. Would have given a better rating but no bitters and no wine of our choice bummed us out.","Second time in and again I wait for a Ready Now plain ole cheese pizza!   I need to learn to go to another store that may be ready to care for customers!","Ordered delivery for me and the kids. Two hours later, our meal arrived. I called to inquire after about an hour. Was told that the delivery was on the way. Minutes later received a call that it was being fired and would be delivered soon. Do you think it was on the house? Nope. Just got a piece of cheesecake and  20% coupon. Not good enough. . Now, let's talk food. The meatball \"panini\" was a piece of French bread with a bland/acidic sauce. The meatballs were overcooked and dry. Not a pleasant experience. The pizza sauce was also watery and bland. You'd think that a place called \"Sauce\" would have figured it out by now. Not so.","I stopped in here for a slide and a soda one day and was very pleased. This is real deal great pizza, plus a great atmosphere and fair price. I have also since learned that this pizza is the go-to for many local businesses, who all swear by it for their lunch purposes.","With all the talk of Rocky's, Toppers and Ian's, this place has in my opinion the best pizza. . . I've not tried their regular pizza, but their Chicago stuffed style is the best I've had in Madison. . And their sandwiches are very good as well. They have a fantastic selection for a pizza delivery place, and they deliver quickly.","Just your typical warehouse club right? I guess that depends on your definition of typical. Sam's club has hours just for buisness members starting at 7:00am. You can also fax in or go online and have them shop for you. All you do is go in a pay for it. . They have a few membership levels- Business, Gold Member and Premium. The Premium level you earn 2% back on all your purchases. They do give you two cards for the price that you pay, so you can go in with a neighbor and each get a card. . In addition to electronics, photo lab, optical center, bakery, meat department, they also have a little know \"clearance\" section at each Sam's. You just have to know where it is. Also when they are clearancing out merchandise, the price will end in a \"1\". Most common is . 71 or . 81. I have picked up 5 pound bags of mixed candy for . 71 a bag, and lots of other deals just by knowing this little secret. . They do discount their meat the day before they need to pull it from the shelves. They also will give cookies to children. . My boys also love the cafe where they get their \"pizza and drink please. \"  Their menu has changed  a lot lately though and I am not sure if I like it. Prices are very reasonable though. . They also have gasoline pumps outside which if you know your prices can be a good thing!. If you are not satified with your membership, you can cancel at anytime and they will prorate your membership refund. Their refund policy is really good as well.","Delicious huge slices for reasonable prices. They bring the pizza to your table and they also have wifi.","The pepperoni pizza I had was well done and my husband had a cheese pizza he very much enjoyed. I disappointed not to see some yummy chicken tenders. Preferably in a hot style. Besides pizza there was nothing really else on the menu that I desired to try. Definitely come back for the pizza specially for the price it's a good deal.","We were supposed to go to another restaurant in the boulevard, but one of my friends didn't like Alice Fazooli's for some reason, so we ended up coming here on a Saturday night. The wait time for patio was only a few minutes. Although it was crowded, the noise level was very low. People were enjoying their beers and engaging in conversations that you could easily hear. The service was good as usual. I got the mushroom and chicken pizza, which is served on the same kind of bread as their Souvlaki. In fact, the chicken Souvlaki and my pizza tasted exactly the same when I added the Tzatziki sauce. The pizza was very so-so, and the toppings were so loose on the bread that I had to eat it like a sandwich. In comparison to the North York branch, the patio is the only bonus. . What I like about Moxie's is that they cater to every taste. There's a food option for those who like Greek, Indian, American and Italian. If you have a crowd that's hard to please, bring them to Moxie's. Nobody has the right to complain here about the lack of food options!","Buca is a lovely intimate space to celebrate any special event. The space is a great blend between industrial, rustic and upscale aesthetics. We had great service and our waitress was very helpful with recommendations. . We came over the holidays to celebrate a birthday and had a great adventurous meal. You can definitely come across items that can't be found anywhere else! We started the night with Salumi De Buca and we got the lardo, spalla and the salsiccine. It was my first time trying lardo in this way, and it's texture was like caramel but tasted like cream. Very interesting! Next was the Trota, steelhead trout with a yogurt and herbs on top. The raw trout was fatty and meatier-tasting than tuna sashimi (as a benchmark) but the preparation kept it light and balanced. The most adventurous dish of the night was the Cervello. It's basically lamb's brain wrapped in a crispy salty bacon wrap. It sounds crazy but the brain is very light and has the texture of cream-cheese. It was a fun dish. . Of course, if you want to be less adventurous there are plenty of pastas, pizzas and entrees to choose from. The table next to us had some younger kids and the kitchen was able to accommodate making simple pastas for them.","If I could give this 0 stars I would. . Delivery took an hour. Pizza arrived cold and not prepared as ordered. Sausage is completely unseasoned pork topping. Gross is the only word I can think of to describe this pizza. Save your money. You'll get better pizza from the frozen food aisle at Giant Eagle.","My order got here earlier than expected but the toppings, cheese and sauce is all over the box. Now the crust is soggy. I hate being that person but now I have to call for a new pizza.","The service is slow and not very friendly and the pizza tastes store bought. I've tried to eat here several times with friends. . But it just doesn't seem to do anything for me. . There's a Jack in the Box across the parking lot with hot food and friendly service.","Went for my birthday dinner. So yummy! The decor is absolutely amazing. I fell in love, so classy, so chic, perfect for my bday celebration. I wanted pizza and what a good choice it was! We started with the chicken artichoke bruschetta! Excellent. Then had the four cheese pizza adding spinach. Delicious. Then they brought me a yummy dessert  I loved it!","This place SUCKS! The guy was very nice on the phone taking my order, but then 30 MIN later, I receive some call from Gary saying that they do not deliver to me. Thanks for letting me know when I placed my order and gave you my cc# already!!. I don't know how the pizza is yet, from other location, because it has yet to arrive. . Waste of time","I ordered from here and I was a little skeptical. But the food came fast it was fresh and delicious plus the driver was very pleasant. The prices are very fair 2 pizzas for 20 bucks with delivery and 24 hour service. Cant beat it. I will definitely order from here time and time again.","Horrible Food don't waste your money. This is the worse cardboard covered cheese &amp; sauce so called pizza I've ever had, I haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, Most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. IDK where that place is cuz the one I wan in today in East Liberty by the Home Depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad &amp; the people aren't nice &amp; friendly. . Loudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. Not one person there had decent customer service skills I had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and I have excellent hearing. I ordered a small pizza I got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. . I looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today.","We were out of town on a business trip and looking for somewhere local but not too pricy to eat. We found a flyer for this place in the door of our hotel room so we decided to give it a shot. The inside of the place is a total dump but don't let that fool you! We ordered three pizzas, two pepperoni and one meat lovers. Also I had the turkey sandwich. The pizza was fantastic!!! The crust is thin crust but it's yummy! The cheese and pepperoni are really yummy too! Good quality cheese. The meat lovers was amazing too! The turkey sandwich was pretty good the only thing I didn't like was that I didn't know it came with onions (the menu only says it comes with cheese) and I don't really like onions but what ever because after I bit into one I just took them off. Overall would highly recommend this place if you're in Vegas and looking for a good pizza place or a mom and pop restaurant to support. . P. s. The prices are fair too it was $20 for a medium pepperoni and a turkey sandwich","Where Humble may have fallen short for other Yelpers in the past, it surpassed expectations for my family and I this past Saturday. . Let me start by saying we came in during the dinner rush on a Saturday and were able to immediately sit at the bar area. While the patio and dinning room were packed, the bar seats in front of the wood/stone oven were open! Who wouldn't want to watch them artfully craft delicious food? I could have sat there alone and been completely entertained. Instead, the staff dazzled my family and I as we relaxed and perused the menu. . As far as service goes, I left over a 20% tip if that gives you any indication of how our meal went. I prefer bar service. I don't like the over-attention of being seated in dinning rooms and served. At the bar I always feel like I'm getting a more genuine experience without being suffocated. The gent at Humble Wine Bar did a great job of exactly that--great, quick service without being bothered. He took our orders, offered some feedback and even had a witty comeback for dad, who often loves teasing our servers at restaurants. My mom spilled her beer on her entire pizza and despite insisting she didn't want another pie, he put in an order and didn't charge us. Like I said, great service. . My dad loves wine and pizza, which is a big reason why we came here--but mostly the wine. He enjoyed the two glasses of red he had and compared them to the varieties he had tried on his recent trip to France. I also enjoyed the rose cava and the red I tried. But really, any restaurant or bar that offers great sparkling wine or cava by the glass is awesome in my book. . We ordered the margherita and soppressata pizzas to share. My mom tried the house salad and my dad and I split the caprese with prosciutto. Both the salad and caprese dish were delicious. Where some felt the house salad fell short without adequate dressing, we found it perfectly dressed. All the flavors of the spicy greens paired with the currants were present without the dressing taking over the entire dish. And there was no trace of the overuse of oil. I often make vinaigrettes at home and find a lot of restaurants do them wrong. They are actually more oil than anything else, but must be properly emulsified to taste balanced. The caprese was awesome with thick slices of house-made mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes and a light drizzle of balsamic reduction. The dish also came with two hunks of freshly baked bread and a mound of some of the best prosciutto I've had in a long time. The pizzas were perfectly cooked right in front of us in their 800+ degree wood stone oven. The crusts were perfectly bubbled and chewy without being too thick or thin. The sauce was well-balanced and you could taste their house-made mozzarella melted on top. . Something tells me I'm going to have a hard time convincing my family to try any other restaurants next time we have plans to eat out in Lakewood.","I ordered 2 xl pizzas, the Mama Mia and the grilled garlic chicken. They were incredible. I ordered them earlier in the morning to be ready at 11:30 for lunch. When I walked in a few minutes before 11:30 they were just coming out of the oven. They were hot and fresh. Great service. Everyone on my crew loved the pizza. I will definitely be back","Ok for $5 - 6  but not good pizza, no  flavor,  good for young children or anyone else who likes bland pizza!  If they want to charge extra for thin crust they should put it in writing! I would rather give my $5. 00 to Little Cesar's!","Angelia`s Pizza is a very solid go-to pie at a pretty reasonable price. Try some of the specialty pizzas you cannot go wrong! It would be nice to have a dining room to sit down and eat after the Moon games and practices!  We will continue to enjoy your pizza!","I'm giving this place 5 stars not because it's perfect, but because I love it. I have been there twice, and both times I had a great experience. To be fair,  both times were during a quiet time (sunday evening), but I found nothing lacking.  . Since the place is indoor/outdoors, there is no air conditioning, but the server was happy to point a fan in our direction when we asked, and kept our water glasses full the whole time. She was attentive without being annoying, and as I former server I am hyper aware of the quality of service at an establishment.  . Food was timed perfectly and the portions were great - I kept some for lunch the next day. The sangria was lovely - clearly made with good wine - and the calamari appetizer was fresh and tender. My companion had a tikka masala pizza and I had the Madras chicken. It was great - it had just enough heat to be flavourful without being overly spicey.  . This was the perfect place to have dinner after seeing the Picasso exhibition at the AGO, and I'm really glad we chose this place.","Great place to watch a movie. Love the reclining seats and all the extra room compared to other theaters. Last time I went, I ordered pizza which was delivered to my seat. It was surprisingly good and inexpensive","Love their food and their prices. The owners and staff are very friendly. Their specials are great too. Their pizza and wings are my favorite in Vegas.","Best pizza place in Vegas . They have really great costumer service. They take the time to speak with you and get to know you. I would really recommend to stop by and try their pizza. My favorite is The Real Deal, it's the real deal.","I think that's the greasiest pizza I have ever had. It was dripping everywhere on us while we were trying to eat it. And $14 for two pieces of pizza and a soda is a little high, although they were big slices. Stood waiting for a few minutes with no other customers before someone helped me. She was very nice though.","This is one of the best New York style pizza I ever had and the guys are very nice. I definitely will come back to this place.","I used to like the pizza from here. Last time I ordered it was still doughy and I had to cook longer. Today it was ice cold. Not even lukewarm. My kid was screaming for pizza so I didn't send it back. But, I won't ever order from here again. $31 plus tip for a cold pizza and cold soup. There was a piece of \"garlic bred\". It was half a sub roll uncooked with some garlic butter on it. Yum. Should have had a can of Progresso and a frozen pizza and saved $25. Wait, I could have saved $35. I tipped $10. I figure a poor kid driving his own car deserves a decent tip. I called to let them know and she said sorry we can replace the pizza. My kid ate the cold thing anyway. And who wants to wait another hour for the replacement? Blah. Next time I'll drive my lazy self over to Bonnanos and pick up a pizza myself.","Delicious pizza! I had the Lambretta special pizza, minus the prosciutto because I was in the mood for vegetarian (I'm sure it's delicious with the prosciutto too though). It was HUGE but it was thin crust and it was all I was having and I was hungry so I ate the whole thing myself!. The service was very fast and friendly, and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant were very pleasant and modern. . I will definitely come back here! The pizza was made from high quality, authentic ingredients, and I didn't feel stuffed in a bad way like I do at other pizza places. I felt great afterwards.","I stopped in at this restaurant for a quick lunch. I have never been here before, but knew it had been here for some time. I asked the male and female counter attendants about their slice pizza and was told $4. 99 including drink. They told me the slice was 1/4 of an extra large pizza. I ordered a slice and drink. After about 10 minutes the slice was delivered to me. I instantly asked the server if this was the 1/4 of an extra large pizza. I was told yes. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. The slice was mostly outer edge crust that barely done. The rest was a very small triangle. The sauce was sweet tomato-e. The cheese topping was a mix of mozzarella and provolone. The cheese was of poor quality and sparse. There was paper thin pepperoni on top. It was not worth $1. 00 much less $3. 99 (without drink). Employees did not seem to care. I will not return!","The place doesn't look the best but food is excellent and the service is fantastic!  My husband always gets pizza or open face roast beef n gravy. I get lasagna (which gives me 3meals) or a sandwich. My granddaughter's love to go there. They get there own personal pizza which is huge. Big Jim's was also on \"Diners, Drive in and Dives\". Guy showed the spaghetti being made, he gave the recipe. Also, I forgot to mention they have the best wedding soup in Pittsburgh.","Went there for lunch on Tuesday. Had the gnocchi and it was quite good. Service was very fast. We got in around 11:55 and finished eating by 12:20. My boss had a pizza which he couldn't finish. . Overall it was very good but still a bit over-priced due to the location. Plus it gets quite loud during lunch time.","It's not that I'm 9 months pregnant that I was able to eat an entire pizza here, but that the pizza here is THAT good! First time trying it but will be back again (soon I hope)! Very clean place, very friendly guys helping us with how to order and very good pizza (had I mentioned that?). Many thumbs up CBP!!!","I have found my new favourite restaurant in Calgary! After a girlfriend suggested Cibo for our dinner date, I admit I was less than thrilled. Although I had heard good things, a quick menu check online didn't really excite me, I found nothing to be that interesting or drool worthy. Nevertheless, there we were. We were seated upstairs at a lovely table near the bar, and I was already hooked. The decor and ambiance of this restaurant is perfect. Although it is loud (almost too loud, which would be my only complaint), it's very energetic and fun. We ordered the aranchini to share, as well as the mixed greens and the prosciutto and pineapple pizza. Everything was absolutely fantastic. We also split two desserts and each had a chocolate martini. Our server was the sweetest little thing and everything came out perfectly timed and expertly cooked. I was blown away, so I took my boyfriend back the very next week. We also shared the aranchini and mixed greens, but we had the lamb meatballs and the spaghetti for 2 meal. Once again, I was blown away by the quality of the food, service, and price! It is seriously a steal to eat here. I am absolutely in LOVE with Cibo and I will make it a point to return again and again!","I really enjoy the food, can't say the same about their service. I waited an hour and 20 minutes for two pizzas and when they finally arrived they were incredibly cold! Not a happy customer.","My family and I love this place, which was formerly Brooklyn Brothers. With the change in name and management, things have only gotten better. My favorite is the Eggplant Parmesan. Be sure to ask for Nona's sauce, which is chunky and sweet. The pizza is also great and they now deliver, which is nice for evenings in.","Excellent place for real Italian food!!!. If you are looking for a REAL Italian family style restaurant, this is THE PLACE!!!. The setting is like being in Italy. You will love the atmosphere. Great experience.  . This is the best place we have been in Las Vegas. The service was perfect!! We made a reservation and had to queue only for 3 minutes, when the restaurant was flooded by customers arriving from everywhere. We had the pasta which is unique, a sublime pizza, an amazing tiramis\u00f9 and cannoli (The list of pastries is delicious) and as we were really happy with the table we got, we decide to get an Italian red wine Chianti. . Excellent service, food and atmosphere. Thank you Ninni, Pasquale and Milena. . I wish you al the best!!","Libertine Social is a fancy gastropub that is a great place to catch up with friends. Though it is a little pricey for a gastropub, the food is pretty tasty. . The House Baked Pretzel was baked perfectly, allowing the dough to be light and soft. The cheddar fondue was the right amount of gooey-ness and was a delicious dip to the pretzel. The Wood Grilled Sausages were a good sampler of different types of sausages, which were all grilled to perfection, giving the sausages a smokey kick. . The Black Truffle Pizza had a good ratio of fontina and Parmesan, giving it a nice cheesy and stringy consistency, which is always nice to have with your pizza. The pizza was topped with slivers of truffles, which accentuated the delicious flavors of the cheese. But my personal favorite was the Fennel and Sausage flatbread. The flatbread was thing and crispy, while the sausage was very flavorful and had the right amount of saltiness that was noticeable with the notes of honey that was on the flatbread. . If you have friends coming into town, Libertine Social is a great place to have some food and drinks while catching up.","Not sure why all the bad reviews. I've been ordering pizza from this location for a decade and have never had a problem.","Great pizza but lacks consistency. Lots of toppings to choose  from. Needs more choices  in dipping sauces.","Best Gluten free vegan pizza in the world!!!","Absolutely avoid this place it's a last resort for me and even then I regret it. Undercooked pizza sparse toppings and the rudest employee ever. They need to just shut this place down I've given them so many second chances and will never do it again. When you complain to corporate they send a free pizza for the same location -- how dumb!!! I hope they shut down and something decent fills this prime spot.","Waiter was over the top cheesy. Talked too much. A bit obnoxious. . No gluten-free options for pizza or pasta (Ferro's on St. Clair offers gluten-free options that are amazing - go there instead if you eat gluten-free). . One of the specials had risotto as a side so I asked if I could just have a small bowl of the risotto as my main and the waiter said no - didn't even go check with the kitchen - flat out no. Treated me like I was asking them to make risotto from scratch. . So I ordered a steak instead which was good but if I wanted steak would have gone to the keg in the first place. . Marcello's is clearly stuck in the past. . . . no variety for those with dietary restrictions.","Super delicious ! Now I wish I could of taken a picture of the pizza and cheesesteaks. But they were gone before another thought came up. Fresh ingredients, big slices and friendly staff. My new local go to spot for pizza !!","We headed in for lunch on a weekday, and were seated right away. Our server's name was Chris, and he was very prompt and courteous. We each ordered pizza and shared and it was fantastic! The Diavallo and the Boss were SO good. The Margherita wasn't bad either. I can't wait to go back and try some more!","Did not expect it to be a fast food restaurant but it is. Their fish tacos are spicy and pretty good. Their regular tacos are good and made with homemade tortillas. The salsa bar has a good verity and a lot of didn't spice. The quesadillas are enough to feed you entire family!  It comes in a freaking pizza box.  lol","We ate there Friday night and it was an absolute delight. . Scott the owner, the staff and the d\u00e9cor was very inviting. . The pizza was very good. The combination of the tasty crust, the right amount of sauce and a fresh mozzarella along with quality toppings makes it the best pizza I've had in Arcadia area. It was even tasty the next day. . What I liked about it the most is that they're not trying to be a fancy place or going all snobby on the food as the Arcadia area restaurants do way too much. They obviously just want to be a pizza parlor offering a good pizza, at a fair price and they seem to be doing a good job of it. . They also have BYOB, you can bring in your own bottle of wine or beer and drink it with your food. I don't why but I find this kind of cool. We will definitely be back.","I heard this place was good and it was. I ordered a personal sized cheese pizza with no extra toppings for $7. 50. and it was good. They make it like Pizza Brutta on Monroe St, where instead of being covered with a layer of cheese it has a few dollops. Novonta pulls that off (Pizza Brutta did too). Novonta's crust was good, and the rest of the pizza was even better. I really got just a plain cheese pizza, but there was more to it. Some sort of Basil or Spinach leaves in there. . . I don't know but it was good. It also only took like 2 minutes to make.","Short list:. Great location. Great design and environment  . Attentive staff and manager. Poor food. Let me say the people are great! The staff really care for their patrons and it is greatly appreciated. . Unfortunately the food is not up to par as the location and design. Coming here for a quick beer and getaway, I order the pizza bites as a way sample their dough. 4 pizza pockets for $6 dollars seems reasonable but as I ate, I found that it was unfortunately not worth the money. The bottoms are soggy and the chef even had the gall to place a pizza pocket that was hallow. I understand that the chef is new, but that is unacceptable. I mean, I hate to say this, but hot pocket does a better job than this sad Appetizer. I want this place to do well, but please take pride in your food and never send out something that is short of a standard you want it to be.","My wife and I visited East West Pizza because we purchased a restaurant. com gift certificate for $2 and we've been questing to find decent pizza in the area. . Our meal here was mediocre. We were pleased by the option to have the crust well done (my wife had hers done this way, while I stuck with the regular crust), but the taste was just bland and uninteresting -- totally lacking in the sort of flavour punch that makes a really good pizza. . I wasn't going to bother writing a review of the place as pizza is a pretty subjective area, however several months ago I received a spam email from East West -- I must have filled out some comment card or something so, I emailed them and asked them nicely to remove me from their list. They replied, very apologetic, and promised to do so. . For the next several months, despite this guarantee, I continued to receive spam in my email from East West. I emailed them again, this time asking more forcefully to be removed from their list and received no reply - just more spam over the next month or two. Tonight I emailed centurylink, their email host, and reported them for spamming. . East West Pizza - two stars for mediocre pizza that I never feel the need to taste again, minus one star for being spammers.","$3 a slice, lots of cheese. Not familiar with the Calgary area, we were a couple from out of province, kind of lost while house hunting that just needed a quick lunch on the go. We were very satisfied with the pepperoni pizza. The slices are HUGE and my husband stated the person behind the counter was very nice. . My only wish is that per slice, more pizzerias would carry veggie options. Veggie rocks and keeps that guilt meter down a bit when eating pizza!!!","I don't get the hype. Sure the pita bread is good, the produce is fresh, the portion sizes are large and the service quick,  but I found the overall experience to be nothing more than mediocre. The gyro was bland, the feta and olives were nothing more than grocery store passable, and the seasoning was non-existent. . Perhaps I am overly critical, having eaten at great Greek restaurants in other cities (I've noticed that ethnic places - Mexican aside - are over rated across the board in Phx), but as a 'Greek' restaurant this place falls flat. However, as it is a change from the ordinary casual dining venues, and is close to home, I'll likely be back, but next time I'll choose the pizza or pasta, (with a side of pita) as the Greek and 'Crazy' salads did nothing for me.","It's a local favorite for people who live in the Cave Creek area. The building is split into two venues. One side is the coffee side. It opens for those who need an early coffee and maybe a pastry. They also offer a simple menu of oatmeal, egg/bacon or sausage or what they call their \"Big Ass\" Burrito. They also have a \"Small Ass\" Burrito if you're not that hungry. The coffee is their own and  is roasted on the premises. I love the smell of it when I drive through the town. Their coffee offerings are equal to what you would find at Starbuck's but they also have some items unique to them. Their \"Mocaffe\" (Mexican spiced hot chocolate) is one of my faves. . The wine side is open for lunch/dinner time. The menus are small, and most items would be considered appetizers. However, the menu is unique enough that you feel like you are getting a little something special. It's always fun to make a meal of apps. Good sandwiches too. They also do a decent pizza. . Monday nights, they offer a $5 price on many of their wines. It's a good time to try some labels that maybe you aren't used to. . The free WI-FI is a definite plus. The ambiance is wonderful, overstuffed chairs, art and entertainment in the evening. I think you'll be pleased.","I have been going to the RWB in Mesa since it opened and the food is pretty darn good. As a vegetarian I have tried every possible combination of food on the menu that is vegetarian, but I typically will just stick to the pizzas and salad. The eggplant Florentine is very good too, but the serving is enough to get you through 4 meals!  That is true with most of their food, the portions are large, so don't be turned off by the prices. I would have to agree on the comments below on the service; it's nothing to write home about. The only thing I will say is that I know several people who are regulars at the brew and they are treated like gold. . . so maybe there's something us occasional patrons are missing. If you are area, I would definitely recommend RWB.","Great place. I went there on the opening weekend and they had a waiting list. It did seem a little disorganized, people going this way, people going that way, I can't count that against them though. I am sure it will probably become a well oiled machine in the coming month or so. The one and only complaint I have is the wait for a pizza! There is a warning on the menu saying that there is a 40-60 minute wait for the pizza because it's hand made. . . really, an hour!? I love pizza and Uncle Bears, which is a 15 foot walk has equally as good of pizza when you consider that it's ready in 10 minutes. That said everyone was very nice.","Yes! I'm officially addicted to this pizza. Honestly, the only good New York style pizza in Madison. I'm originally from New Jersey (yes, I am aware that is *not* New York) so I've missed a good thin crust. . So far, the eggplant pizza is my favorite. I mean, I've liked all the ones I had. I think the ratio of the ingredients is good. . I ordered a salad yesterday to pretend like I was being healthy in addition to the giant slice of pizza I was going to consume. They give a good amount of salad! The feta in the Mediterranean salad is super yummy, though on the salty side. . I went there again today, after ordering delivery yesterday. I don't plan on going tomorrow, but we will see.","Staff is always nice and their pizza is awesome! The wings are good too! And so many other things! Great place to eat.","I like to bowl about once a year &amp; this fit the bill!  We went on a Thursday afternoon &amp; they had a special to bowl unlimited games with unlimited pizza for two hours for $14/pp. We weren't hungry &amp; said no to the special until she told us the total ($70???) so we got the special &amp; just didn't have pizza. The alley is nice &amp; they played an excellent mix of music with the videos on the big screens at the end of the alley (even a Jerry Lee Lewis video from the 50's!!!)  They even have a \"jukebox to choose music from. The staff was pleasant &amp; very helpful &amp; even picked out the perfect ball for me before I even asked (they are behind the counter). They have 1/2 sized shoes so we bowled away &amp; had a great time!  (I broke 100 twice &amp; my sweetie broke 150!)  The were several people/families bowling &amp; everyone was polite &amp; appropriately behaved (always a plus)","DO NOT RENT AN APARTMENT HERE.  Law students who really want litigation experience may want to consider it because this place screams \"sue me\" on a regular basis. . 1. LIES, DAMN LIES - The employees will lie to you, without a doubt. I have lost count of the number of times I have been lied to while living here. We were lied to about the ability to get satellite TV installed, about the state of our apartment on moving in, about regularity of the bus (forget it when school is not in session), the safety of the place, and about so much more. . 2. FEES WITHOUT SERVICES - The Village has no qualms about charging a fee for a service they do not provide. We sublet initially and were told we would have to pay a redecoration fee and would have to leave at least two days between the prior tenant's move-out and our move-in so they could \"redecorate\". When we arrived, of course, the place had not been cleaned let alone redecorated. When we asked about this, we were told that they never redecorate in sublet situations. You should not be surprised to hear that the sublessor was not refunded her redecoration fee and neither were we. In addition, a number of friends were assessed charges for things they had not done, including fines for leaving trash out. Very questionable behavior. . 3. CRIME - Numerous cars had their back windows shot-out while I have been living here, at least three by my count. The Village refused to do anything in response. . 4. THERE ARE NO SOCCER FIELDS OR BASKETBALL COURTS BEHIND THE VILLAGE - When we signed up, we were shown a nice diagram of Colbert park with all of its facilities, including a soccer field, a basketball court, and an amphitheater. These things do not exist. There is some grass and a hill, but it takes some imagination to conjure up what the Village subtly advertises. . If you're the kind of person who is willing to forgive all manner of misbehavior in exchange for a pool and pizza party every once in a while then by all means move in here. . As a final note, both the Village drivers and maintenance staff are perfectly friendly and seem competent enough. This review is limited to a critique of the management and office staff who ought to be ashamed of their behavior.","My fiance ordered from here recently. After waiting almost 2 hours for our pizza to arrive, we called and asked what was going on, they said it would be there soon. Ten to fifteen minutes later it shows up and the driver informed us that they forgot to make the pizza. Any to top it all off we received some cardboard with a thousand dried up pepperoni slices on it. Wouldn't recommend","A nice little quaint Italian restaurant. It's family owned and they take pride in making amazing delicious Italian dishes. The service staff is friendly and very attentive. . Pizza crust is the closest I have had to NY style pizza. Good sauce and fresh toppings. Their pasta sauces are delicious.  . Will definitely keep coming back. I would recommend.","First time eating here and was very impressed with \"The Cheef\" sandwich, great flavor. Friends said the pizza was really good too.","Vegan options in downtown Vegas!!! Pizza was super tasty and the service was pretty decent. Half way through baking my pie they remembered that I only wanted mushrooms on half, so they took it out of the oven and picked them off. Kind of weird, but whatever. Nice gesture, but paws off my pizza! Lol.","I'm just in the area for the day. . . Showing some houses to some buyer clients and needed a place to stop for lunch between appointments. I ate too much. This Brother's is not as good as a similar place on Peoria. . . But it was decent. I would eat here again if driving by and in the mood for pizza. My Pepsi tasted fine. The girl who took my order was happy &amp; pleasant. I got my soda topped off before I left and I got two sides of ranch at no charge. . . The only thing I was out off by was that I'm glad I didn't have to pay for the ranch because they were both half full which is why I needed two. If I had paid for them, I would have said something. I'm full, happy and ready for a nap. . . Oh! Need to show houses. . . . I ordered the two slices of cheese and a Pepsi and my total was $4. 38. Um I went to the bathroom before leaving, . . The door didn't lock and toilet sprayed water (yes toilet water) at me and did not flush properly. . . Hopefully they get that fixed!","Stopped here Saturday afternoon for an early dinner on a one day Vegas turn around. Just happened to be driving buy and noticed it. A new place that we hadn't seen before. Glad we stopped. Normal pub type food. Good fish tacos and hand made pizza. Great atmopsphere and the service was prompt and friendly. And the beer. . . . nice and cold. Definately wouldl visist here again.","Authentic Italian pizza made with fresh ingredients! Do yourself a favor and place an order tonight! Personally love the Quattro Formaggio pizza!","2 stars. The pizza is ridiculously overpriced, $17 for an 11-inch pizza?. Our server was a little aggressive, he even complained about his other customers to us. Who knew what he was saying about us? He also must have thought we were stupid because he kept explaining the difference between sausage  and pepperoni? REALLY?. The server really ruined this meal for us, he even tried some adult humor with the serving of the beer. I'll leave it at that. So the food never had a chance, we just wanted to leave. . If you eat here. . . take your time, the pizza comes out real fast. . Being from New Jersey, we know and appreciate good pizza. . . this was mediocre at best. . We won't be returning.","Who doesn't love Joe's? It goes without saying that this place is great. Their garlic fries put Gilroy to shame, the onion rings are devilish, all of their shakes are top-notch. Then there's the beet salad and grilled veggie pizza. . . I could go on forever. . This quaint farm house turned restaurant really has it figured out. . And I always go next door to the Coffee Shop for an after-lunch/dinner latte.","Great late night stop. The building is gorgeous with the open industrial feel. Late night they have pizza specials and an awesome DJ. I liked the lounge feel! The service was super slow and it took forever for drinks, but once we got them they were great. Worth checking out!","I called in for delivery and waited an hour for them to deliver my pizza which yes they might have been busy I understand but when they drop it off I didn't take a look at the pizza because I was working and put it in the back in the break room as soon as I went to go get a slice the entire pizza was burned and it looked old. I waited an hour at least you guys should have made sure my pizza was not burn and at least somewhat fresh. It's so mess up. They wouldn't even give my money back.","This is my families pizza haven - and we try and get here once a week!. Everyone who works here is friendly, nice &amp; really wants you to have a great time. They are constantly coming up weekly pizza, salad &amp; appetizer specials that are different and wonderful. The \"wedge\" salad was one of my favorites!. They also have great patio seating as well.","After seeing Hash House A Go Go on a Food Network show, my hubby wanted to go for the famous chicken and waffles for Sunday brunch. . We arrived around 10:40 and were immediately seated Ina large booth in the corner. Our friendly server came over right away and took drinks orders while explaining a few particularly popular many items. . Items chosen; chicken waffles (he loved it), apple-cinnamon pancake (yummy and seriously the size of a medium pizza!), kids hamburger (huge, said to be a little oily tasting), and egg white scramble with avocado and sweet potato fries (good). . While the portions are easily large enough for 2 people to share, one will not be disappointed if comfort foods is your hankering.","Upper Crust is like Grimaldi's on steroids. The two places have nearly identical decor and the pizza is extremely similar. Upper Crust uses a little more cheese which is nice, but they also use cornmeal on the crust which I am not crazy about. The wings are huge and delicious, especially with the honey BBQ sauce. The meatballs are nothing special (with or without the mozzarella cheese), but Stephanie H would disagree. Happy hour is Monday-Friday 4pm to 7pm and on Wednesdays they offer half off on bottles of wine. . Overall, it is a very good pizza and I plan on returning. Next time I'll be giving that pizza cookie a try. I really liked Upper Crust, but Grimaldi's in Old Town is still my favorite for traditional NY style thin crust pizza.","New location for this burger franchise by the original owner. Place is really clean and freshly remodeled. Classy for a burger joint. Modern. Extensive menu covers way more than burgers. I'm told plans are to add pizza and wings next. . The food was fresh, quick, hot and delicious. My burger was cooked med to med rare. I can attest that they use quality ingredients. Fries were fresh and flavorful. Perfectly salted. Burger was pretty big. Much larger than fast food places. . Staff dressed in uniform. Not sure if they always do this, but it wasn't too busy when I was here at 3pm, and they were bringing food to the tables. Drive through opening soon, and delivery. . . This place will be unstoppable. Great addition to downtown.","I have to say that not only is the food amazing, the employees are extremely friendly. They went as far to fulfill my request to draw John Snow from Game of Thrones (easily the best pizza place EVER!) Thank you so much!","Ordered today for lunch for delivery to my workplace. My boss treated us to lunch since it was my birthday. Ordered online and delivery was 6 minutes later than they said it would be but all the food was correct and delicious!  I got a large supreme pizza, lots of wings, and a cookie for under $50 bucks and it fed the whole office. Delivery dude was nice.","This place is always great my husband and I love ordering from them not only are they extremely fast when it comes to delivery but they are SUPER friendly their pizza is top notch whenever I take a bite I feel like I'm in Italy! This is the place to order from if you don't feel like cooking and are too much of a bum to go outside :)","I've been to Rudino's a couple times with coworkers. It's a pretty solid lunch joint: the centerpiece is the pizza buffet, although both times I've gone, I've ordered salads. Their salads are atypically good for an establishment like this: there's actually more to them than iceberg lettuce and ranch. However, I am only giving Rudino's two stars because they are pricey (which, admittedly, is fairly typical for that part of town) and the service is on the slow side.","I do not recommend going to this location what so ever. Please drive a little out of your way and avoid this location. Absolutely nothing hot n ready. While waiting 20 minutes for two pizzas one pep bestest the other a cheese bestest one would think the pizzas would be hot but they were room temp with no pizza sauce and hardly any cheese. Please do not waste your money and time here. I grew up with little Caesars and have been to many in different states over the past 15 years and I have never had such a bad experience food wise I have never left a little Caesars Pizza and thought I was ripped off but this location had me felling like I was ripped off which I was and you will be too. Please go to any other location do not waste your time or money at this location.","This place is hit or miss depending on who's working, and tonight was a miss. Pizza Nova is by far the best chain pizza store, and they're usually pretty consistent, but this place is the worst one I've ever frequented. The pizza tonight tasted almost like nothing. Not sure why the couple who own the place refuse to put more than an ounce of sauce on the pizza, but that's what you basically get from them. You dont even taste the sauce, that's how little they put. The lack of sauce throws off the whole balance of what a pizza is, so all you taste is dough, cheese, and toppings. It's more like a sandwich with no condiments than a pizza. We didn't even bother finishing the whole thing, which is unheard of in our household, that's how bland it was. If there was a better option in the area I wouldn't bother with this place, sadly there isn't.","Excellent thin crust pizzas with great toppings and an ok selection of local craft beers. Take away a giant slice for $5!. Absolutely the most affordable dining option at aria. And the monopoly machines are right outside too!","New to the area and had a papa johns in so-cal I loved. This place is decent if you want chain pizza at a good price.","This a great little neighborhood sports bar. It's our go-to place for UFC events. The place is clean &amp; comfortable, with a nice ambiance and we've always had good service (even on crazy fight nights when the placed is packed). We have found the prices to be a little high for a sports bar style menu, but when you consider they don't charge a cover fee for UFC events &amp; sometimes have coupons, it's not too bad. . The food isn't 5 star amazing, but it's pretty solid for a joint like this. We've tried probably about half the stuff on the menu in the years we've been visiting Augie's. For the appetizers, the egg-roll-wrapped mozz sticks &amp; pretzel sticks are the best of the bunch. Their wings are run-of-the-mill &amp; sadly they don't offer variable heat levels on the buffalo style (it's a soft medium IMO).  The burgers &amp; sandwiches are mostly good, but not exceptional. The best things on the menu are the ribs &amp; pizza. The ribs are baked/grilled style rather than smoked, but they're super tender with a sweet sauce &amp; fall off the bone. The pizza is probably our favorite thing at Augie's. If fact, I'd even say I was kinda shocked at how good it was when we first tried it. The crust is a bit bready, but it really works with the sauce &amp; cheese they use. It's definitely worth a try. Pro tip - order it \"well done\" to get a nice slightly charred edge. For dessert, the chocolate brownie sundae thing is surprisingly awesome. It's simple, but good &amp; surely plentiful. . All in all, we're lucky to have a joint like this out in the far west valley. They have friendly service, show UFC fights for free, and the food is above-average for this kind of place.","I ordered dinner using the Just Eat app, where they have free delivery for orders over $20. . I ordered the Veggie spring rolls, honey garlic chicken, and pineapple chicken fried rice. It was decent - the honey garlic chicken was a bit sweeter than I was expecting and too much breading but still tasted okay. The rice was my favourite - lots of pineapple and fair amount of chicken. I'll probably order food here again, but not the honey garlic chicken. . Delivery was quick and the food was hot and fresh when it arrived. The driver was very friendly and I tipped him on the Just Eat app when I paid on there. It made the transaction very simple - as soon as he arrived with my food, I didn't have to try and hold everything while paying on a mobile machine at the front door like when you order pizza.","Really bad experience here. Went in at 6pm for a drink and asked about dueling pianos. They start @ 8pm. Ok. We had two drinks and were hungry. Asked if we could get pizza from across the way and bring in. Yes that was fine. Get your hand stamped so u can come back in. We got pizza (worst ever) and were then told we could not bring it in. Had to sit outside and they were closing the bar for half an hour while they set up. Ate and then got in line to go back in. No charge since we had our hand stamped. Tried to fit at a table and were told NO we had to stand. The tables were reserved!  Nowhere did it state that we needed a reservation nor did the bartender tell us that. Total bullshit way to treat customers who spent $50 on two drinks each!  EXTREMELY disappointed. Sucks","Visited here on Sunday. It is very simple, breakfast with little pizzazz. It was very unflavorful. I ordered Eggs scrambled, Sausage Links, and \"Cheese Grits\". (Cheese Grits to them means a sliver of fake American cheese is a type of processed cheese -- you know the type from the cellophane wrapper)  -- placed on top. YUCK.  Hands down one of the biggest disappointments for a breakfast place in Charlotte. Especially near Stonecrest. Parking is awful (near Trader Joe's). Staff was friendly but I would Pass this one up with all the better options in the area . . . . . . . .","Ordered from Caliente on a weeknight, and it took an hour and a half to get the pizza. When we finally got the pizza it was cold. I was hopeful that after waiting so long the pizza would be worth the wait but was left disappointed. The toppings were decent but the dough tasted just like the big chains.  . Bottom line - if you want a passable pizza delivered ice cold in two hours this is your place, otherwise you are better off going somewhere else.","Giordano's is a great Italian/Chicago style restaurant that I highly recommend! The negative reviews on this place's wait times and busyness should not count against it. This restaurant just opened no more than 5 months ago, it is located on the busy P83 strip with tons of people and near the Arrowhead Mall, and is only a moderate sized restaurant. . When my husband and I first arrived we heard the wait was almost 2 hours but for a party of 5+ - for just me and my husband we were sat right away. Large families/parties need to realize that places that have just opened up are going to be super busy and have long wait times - its common sense. We sat at a small side table and were not too shocked at how busy and compacted everyone was. We expected it and were happy to see all the buzz around the place. Our waiter got our drinks immediately and walked us through the menu. He warned us about a large party that had just arrived and that we needed to put any pizza order in soon other wise it would be over an hour wait for a Chicago style pizza. . My husband and I wanted to go a different route and ordered a pasta and sandwich instead. The wait time on the pizza was not a negative strike to us - we knew hand making a pizza from scratch takes time and we were more interested in the other dishes anyways. My husband ordered the Italian Beef Sandwich and I ordered the Marinara Spaghetti while we shared the Giordano's Sampler. The food was FANTASTIC and i'll be posting pictures of it too. It was rich and flavorful with a real taste of care and love. The only negative part of the meal was that everything came out all together and quite quickly. I believe my husband and I waited just over 10 minutes to get our appetizers, salads, and entrees. Our table almost couldn't fit it all. I ended up having to not finish my salad because I did not want my entree to get cold. . Other than that my husband and I had a great meal and really enjoyed the atmosphere. We also appreciated our waiter and his thoughts in items on the menu that were best for us and our time frame. I will definitely be back to have more from this delicious establishment - but with a party no larger than 3 I think for the next few months.","TLDR: Great spot for a slice of late night pizza on De la Montagne just under St. Catherine. . Pizza Chez Danny makes tasty pizza that will squash your late night craving. The crust is thin and crisp on the bottom, but soft on top. The addition of sesame seeds on the top adds a delicious nuttiness to every bite of the sweet crust. The mixed cheese of the simple cheese pizza melts into yummy goodness and sits on a light dose of tomato sauce. With tax, the slice came out to around $3, and it was delicious. I definitely recommend this place for your Americanized pizza itch.","Came here after soaking up the sun in the Aria where we were staying in las vegas. We were going for a later meal, wanted something casual that wasn't a buffet and one of the casino employees mentioned this place had good pizza so the other non-New Yorkers were lured in (as someone who has had fantastic pizza here in NYC and Chicago I was skeptical). . We were promptly seated (for a party of 8 we had our own private dining area), and our waitress was very prompt and attentive to our table. They have a small menu, but it catered to our different dietary restrictions (some were doing a Paeleo diet, some were doing low carb, some were vegetarian. . . it's hard to please 8 women sometimes!). . I ended up getting the sausage and peppers sandwich, the well suited, and a few of us tried the margharetia pizza . The drink was nice and strong, and was the best part of my meal. The sausage and peppers sandwich was flavorful, though the amount of bread was overwhelming to the amount of sausage and pepers within the sandwich so it was mostly bread. The pizza, though we requested it be cut in 8 (usually their pies are cut in 6), was cut oddly so it wasn't an equitable division of pizza amongst our party (so we ended up cutting some slices in half), however the taste was bland and the crust though well done on the edges, could have been cooked a bit more and tasted a bit raw. . So for a quick casual bite I would say ok, however this wouldn't rank very highly in my list of places to eat while in Vegas.","Before you eat here you have to know that this restaurant has been around for 37 YEARS! That is amazing for any restaurant. Restaurants come and go, but this one has stood the test of time. . . and you\"ll definitely notice that the decor, although clean and super comfortable, is understatedly retro. . I liked the vibe here. There's a fair sized restaurant area and a large lounge with a cozy brick fireplace. It's usually packed Friday and Saturday nights. . The owner's son played with the Calgary Stampeders once upon a time, so there's lots of Stampeder memorabilia. It wouldn't be completely unrealistic to see some football players digging into some steaks while you're eating. . My friends and I had pizza, Greek salad and Caesar salad. The Greek Salad was delicious and had some bonus creaminess to it. The Caesar (large) was nice and garlicky and came with a generous side of garlic toast. . We had the Ambrosia pizza (think spinach, artichoke hearts  feta) and the Athenian pizza (think feta and olives). Both had toppings that blended together in the most amazing way! I would order both again. . Service was great - attentive, polite and friendly. . This restaurant has a solid menu; is comfortable and laid back; and has some friendly employees who obviously enjoy what they do.","We came here before a concert at Consol Center. It's across the street, it was very packed, so leave yourself a lot of time to get a table if you want to eat here. We got lucky &amp; got a table only hour before the concert!! We ordered a pizza &amp; it was good for a bar. Good selection of beers!!","This is one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurants. We ordered pizza , salad and a sandwich. After over 45 minutes of patiently waiting and no comment from server in what the delay was, we asked the manger about our food. He said he was too busy to help us. He said he would be with us in 10-15 minutes. If we didn't want to wait, we were more than welcome to leave. Who treats customers like that? I told the server we were leaving and left cash for the drinks. She just shrugged her shoulders and said \"do what you have to\". I don't think I gave been treated so poorly as a paying customer in my life. The management is an embarrassment and service, all around was horrendous. What a disappointment.","Super yummy pizzas and salads! Not a ton of seating area indoors. Bar across the hall so you can get any drink you like.","Four stars because this place is an institution. Not just fries, but a BAG of fries. Be prepared to share with everyone you know and even someone you don't know. The pizzas also aren't bad, especially for the price, but late at night, be prepared to wait awhile while all the other drunken patrons are getting their own food.  . Oh, the store is not the best place to actually eat you food, but just take it home and start that second party.","My favourite Superstore in the city, and clearly, the only one I go to. . The reason I love this particular location so much is because it's in a good area (Edgemont), the crowd isn't sketchy (like I sometimes find it to be in the other locations of Superstore) and depending on which day you go, it's not always insanely packed. I also love that they always carry every single last item on my grocery list, including the items on my 'Indian shopping list' such as basmati rice and chickpea flour. The produce section is always well stocked and it's rare that they run out of items before restocking them. The prices are always reasonable and they carry Joe Fresh clothing which I love to peruse!. The parking situation is also good and it's located in the Country Hills Plaza so you can pick up movie rentals, drop off your dry cleaning, pick up some pizza and even grab a couple of blizzards from Dairy Queen on your way home :). I've missed this Superstore in my years away and I'm planning to make up for lost time in the upcoming weeks :) . See you there.","I have no idea of the history of this place, but it has one. They also use the same sourdough starter for the pizzas for about 50 years. The waitress explained this too me, but all i know is the pizza turned out pretty good. Our version had giant pieces of pepperoni, a dabble of grilled jalapeno and purple onion. This not really NY style as I was barely able to fold the thing, but it was all about that sourdough crust. In a surprise though, the pizza did not taste good reheated. Another surprise was the \"check in\" on facebook and get an order of chicken tenders for $2. These were small, hot and crunchy little tenders which were quite good. They have an upstairs with games and of course all the funky stuff is fun to check out. Half the patio is covered also, so that is a good thing.","Great for a birthday party. My daughter and a few of her friends has food allergies. The cook, Joe, came out and told us he made sure there wasn't any cross contamination on the 3 pizzas. Jonathan, the event coordinator was accommodating. He took the time for my daughter's dietary needs. The waitress, Ebony, was nice at first. Then through out the party she didn't fill up pitchers for the kids and didn't listen to me when I asked her to put everyone's order in our bill. She looked annoyed. But over all I give Gameworks 5 stars. Joe and Jonathan made up for the waitress's attitude. The kids had a blast and my daughter said it was her best birthday ever. Thank you!","Large gambling spa resort. Many restaurants, poker room, meeting rooms, pools and 2 wings of hotel rooms. Nice views from almost every room. They also have a tub and shower in their standard rooms. Good light blockout curtains. Outdoor pool. . What makes this place extra fun is that you can walk out of the casino and go to an outdoor shopping mall with restaurants, retail and hobby stores. There is actually fun restaurants here and interesting retail stores from jewelry, clothes, to hiking wares. Most bars/restaurants feature gambling and great beer/alcohol features. . Can walk even farther to a Whole foods and pizza place. Lots of stuff.","We love Black Rock!!! This is THE best place to get pizza!! We became fans when they were over on Race St. Now that they have more room it's even better!!! They also have live music, real pinball tables, and support local charities. My kind of place!!!!!","Trying out a new Greek place today and so happy I did! Went to Hummus for lunch. This is a great concept I like. Blaze pizza did it and so does Hummus. A Chipotle style built your own bowl or wrap. Lots of great options! I went with the bowl today and I loved it! Delicious and the healthiest thing I've had in days, just a real feel good meal. I thought having hummus on the bottom would be weird, but I worked great. The lamb was wonderful and I love the whole scoop of feta. Will definitely be back especially since it's so close to my place in Anthem.","Pizza was pretty authentic, I am a New Yorker so always looking for good pizza. Also, tried the cannoli and it was awesome.","This place had us pretty impatient the whole time! I shared a pizza with my significant other and he asked for half of it to have no onions but it came out covered in onions all over! It then took a half an hour to split the bill. To be honest i wasn't very impressed by the food.","Called in and was put on hold for more than 5 minutes. Once I placed my order I was told pickup would be between 6:30 and 6:50. . . . it's 4:30! 2 hours for a couple of thin crust pizzas? Why a twenty minute range for pickup? I cancelled order so never got to taste the food. Good news is that the reviews are bad, so it'll slow down enough for me to give it a try very soon. . FYI - your rating on Yelp is the same as Peter Piper Pizza. Hilarious!","If you like thin greasy pizza, then Alexander's Pizza is good for you. The $6 large pizza is a nice deal, and I do admit the flavor is marginally better than Caesar's $5 pizza. The only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking WET from being drenched in oil. . Alexander's pizza also serves Italian and Greek entree meals. The pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! It's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads. Their ranch dressing really is superb and the family that runs this place seem very nice. Not the friendliest bunch of people, but you can tell their honest and work hard.","I don't know what people are talking about. Being from NJ I can tell you this is NOT good NY style pizza. It's the kind of pizza you get in NY and then never return to that place again. I tried the regular and the white pizza. The white pie had no flavor, no garlic no salt, nothing. The regular pie had hardly any sauce, and the crust was hard as a rock. I hope there are better places for \"NY style\" pizza in the area. We left hungry. They also messed up our order so it took about twenty minutes to get four slices of pizza warmed up. . Also they weren't wearing gloves or anything. Maybe I'm a stickler but I don't like people touching my food with their hands and then touching everything else in the kitchen. Gross.","This is THE BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER EATEN !!!!  Amazingly fast, friendly delivery of the most amazing pizza EVER !!!  There is no other pizza joint for me. Ahwatukee rocks!!!","A lazy Sunday precluded me from making dinner so Pizza Pit Extreme was the next best option. The take-out spot (there are a few tables if you wanted to eat onsite) is a strange one. It is an amalgamation of three former separate restaurants-Pizza Pit, Pizza Extreme and Athen's gryo. This makes it a bit challenging ordering online as there are options for that refer to either Pizza Pit or Pizza Extreme but no explanation on what makes them different (case in point, what is Pizza Pit sauce vs Extreme sauce?). . The menu is pretty extensive (always a concern for me) so I stuck to a pepperoni and sausage pizza. With a coupon, the price was right for what we got. The toppings were pretty standard and not much different that ones found on a store bought pizza. It was definitely greasy. . In a pinch or on a hungover day, I would come back due to how close by it is for me. I wouldn't, however, hold it as a gold or even silver standard for what a pizza should be.","I am so glad that I didn't find this place as soon as we got to town because I am afraid that I wouldn't have eaten anywhere else. The day we found it we went for lunch and then back for dinner. The pizza and pepperoni rolls were both fresh and hot. The staff was friendly and helpful. We were there on a Sunday during a Steelers game, but the service was still plenty fast. If you are looking for a great meal with fresh, homemade ingredients then this is your place.","Haven't been to pizza hut in a few yrs. My daughter and I wanted to try the bacon crust pizza one day a few wks ago so I ordered online  (ok that wasn't successful so I had to call) anyway I placed my order and 5 mins later they called and said they ran out of the bacon crust. This was at noon. Wasn't very happy. Needless to say I don't think I'll be attempting this again any time soon","I wasn't planning on commenting on quality of food, but since other's have been experiencing the same issues. . . . We were very excited to move into Sun Prairie where there was a Glass Nickel Pizza nearby (we previously lived in the Milwaukee area). The day after we moved in, we decided to order Glass Nickel to eat while unpacking. The staff was fairly friendly on the phone, pizza came in the delivery estimate time. Pizza itself was okay, but not NEARLY as good as the New Berlin and West Madison locations. . The next day, we became violently ill. With the chaos of moving, their pizza was the only thing I ate all day so I'm sure that it was from this. My husband and I are positive we got food poisoning from their pizza. We do not plan on re-visiting the Sun Prairie Glass Nickel Pizza (especially after the reviewer stated that employees were cleaning toilets sans washing hands). Such a shame!!","We have ordered and enjoyed: buffalo chicken salad, steak salad, Caesar salad, tossed salad with cheese, spinach rolls, eggplant parmesan hoagie, the Napoleon pizza, and pizza with and without toppings. As others have mentioned, the cheesey breadsticks are great. I'm vegetarian and I love their eggplant parm, especially on the Napoleon pizza. . We get delivery in Fineview in 45 minutes or less. I've ordered online, through Eat24 and GrubHub. I prefer Eat24 and their weekly $2 coupon, as well as their Pizza &amp; Sticks deal for $16. 99 (large cheese pizza, breadsticks &amp; mozzarella sticks [toppings extra]. ). I believe the horrible driver people have mentioned no longer works there. We've been ordering delivery on monthly basis from Riviera Pizza for over two years and have had a problem only once.","A co-worker had Recommended Nick's to me. So about a week before the flood, I found myself in Calgary and decided to check out Nicks. . The restaurant itself is large inside. We chose to be seated in the bar section so we could watch the hockey game. No problems there. . We both ordered pizza. I had the \"Nick\" special - ordering the smallest of the three sizes (10 inches). When it arrived it had about 6 full sized slices. The crust was decent - much better than chain pizza crust. There were a lot of tasty toppings, and I was full on about 4 slices. My pedometer said I was at 12, 000 steps for the day with about another 3, 000 to get back to the hotel so I downed the next two slices.  . We also ordered ice cream for dessert. Its not on the menu as an option but our waitress was more than willing to make it available. . Overall, I would definitely repeat my next time in Calgary.","Great pizza, great price! . Always walk in here for a slice and a pop when I'm in the Durham region for work. Service is good and quick. Pizza is delicious. They seem to doing a good business as a lot of people walk in to pick up their pizzas. Price is very good, cheaper than most places.","Located in the basement of Organic Marketplace on New Hope Road, the staff makes fresh soups and hummus daily. Also homemade salad dressings on thier raw food and salad bar. They make healthy wraps and pizzas and have a great selection of smoothies.","Not bad for a chain. I think with Il Piazzaiolo and Mercurio's there's really no competition, but for a quick bite in Settlers Ridge, it was a-okay!. I ordered the roasted cauliflower pizza. The cauli was roasted to a crisp and I really liked the Parmesan cheese on top. An individual size pizza was plenty for a lunch portion too. . I also ordered a Bloody Mary since it was on special (I can't help myself). It wasn't horrible, but kinda boring. . The service was incredibly friendly. I just wish they weren't blasting the AC, as I was felt like I needed a parka to eat inside in August. I'll take my pizza parka free, thanks!","Ordered the gluten free pesto party pizza. It was so delicious I ate the whole pizza save for one slice I gave to a co-worker. They lose a star because I felt nickel and dimed for everything. I ordered my pizza carry out and got charged for one ranch and hot peppers, and I almost got charged for a water cup because I wanted one with a lid but the guy behind the register was nice enough to just give it to me. So after the gluten free crust (which I expect to pay extra for) and the little condiments, and tip I spent $18 on a personal pizza. A little on the pricey side for lunch.","The food was delicious but I had to take it home since we ordered calamari and salad and pizza to go and i had to have spaghetti. I'd recommend this place to everyone. Ebony was an awesome waitress. She was very nice and checked up on us if we needed anything.","My wife and I are pizza snobs. We've tried A LOT of pizza places in the 10 years we've lived here and NO ONE compares to Rino D's. They are just that good.  . We love the white pizzas and the chicken pesto. They have good appetizers and the deserts are good. The calzones are pretty good too, just a touch greasy. We always order delivery. They get here pretty fast (of course we live just a couple blocks away).  . I love all the coupons they have and their rewards program is awesome. I've never received so many free pizzas anywhere in my life. Their delivery drivers are very nice, friendly and polite. I highly recommend them. But taste around first if you must. You won't be disappointed.","Still yucky.  picked up an order which should have been hot, hard as a rock like cardboard and burnt on the bottom. There are many other places in town for good pizza avoid this and you will be more than happy. Hit and Miss place, mostly Miss","Fantastic restaurant to go to for a classy romantic or family oriented dinner. The food itself is based around the concept of everything local everything fresh. I ordered the polenta fries, which are to die for, and a pizza, which was very authentic in terms of the way it was prepared. The service is phenomenal and the owner was very friendly. If you get a chance to go to this place don't hesitate.","This pizza was great. Pizza sauce makes a good pizza and this was outstanding. Great service. Loved the \"chandelier\". Great experience.","Okay. . . another check in. There is no doubt this is one of my \"go to\" places to eat and I will continue to go back! On this visit I asked for a giant slice with extra sauce on top! In my previous reviews I already noted that the pizza is excellent! Awesome crust, awesome cheese, and an amazing sauce. Also worthy of noting that they are consistent. . . it's always awesome!. I know it's weird. Lol I thought of asking for extra sauce on top because there is a place in Brooklyn I used to go to all the time called L &amp; B Spumoni Gardens. I know extra sauce is a boring for a pizza topping but let me tell you it was delicious!!!!!! Mmmmm!! Mmmm!! Even this photo makes my mouth water!","I happened upon this place and because it was so close to home I decided to try it. The pizza was very good, the wings came with sauce on the side which I thought was odd. They didn't seem too busy when I went to pick it up, almost like they were waiting for me to come so they could leave, it was ready pretty quick too, like 15 minutes or so (they said they discontinued delivery by 8:30, it was 8:35 or so when I called--- not a big deal I totally get it)  None of this bothered me again food was great. When I had called again on a Friday night there was no answer, it was 7:45pm or so, I tried calling multiple times. Finally I went there and they we're closed! At 8pm on a Friday night! Stools up and everything. That was disappointing, I will try them again, hopefully I catch them before they bounce.","Pizza came out cold. We ordered the classic pepperoni and there were probably three slices of pepperoni in the entire pizza. It was just all sauce and cheese.","By far my favorite pizza in town! The deep dish is to die for and so is their service! I have eaten here countless times and have never been let down!","The 3030 has quickly become my go to destination in the Junction (Serious hat tip to Hole in the Wall, that place is excellent too). The first thing you will notice when you enter the 3030 is that there is SPACE. This isn't your typical sardine-packed Dundas bar and you are not going to have to grind through a sea of people to get a drink. Sorry annonymous gropers, it's back to Red Light for you. You may have to wait to get a table but there is ample room in the back, and a second bar, so you don't need to lurk over peoples tables while they eat. Better still, pump some quarters in to the pinball machines while you wait. . They few shows I have seen the acoustics have been OK. It's a large concrete box so you have to work with what you got, and they do a decent job. You will see the sound guy moving about the room checking levels. Gotta appreciate the effort. . Pretty well rounded beer selection and the few small dishes I have ordered were pretty tasty, arrived promptly to the correct table (WHAAAAT), and were well priced. Most notable were the double w/ pork belly &amp; Blue Mac &amp; Cheese. I've read alot of complaints about the service, and personally can't speak to that. My experiences have always been pleasant. Sadly, It's not your servers fault it's January outside. . If the menu doesn't tickle your fancy there's a pizzeria down the road called Little Caesers that does a pretzel crust pizza. :-o. The future is NOW.","Came for a weekend skate with my girlfriend and her little sister. Employees were all very nice, and courteous. Interior design was a bit lacking, as building is pretty dated and little to no effort was made to cover up the cinderblock construction. Seemed very 80s or 90s but not really in a good way. Food prices were good, but food itself was lackluster. I wanted a slice of pizza that was advertised on the menu and was told slices were not available and I'd have to buy a whole pizza that would take about 30 minutes to bake. Settled for a hot dog and watched as the stale bun crumbled apart after the first bite, but I guess I shouldn't expect a whole lot when it was $2.","I stayed here for 5 days so here's the breakdown. . . PROS:. I got a 600 sq ft. suite on the 32nd floor with a fat ass balcony, strip view,  2 42\" plasmas, TV in the bathroom, bomb ass shower with a rain nozzle on the ceiling, jacuzzi tub with jets and speakers, fridge, and one helluva comfortable ass bed. . This was easily the nicest room with best view of the strip I have ever been in. You can see the whole strip because this hotel is on the other side of the 15. From Mandalay Bay all the way down to the Stratosphere, you can see everything. . Paid 120 a night for this place. This room is easily worth 3 times that. . Staff was on point with luggage and valet. . 24 hour room service. . Ipod dock with speakers. . Bunch of kitchen utensils, stove, stocked mini fridge (don't even think about pulling anything out of there I can only imagine a jack daniels shooter is like 12 bucks). Button you can flip on permanently that lights up the do no disturb sign outside your room. . Safe and 2 closets. . Comfortable couch. . Free USA today paper. . Self parking was literally a 100 foot walk to my car every time. . Did I mention it came out to 120 a night? . All in all I was real happy with the whole experience. . CONS:. At check in I found out I needed to have a 500 dollar authorization put a credit card (100 for each night). I wasn't told this at anytime by palms or the site I booked through. The front desk guy did it for 300 cash but that was money I planned on spending on coke and hookers. . No phone book in the room (personal pet peeve). No ice machine on each floor (brought to you by room service one tiny ass bucket at a time. . Internet costs 13 bucks a day. . Long distance phone calls cost (get this) 5. 00 for the first minute, 79 cents for each additional. (I found this out after I made 2 calls). Fridge could have been bigger. . Room service costs an absolute fortune and there was some crazy 10 dollar mark up on my bill so with tip, 2 small pizzas cost me like 50 bucks. . Early check out? Doesn't exist on a Friday. . 200 dollar charge if you smoke in the room. . 300 dollar charge if you don't check out on time. . Check out is 11am (brutal when you were at the strip club till 3:30 am). All in all I was amazed with the room and the view. Might be the nicest place I ever stay at but the list of cons brought it down a star for me. . The website you want to check for the best deals is www. tripres. com.","Pizza, pizza, pizza. Love it. Nello's is a good laid back place to get together with some family and/or friends and have lots of options for pizza and sald, and knock a few back. Service is about 4 stars too.","Had lunch with my wife here. She's Colombian and felt it had some traditional Colombian flavors with more modern simple dishes. I mention the Colombian part as there are really no restaurants close by with rice, beans, sweet plantains, empanadas, and steak. Was very good quick and attentive service. For $5. 99 she got the dinner portion with soup. I tried the grilled chicken over salad with avocados beans and corn was delicious and will definitely go here again. One of the reviews picked up food for take out and I understand his feelings as haven eaten many Colombian meals prepared by her Mom, her aunts, many places in Florida, Puerto Rico and in Dominican Republic this food is just best eaten right away. Try it out, for the area it's great to have another option other than BBQ, Chinese, or pizza.","Came here on the 29th of March for the Lucky Gnocchi Night, which is basically all-you-can eat gnocchi in a variety of sauces. . There are specific seating times for this event - not sure of all of the times, but the dinnertime options were 5 or 7 p. m. . The gnocchi overall was decent, it was kind of hit or miss with some batches overcooked, or too cold, or just right. Our faves of the night were the bolognese, four cheese, and Pompeii (basic, crushed tomato sauce). The pesto one was quite good as well, but the butter sage was flavourless. Service was frequent, but they ran out of some flavours and returned with second rounds of previous flavours instead which I was kind of disappointed in. . I probably won't return for the gnocchi event now that I've tried it, but may go back to try out their pizzas and other dishes.","3. 5 stars. Good pizza and decent beer list! . Their pizza are really big and a medium size pizza is definitely enough for two people with still some leftover to spare. They do not skimp on the toppings and the crust tastes great. I would definitely visit again!","I came here for lunch sometime when I krave for some good pizza. . . . The price is fantastic and the pizza is pretty good. . . . It's not on top of my list but it serves its purpose for a quick lunch. . . . People are mostly buy it togo. . . there are limited table to dine in. . . . It made to QG approved list only if i'm around the area. . . not really driving across town just for it!","Peter Piper is Arizona's family oriented pizza chain. Most people think the pizza is complete garbage and often describe it as cardboard, but I think it's just plain great.","I gave this place a second chance and the service was much better and the food was pretty dang good. Had a personal chicken artichoke pizza. I would get it again. Must have been there on an off night at first.","I used to work as a waitress at this restaurant's original incarnation (Amelio's est. 1985) in 2003 when I was at university so I can you that not only is the food DELICIOUS, this is a lovely family restaurant that treats its staff very well. . I thought they'd closed down so I was ecstatic when my boyfriend found out they reopened as Amelia's with the daughter at the helm, how wonderful to see this awesome family business continue past its 30th year! I love supporting local companies and this is the real deal. . Now on to the food! There's a reason that every crop of McGill students learns of Amelia's and quickly sees it as a staple. Not only are the prices reasonable, it's BYO and group-friendly for before a big night out. It was not uncommon when I worked there for groups of 8 to show up with a couple of boxes of wine and have a great time before hitting the night life. Now I happen to prefer a better quality to drink myself, but love that this joint is casual enough to cater to that crowd and nice enough to suit my needs as a young professional as well. . The white pizza (5-cheese) is a MUST. I highly recommend sharing one small, medium or large with your table as it's a little intense to eat alone but absolutely TO DIE FOR. You must try it as nature intended, but a great hack from my waitressing days is to ask them to add tomato slices &amp; garlic for even more flavour. Just adding mushrooms is another fav. . The Florentine pizza with artichoke hearts and spinach is also amazing, and often gets overshadowed by the white but very subtle and delicious flavors. Only available as a small, so bear that in mind! The vegetarian is delicious and has a sauce base that includes eggplant. The Reuben pizza is basically a smoked meat sandwich in a pizza, complete with sauerkraut and mustard on the side - definitely not for the faint of heart but we'll worth it if you love meat and want the adventure. If you're a first-timer I'd definitely suggest splitting that with a more standard pizza,  though. Or the White :). You really can't go wrong with the pizzas, and any small can be done in whole wheat dough which is great if you wanna be a bit healthier. They aren't intended to be Italian-style thin crust pizzas so do be aware of that. The crust is fluffy, buttery, almost pastry-like (I believe they use Crisco shortening in the dough) so expect more of a New York style slice. I almost never eat crusts from pizzas but I always finish theirs, they're so good!! . The little salads that come with each order are lovely and give you that valuable extra greenery before say, eating 5 melted cheese on dough!! And their subs and pastas are great too, but the pizzas really do shine here. . If you get dessert, the cheesecake was always my favourite, and all desserts are made in-house. . Note that it's cash only, so come prepared! One of my fav things to do is get dinner here before catching a rep film at Cinema Du Parc. They stop taking customers at 9 (but you can be seated until 9 and stay until 10) so plan accordingly. . You will have an awesome meal, promise :)","My boyfriend and I came in here for the first time for dinner. I had Lasagna and my boyfriend had the waiter by the name of Jared build him a pizza it was very good and we had chicken wings. The restaurant was very clean but it felt a little warm in here. I would recommend this place to my friends. We will be back to try their chicken.","Good food in a great location inside the linq promenade. Stumbled upon this place after walking all evening and was pleasantly surprised. Great pizzas, amazing service. What more can you ask for?","Pop Up Pizza was conveniently located next to the elevator going to my room, so of course I had to try it. If you're staying at Plaza, look out for their coupon too! My welcome booklet came with a deal on two slices of cheese and a drink, but I just asked if I could pay a little extra for toppings. . The storefront is cool looking and they were playing a lot of dubstep. . . probably because it was EDC week. The workers there were friendly, and even though there is no soda fountain outside, you can still get free refills of your drink by asking. . I got a slice of their White Chapel pizza (ricotta and spinach) as well as a generic meat lovers. The White Chapel is sooo goooood! The other one was tasty too, but I preferred the White Chapel despite the lack of meat. The slices are pretty big, and I really liked the crisp yet chewy crust. Dare I say I liked it better than Secret Pizza, a Vegas joint on the strip that also has NY style pizza? What they have on this place is location, but Pop Up Pizza is cheaper, faster, and equally (if not more) delicious. . Food: 4, Service: 4, Environment: 4, Price: 3","This pizza has a good amount of sauce, and it is very flavorful, giving it a homemade feeling. The crust is delicious, too. We mostly order the pizza and cheese bread. I'm not crazy about this style of garlic bread they make, as it hardens quickly, but their cheese bread is phenomenal and somehow tastes even better as leftovers.","Sadly, as I am a huge Arcadia Nook fan, I cannot give this location the 5 star rating I was totally expecting to give. I am in love with the Wood Fired Olives appetizer here, we ordered that and it was totally on par with the Arcadia location. My family ordered two pizza's the Giardino and the Margherita and said it was also on par with Arcadia and they looked great.    . My order was the Cowboy Rib Eye. I typically bounce back and forth between the Chicken Marsala and the Filet, and I tell everyone the Filet at Nook Arcadia is the best $27 filet you will ever eat. They don't offer the Filet here so I went with their new Ribeye which is $34 and served over smashed Yukon Gold potatoes with four asparagus spears on the side.  . Presentation and plating was beautiful. . . My mouth was watering. . . The ribeye was bone-in BUT it was full of fat and gristle, it was edible but I spent most of the time trying to cut around the gristle or pulling it out of my mouth. I don't mind fat in my steak I just prefer more to steak to fat, and not the tough gristle this steak had throughout. The potatoes which were advertised as garlic parmesan were also bland and seem to be lack both garlic and parmesan. The asparagus was good. This is not anything like the preparation or quality of the Filet at Arcadia and it was a 2 star dish for me for sure on the steak quality alone. I typically want to lick my plate at Nook but this wasn't the case the plate left the table with half a steak, lots of fat pieces and almost all the potatoes.  . This location charges more for the same dishes, understandably they are in the hotel, it is bigger and they likely have more expenses, however I was a little surprised to see the same Chicken Marsala offered at Arcadia was $5 more here.  . The valet parking is also expensive, $17 normally, $12 if you eat at the restaurant and get a stamp. Find a parking spot if you can and don't valet, this isn't Nook's fault, just a tip. . If it weren't for the olives and pizza this would sadly be a 2 star review for me. Service was good.","Went in on Memorial Day, no complaints! Quick service, good selection. Right next to it is a brewery with beer &amp; wine selections that you can eat at too. I had the pizza special (ratatouilli sp?) &amp; added a fried egg !","The food is excellent and the bread is the best in Urbana. Dinner is delightful with excellent gourmet pizzas, fondu, tapas, etc. On Sunday, they have an excellent and low priced brunch. The dinner prices are reasonable for the quality of the food. Their sangria is also the best I've ever tasted. The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is the service which at times is very slow.","I wonder if Hannibal Lecter eats here?. Lamb brains, anyone?. Sensing my curiosity, the charming waiter talked me into it by saying that it was \"just a tiny bite\". . Well, a tiny bite it wasn't. In fact, two egg-roll sized, bacon-wrapped \"lamb brains\" showed up, with a side of (I think) pesto sauce.  . It tasted like. . . monk fish liver.  . If you don't think about what you're eating. . . it's not off-putting at all. I'm glad I tried it. . . and it's now at the top of the \"the weirdest things I've eaten\" list, replacing kangaroo meat pizza (those Australians weren't kidding). . Anyway - aside from that, I'd highly recommend the pig ears - a bit addicting, though too salty for my taste. . I'd skip the pig blood spaghetti - chewy, but no sense in paying $22 for pure shock value in food. . As for wine, if you like full bodied reds without tannins, try the 2011 Montalbera Ruch\u00e8 di Castagnole Monferrato L'Accento. Smooth!","I really enjoyed this restaurant. In fact, I went there twice during my stay. Mostly for the pizza. I had a fig and artichoke pizza, and added chicken. It was so dang tasty! It was not overly sweet, as you might imagine. It had a perfect blend of tastes. I crave it all the time. The specialty cocktails were very expensive for drinks. My friends had a mango mohito, and said that they were awesome. The service was good. The atmosphere is great. It was very busy at all, which I couldn't understand, but it was overall a great experience. Highly recommended for a reasonably priced, nice meal (reasonably prices for Vegas, that is).","Glad to hear that this location is just steps from the office and is perfect when wanting to catch up with coworkers after a long hard day. . Their second location being relatively new, is a great addition to the financial district. Serving up some great craft and seasonal beers it's perfect for those beer experts who truly appreciate locally brewed draft.  . Their menu is full of popular pub fares that have no shortage of small portions.  . The ambiance can get loud depending if you're upstairs or downstairs and at what time of the day.  . Though I am more of a wine drinker I did give their Blonde and Amber beer a try which was crispy, light and refreshing. . In terms of food our small group tried their Flammekueches (hard to pronounce) which was a flatbread pizza served with cheese, black olives, cheese and ham. This definitely complimented our beers, however the next time I'll be sure to try some of their pub grubs to get a better sense of the menu. . Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Cleanliness 4/5","First time tonight. Staff super friendly, service great, and pizza was fantastic!  We've found a new hangout!  Can't wait to try something else for dinner.","From time to time, my family enjoys a good pizza. However, the gluten free options are very limited for my youngest son and myself. We have ordered from Dominos, which is really gross. . Streets of New York was introduced to us about a year ago. We have been back several times when we want to have a pizza treat. We love the food.  . The only issue we have is the wait is often very long for our food and the wait staff seems is always a little on the blah side. A smile, every once in awhile would be nice.  . We will continue to come back, but I would recommend the wait staff perk up a bit, often you look like you (all) hate being there.","Did the online order. Arrive at the time that the food was supposed to be ready. 10 minutes after I'm told it will be a little longer, I'm told that the wings are going to be another 12 minutes!!!  WTF?!? So now I'm sitting here in the store for about 30 additional minutes!  I wouldn't have ordered if I knew it was gonna be this long for one pizza and a few wings. Nobody wants to sit in your shack for 30 minutes when you've already been told that the food will be ready when you arrive. the question I have now is how cold is the pizza gonna be when I get home. I want a nice fresh, hot pizza. Not something that's been sitting for 30 f-ing minutes!!!","We ordered takeout tonight and absolutely loved it. We had a couple of deep dish pizzas, a gluten free pizza, a salad, some wings, and the cheese curds. Everything was delicious!  Also, the service picking up the food was excellent. Everyone was very friendly and the food was ready on time.","By The Slice is one of the best pizza places I been to. It is a small place nicely tucked away in the plaza. I order here at least once a month for lunch with my co-workers. They always have killer deals such as 2 medium speciality pizza for $16. 99 - Their specialy pizzas are amazing as they have around 5-6 toppings on it. Southwest chicken and Meat combo are my fave. If you just want to pick your own toppings there is a 2 Medium pizza 6 toppings combined from $14. 99. Ex-Large Margherita or 4 cheese pizza for $9. 99. They surpising also have amazing fried chicken almost like KFC.  I actually like it more than KFC and it is cheaper as well.  10 huge Chicken pieces and medium wedges for only $12. 99. Only thing bad is the plaza parking is horrible as it shared with Wendy's, starbucks, Kelsey and Mr. Greek. Can't wait to order from them this Friday.","Went to Blue Hound a couple of nights ago for the first time with friends. The hotel and restaurant had a cool and hip atmosphere. We were seated promptly at our reservation time and the place was not crowded. Our server was pleasant and knowledgeable and recommended several things on the menu including the special which was soft shell crab over an artichoke coulis with fiddlehead fern. I ordered the special (and a shot of gazpacho) and the others at the table ordered a flatbread pizza and tater tots (yum!), the salmon, and the chicken. When the salmon came out, it was such a tiny portion and my friend commented on it. I had an option of ordering one or two crabs with my dinner and I opted for one after asking our server if it would be plenty of food. I should have ordered two. The food at Blue Hound is creative, ubber fresh, and delicious. However, we all left still feeling hungry due to the small portion sizes. We talked about ordering more food but the items are quite pricey and our bill was already over $100 without tip (only two of us had an alcoholic drink). We eat out frequently at all of the new hip and trendy places that are opening all over Phoenix and feel that with all the other restaurants who are now offering creative farm to table food at  lower prices and larger (yet reasonably sized) portions, Blue Hound has some adjusting to do. It would be a tough sell to get me to go back unless I knew our bellies would be full and our bill not so high.","I absolutely love this place. I moved to the Peoria area about 7 months now and I was trying to find that one really good local pizza joint and I finally found it a few months ago! This place has such a unique place, you can have the exact pizza you love and as fresh as possible because it's baked in your own oven. They use fresh ingredients, awesome sauce and it's pretty affordable ply they have this stamp card so after so many purchases you can get a free family size! I highly recommend this place for any family looking for some good fresh pizza that won't break the bank in the process","It's pretty difficult to find good pizza in Las Vegas. It's even more difficult to please 2 east coast people that know their pizza. So when my husband and I say that this is good stuff, we really mean it. . We love the to-go window where you can order by the slice and even an entire pie. Let's be honest, it's the perfect stop after a night of drinking.","Yuummmmm!!! We went here to eat after the high roller and got the garlic cheese bread appetizer and classic pepperoni pizza. . . our first time there, all the food was amazing!  We sat on the patio and when it started raining the waiters came over immediately and helped us move everything to a covered table. Definitely going there for pizza next time we make a Vegas trip.","I really enjoyed this place on my recent visit to the Aria Casino. It's located near the sports book, which was a plus for me. The pizza was great and they had a nice selection of local craft beer, which was nice since I was visiting from out of town. . 5 Stars all the way!","Because everyone has to come here once for their roast duck poutine pizza. . Unfortunately, the pizza was just alright. Sure we all love a thin crust pizza with cheese curds falling off, but the combination of everything comprising the topping was a little overwhelming. I ended up eating the fries separately for the slices that I had, and I barely tasted the duck pieces because of how many other ingredients were on the pizza. It's like one of those school projects where the idea is nice, execution could even be effortless, but final result, underwhelming. . Miheer's Curried Lamb Shoulder- Didn't see the curry in the description and expected a chunk of lamb shoulder. . what a flavourful dish though!  It was a very creamy curry with a hint of spice, the lamb was well-cooked and I LOVED the garlic roti that the curry came with. It was a bit oily but I loved how chewy the roti was and balanced the curry nicely. Almost wished we didn't have the pizza to start so that I could enjoy more of this dish, definitely a fan. . Service was good, decor is worth a look. . O&amp;B does it well :)","We live in the neighbourhood and decided to go for an early dinner with our two young daughters. We arrived at around 5:30 on a Saturday and there was plenty of space - the tables were filling up when we were leaving though. I love, love, love that it is very kid friendly while still having amazing grown up food. They have a kids menu, crayons and a little play area in the corner with some toys and a chalkboard wall. My girls both had the kids salami pizza and my only complaint would be that the salami was too spicy - we picked it off and they ate their cheese pizza happily. My husband and I both had pizzas and they were very good - thin crispy crust and large portions. Our waiter was very friendly and the food arrived hot and quickly. We will definitely be back - maybe for a date night without the kids next time.","Amazing pizza for $10 and half price apps between 4-6 weekdays. Can't recommend this place enough. All pizza recipes that we've tried are perfectly balanced and full of high quality ingredients.","The best thing about our visit was our waitress. She was attentive and apologetic that the pizza was terrible. It was undercooked, the crust was soggy and the toppings were sparse. Too bad. It was the first time we have been out in the evening in 4 months. What a disappointment!  We won't be returning.","Everything was fantastic and we had taru sake and foods which is that rice pizza and takowasa. . Also, I got hamaguri, black cod , octopus and kimchee sunomono which was cool, salmon carpaccio, some kind of skewer and so on. . We ordered a lot and it's hard to remember what we got but in fact it was amazing goodness. . Miyuki and Alex were awesome. They was really attentive and helpful. . We'll definitely come back ! . Here is a good Japanese restaurant in las vegas. I've been in many Japanese spot which is so famous in this town and Here is so good :) try !","We found this place by doing a search on Yelp. We ordered a Sal's special pizza and an order of bread with cheese. The food and service was great. The price was great for what we received. We will be back when we are in the area.  . This place has a lot going for it. The atmosphere inside is nice and it is like stepping away from the busy area just outside its doors. It was clean and comfortable and very relaxing. The service was great and our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu.","Flour &amp; Barley is located on the LINQ Promenade. This place has really good wood fire pizzas. You can buy the pizza by the slice at the stand right next to the restaurant. If you want to try their specialty pizzas, you will have to order from the restaurant. . Each pizza is about 11 inches, and the crust is really thin. I recommend people to get their own pizzas instead of sharing. I got to try the mushroom pizza and it was one of my favorites. There was a decent amount of mushrooms. I also tried the Big Apple pizza, which is just spicy pepperoni. This was also tasty. . Overall, great place to get pizzas. The staff is very nice and friendly to their customers. I would definitely come back!","OMG. The best pasta everrrr ! I always make sure I stop by here on my travels to Charlotte. You choose what you want to put in it and they make the pasts right in front of you. They also have a pizza selection that they make in front of you too for the pizza lovers. The atmosphere is pleasant and very cute for dates !","Awsome little Italian place. Never would have expected such delicious food from first appearance. The Calamari was cooked perfectly. The Caprese salad was spot-on as was the cheese pizza and cioppino were excellent. They are pet and military friendly.","We \"used\" to order the family special every week or two on a regular basis. Food was decent &amp; value for the $ (at that time) was fairly good too. One night we ordered, the food was delivered. We paid cash &amp; tipped well (always do, as I used to deliver fast food myself). We get a telephone call the next day saying that we shorted the driver $10. WTF? Seriously? Like the driver would NOT know this right at the door (if it were true)? We do NOT get a call that night (we ordered for dinnertime) but the next day! Clearly they got ripped off by their driver. We have NOT ever ordered from there again. Brampton's best pizza(s). . Mackay &amp; Gusto's.","I was excited to try a new pizza place so close to my house. I should have saved my money. Person on the phone and at the shop was very nice, so it's doubly disappointing to give them a bad review. . Bottom line, our pizza was over-cooked. We could tell when we opened the box. The crust was dark brown, as was the cheese. On one pizza the bottom of the crust was burned black and we could not eat it. The other was not as burned, but was so overcooked it was not enjoyable.  . Whoever cooked this pizza should have known the second it came out of the oven that it was ruined. I would have preferred them being honest and asking me to wait an extra 10 minutes to make another instead of passing off something they had screwed up. Sure they saved a little money that night, but they lost the lifetime value of me as a customer. That hundreds of dollars lost as well as me not telling people to avoid going there. . It such a hassle to get home to discover the problem. Do I call and complain? Do I have them make another requiring another trip and eating at 9:00 PM? . We also ordered 6 buffalo wings which were good. Good meat and tangy sauce. . Finally, I was also disappointed in the quantity of pizza toppings. I ordered pepperoni and mushroom and there was maybe one mushroom per slice, some had none. . I really wanted to like this place, especially because I like thin crust pizza, but we are one and done. We won't be going back.","I love the idea and execution of custom made pizzas. The pizza was delicious and it was ready in less than 5 minutes. I am a fan of this place and will be back. The place is cool and happy.","We ordered pizza. It was pretty tasty. But the service was very slow. For the prices, I expect a refill of a soft drink without being asked (and I wasn't asked until just before the check arrived). In the end, I felt it was a little overpriced for what we got. Maybe that's how everything is downtown, but I could take it or leave.","Beef carpacio is good, pizza is fresh. Good, over priced Italian food at best. However, great patio for drinks located on a surprisingly quiet street.","We love their margarita pizza!  Their delivery service is always fast and their food is amazing. Highly recommend!","Terrible, terrible, terrible. Let me say first that we didn't get the deep dish, I didn't realize that is what they were famous for. Also the staff were nice, not overly helpful but never rude. My daughter got their wings, super fatty (probably Tyson). There was a long blonde hair in it, she has dark brown hair. When we told our waiter he said OK then took the plate, no apology. They did bring her out new ones but like I said before they were to fatty to enjoy. They did not even offer to take them off our bill. Our thin crust pizza taste like it literally came from a box. I can't even remember the last time I have had thin pizza this BAD!! The ice cream cookie had generic tasting ice cream and I believe it was covered in the store bought Hershey's syrup. I have never written a bad review about a restaurant, only good ones. Nothing has ever been that disappointing that I felt the need to write one until now.","Decided to eat here again because I was craving the cheesy deliciousness and received a coupon in the mail for $10 off a $30 order. . Placed a to-go order. The pizza was ready by the time I got there and was a great price with the coupon. The pizza is AMAZING! I can't stop eating it. Because of the thickness of the pizza, you can eat two slices and be full. Recommend sharing a large with 3 other people or saving it for leftovers. I think it tastes even better the next day after being warmed up in the microwave.","These people are below average intelligence . Try to rip you off . Argue with you about specials posted on the menu board in the store!. Had enough of them I do not have the time to teach basic common sense !. The special reads add any pizza for 9. 95. (Equal or lesser value ). I order a pepperoni and sausage and a specialty pizza. . Simple right well they say they can't honor the \"2nd\" pizza because it's a \"specialty\". What does it matter what order I say my pizza's in?. Is it the darn important that you have to say the specialty pizza 1st? Common sense would be to just charge for the specialty pizza the charge me for the pepperoni and sausage at 9. 95 right?. Well if I have to teach them basic common sense and argue over it I will just find me a new shop!","I've had bad experiences at other Pizza Hut shops, but this one always gives me well made pizzas. Pizza is always fresh, never burnt, always done by the time I get there. There's always people in there so I'm assuming they feel the same way. Try the stuffed crust and crust toppers.","So walking in it was a little confusing if this was a order first type place or a sit down restaurant with someone waiting on you. We were the o my ones in the restaurant so that's not a good sign, but this place is right next to ASU and school is out. The menu was pretty basic and nothing really stood out to me but i ordered the REVO pizza. I do have to say I like way this place looks. It's very urban with giant glass windows and a great center bar with four flat screen TVs. . The pizza was good but wasn't amazing and the Caesar salad was very basic. I wouldn't mind go back and giving it one more try for dinner but I will be trying something else.","This hip pizza and beer spot has a live DJ at the bar. Pizzas are light and delicious. Staff is fantastic. Be sure to ask for the free hot peppers olive oil mix. . . Mmm!  Place was so great we went here twice on our 4-day vacation to Montreal.","We found this place from the awesome Yelp! Reviews. It did not disappoint!! From my husband's fried mozzarella to my gluten free spinach artichoke dip, then on to the fabulous gluten free pizza, we left stuffed. We were celebrating our honeymoon in the area and through conversation they found out and gave us an appetizer on the house! If we lived here this would be a go to spot for us! Thank you NYPD! You made us feel so special and full!","So all the Round Table Pizza chains in Vegas shut their doors and removed their signs. . . damn shame if you ask me as i was born and raised in the bay and Round Table has always been my favorite franchise of pizza. Damn. So after driving to their location on Sahara and Ft Apache with a craving for pizza just to find it closed i suggested hitting up Custom Built as it's been on my to do list for quite some time and we were set on pizza. . True to all their reviews and advertisement you pretty much build your own pizza from their selection of crusts and toppings. . I've been here twice back to back. First time i got a half and half of buffalo chicken and bbq chicken with a few add toppings and they turned out great. . Second time i tried to 'layer' the flavors by asking them to make rings of sauce on the crust before cheese and toppings are added. The result wasnt as i was expecting and i realized they dont put a lot of sauce because it makes the pie soggy. . I expect to be coming here frequently to try out the different combinations of pies.","The naan at this place is fantastic because it's perfect for dipping and absorbing sauces. My uneducated guess is that they remove many air bubbles before baking using a docker (a spiked roller often used on pizzas to remove air bubbles that would otherwise expand. Each piece of na'an is also thicker. We ordered a second helping of na'an for the 3 of us just to finish up the rest of our dishes. . The chicken jalfrezi was oily, but it was good and the chicken was tender. The butter chicken looked better. Choosing is very difficult because of the many options they have. . Next time we'll try the daily specials written on the chalkboard on the wall behind the register. Totally missed that. Service was unremarkable. . Wifi password is fishtikah","great newyork style pizza, crust and dough is really good. lunch with the slice and salad and drink is so bomb for like 4 bucks, maybe the cheapest lunch in town and it good, not just something you eat cause its cheap, you will want to go back again! wings are good and so are the fried mushroom and zucchini sticks.","Very mediocre pizza. If you're stranded in the Brothers parking lot with a broken down car and you're really hungry, you'd be better off walking to the Circle K and getting a snack to tide you over til help arrives. To everyone who gave it lots of stars, you need to get out more and live a little. . . and eat better pizza.","This place is kind of a hidden gem at The Venetian. I would never have thought to give this place a try had it not been for the thick \"Yellow Pages\" type book in the hotel room (where it was listed) and for Yelp. My friend and I came here around 5:30 on a Saturday and were, luckily, seated right away (I don't believe they take reservations). It is a small restaurant, but quaint. I love that the waiters spoke Italian; it made it more authentic to me. Also, our waiter was funny and really nice. . As for the food, it's yummy. The portions are big and you won't hurt your wallet eating here. Thank you to whoever suggested the meatballs. I think they are, by far, the best I've ever had. They were full of flavor and super moist. The garlic rolls were delicious as well. I was torn between the Penne in Vodka Sauce and Linguine Carbonara and the waiter suggested the latter. I am definitely glad he steered me that way because it was really good. If I had more room in my stomach I would've devoured the last three or four bites. My friend had the pepperoni pizza (I can't remember what it was listed under on the menu) and that was good as well (super big portions, it's like ordering a medium from Pizza Hut). The tiramisu was a perfect ending to the meal. I'd love to come here again and try their other dishes.","Great place to hang out with your friends. Although I was going to take another star off for the hefty price tag (around $45/p), the friendly staff made up for it. . When you enter, you will be required to fill a waiver on an ipad. Then you will be guided to a laneway with a staff member who goes over the rules with your group. Everyone then gets a few tries at throwing the axe. Bullseye is 5pts, inside the red is 3pts and blue is 1pt. . . etc. When the instructional time is over, your group will get to play against each other in a round robin game. Basically, the players with the highest points goes into finals. . Axe throwing may sound intimidating, but it gets much easier as you go. The staff is great in helping each person along the way. I also like how they let you bring outside food and beer. Our group was able to order pizza delivery while we were playing. Overall, you should try this if you have not tried this latest trend in summer activities! :D","Normally we love Papa John's, but they don't deliver to our place. We really wanted pizza so ordered carryout from what we thought was the Middleton store. Our mistake we ordered from here. That's ok. It was our mistake. . However, this store is insanely hard to find and get to and there is zero parking outside for carryout. We ordered online from another store and the order stated it would be ready in 45 minutes. It gave us a time. It actually took longer than 45 minutes to weave through the square and finally park illegally in an alley behind the store while the husband went to get said pizzas. They were just putting them in the oven. So we had to wait another twenty minutes and staff wasn't apologetic, just rude stating that the pick up time is an estimate. . The pizza was fine. It was fresh and stayed warm on an eighty degree day until we were home to eat it. But. . . . it's not worth the trip and while I gave no real issues with it taking an hour plus to be ready for carryout during a busy time of day  that should be acknowledged ahead of time.","The pizza here is pretty standard, nothing special but decent. I am a huge fan of the hot cookies though. That is what this review is for. I don't usually come to Oregano's unless I know I am getting a hot cookie for dessert. My favorite is the chocolate chip which comes with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. Best to share with a friend is it is rather large.","One of the best pizza places in Old Montreal. This place is packed during the weekend, so don't forget to make reservations in advance. The ambiance here is trendy. A fancy cast iron chandelier hangin, 80's music playing in the background, what's not to like about this place. We ordered the Arancino, Antipasti, Meatballs and pizza's. The Arancino's are delish. Deep fried risotto balls crispy on the top and soft inside, topped with meat sauce. Antipasti was ok. Meatballs were delicious too. Now for the pizza's. . . . . . . . Not one of  the best pizza's I've had, but they were good. We tried the Bosco in Bianco, Capriciosa &amp; Cotto E Bocconcini. The crust is flavorful. Woodfire makes these pizza's delicious, Though I prefer the crust to be a bit extra burnt. The Capriciosa was interesting as I'd never had a boiled egg on the pizza. It actually tastes really good. Also ask for the spicy oil. That adds a lot of flavor to it. . Definitely worth a visit . . . . . . Again &amp; again. . . . . . At least for the Arancino's  . . Food -  Good. Service - Friendly. Ambiance - Trendy. Worth the money - Aw yissss","I visited Famous Yeti's on the way home from a Badger game and I'm so glad I did!! What a neat place! The server was super friendly. The cheese bread and hand tossed pepperoni pizza was delicious. The restaurant itself was absolutely charming inside. It was decorated with reclaimed wood, vintage school chairs, and of course Yeti's. The owner even came out and said hello to us. I highly recommend this place. If you ever happen to be passing by, the 6 miles it sits off the highway goes by quickly! It's quite worth the trip.","Just flew into Phoenix after traveling over 24 hours - drove straight to our amazing rental house in chandler - found this Fantastic pizza place that delivers here on Yelp! Sweet lady with a name that began w A answered / very cheerful, accommodating &amp; polite. Our order arrived exactly when promised and delicious!!!!!!! Pizzas, salad &amp; all utensils, plates etc - highly recommend this place!!!!!!!!","Don't want to say too many things positive as I don't want it to get too crowded. Great pizza and salads. Very neighborly! Highly recommend.","If you have never been here, they will bring you a free sample of their wings. Great salad and great service. Highly recommend the eggplant pizza. The dough is made fresh! The salad pizza looks good, although I haven't tried it.","It's not the best pizza ever, not the best in the Strip. For the best pizza I would probably go to Grimaldi's at the venetian. But this is good, quality pizza. tasteful and quite convenient if you are at the Aria. . For a quick bite, it gets the job done. You won't be disappointed, especially if you are already inside the Aria. the slices are large and you can get your pizza and pay in about two minutes.","Good service, and $5 for a large NY style slice of pizza and beer is a pretty damn good deal. Note: that happy hour deal is only for 2 or 3 of the beers on draft.","Good food in a laid back atmosphere. If you're feeling lucky play some Keno. Also great pizza and beer specials on Tuesday's.","The most disgusting pizza I have ever eaten. Nothing but salt and no cheese. Ugh. . . will never order from them again!","Pretty average spot. . Italian food priced reasonably but won't really 'wow' you. I had a sausage pizza for 11$ which was a good size and cooked somewhere in between thin crust and doughy. They've got some lunch specials and salads that looked alright, although the salmon filet looked to be a frozen cut. . Service was adequate. . Is Baldwin street actually good?","Really a fun place. Great atmosphere, attentive and friendly servers and very good pizza and wings. . The only reason I would not give it a 5 star rating was that they were out of three of the beers I really wanted to try. . Definitely still a place I highly recommend.","Great pizza!! This place was a great last minute pick!! . We decided to bring in the big 2013 with a small get together celebration at this pizza joint!! The service was great!! We had a friendly and patient server with our undecided group. Also we loved the surprisingly good tasting white sauce on our pizzas!! Everything was amazing!! The Mozzarella appetizers and the Extreme Hot wings!! Oh so good, fatty food!! We look forward to coming back!!","YUMMMMM! . The atmosphere is so comfortable, I especially love the patio area where we like to enjoy a glass of wine and a couple of appetizers. The food is excellent especially the pizza and I think its hard to find good pizza!! This is a great place for date night or to bring the whole family. . . . . . we do both :). Great food at an excellent value with wonderful service! What more could you possibly want.","My husband and I love the Vig Deli. The French fries are delicious as well as their sandwiches and salads. We haven't had anything that isn't good there. The pizza is also delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone!  Just yummy!","We ordered this Monday night after a busy work day. Generally a fail safe, as you know what you're going to get. Not this time. I got my own pan pizza, which saved my boyfriend who got his own pizza, from being violently ill for 3 days. Im still feeling the stomach pain, although not the terrible twisting of death i was the days before. I phoned to inform them of what happened and of course, just as i thought, the person i spoke too did not care or say anything worth anything. I explained how I didn't want anything, just that they should probably know. They proceeded to tell me that i would need to see a doctor to prove what happened. I honestly do not care nearly enough to pay $10 for a doctors note to prove this. I am just warning other people that this was by far the most painful sick i have ever been in my life. Violently awful and lasted for days now. Please beware. . .","FINALLY made a visit to Lucille this past weekend and I can't wait to go back!  I'd heard mixed reviews on the pizza but honestly that's crazy!  That being said everything pales in comparison to their nachos. . . seriously. . . they are the best nachos I've ever had!  Their drinks are out of this world (which was expected since they're a Merchant step-sister) and the lounge in the basement is a MUST for after dinner socializing (tip: order the Mexican Firing Squad)!  Way to go Lucille, yet another killer restaurant added to Madison!","I had my daughter's 10th birthday here. The girls had a blast. We had pizza inside Pizini and then we went into their amazing theater to watch Kung Fu Panda 3. I had 11 very happy girls. They loved the reclining chairs and comfy seats. After the movie they played games in the arcade. This my family's favorite place to watch movies as well as spend quality time together. We love the bowling alley and the arcade games. . Laura was our party host, as well as the person who helped us set up the event. She did a great job. The entire staff was friendly and made my daughter's day perfect!","I was so excited for my sons 2nd bday party. It was aweful!! The host was everything but a host. A guest passed out cake and my husband stood at the door to hand out goodie bags. My party was from 4-6 and at 5:30 she started cleaning around people making it very awkward and guests left early. She was wearing a lower cut dress and I now have her cleavage in the pictures of my son blowing out his candles. . When I booked the party I was told that each child gets 2 pieces of pizza, they actually get 1 slice cut in half. I had 15 children and 2 babies, I was charged extra for the babies even though they never left their mothers arms. She wasnt a kid friendly person and would just hollar out that it was time for cake or pizza, getting nobodys attention I was forced to round up the kids and get them seated. She started a \"soda tab\" and they charge $1 for a can of soda. At the end of the party I had spent $100 more than planned on sodas, extra pizza and the ridiculous 18% gratuity that was added on to my bill. A $45 tip was not what I had in mind for her. When calling the owner to discuss my issue she did NOTHING to resolve it and might have well just called me a liar because she defended the host to the very end. I will not recommend TOY TOWN to anyone!! BAD BUSINESS!!!!","Ordered 5 pizzas at 11 for 11:45 pickup confirmed waiting for 25 minutes and pizza still not ready. . Got an \"oh sorry\".  . I watched 5 customers leave. One said, \" let's go for office max we stand a better chance of getting food. \"","This is the only place in Oakland where I purchase pizza as it's the only pizzeria that doesn't have a soft crust or use ten times more american cheese than mozzarella cheese. . Pizza Sola sells by the slice which is a nice option rather than having to buy by the pie as you have to in most of the other Oakland pizza joints. It's also cool to receive a large, prowess slice rather than the typically small slices usually found on campus. Unfortunately, Pizza Sola is not as busy as the other joints, so the slices have usually been sitting around for a while so that they are not as fresh.","Bartender, Jerry, took great care of me. He recommended the date/jalape\u00f1o pizza. Incredible! Highly recommended!!","The happy hour gang I hang out with frequents this place often. It's hard to find a decent martini in Cleveland, but I have to say they know how to shake an excellent one here. . I've been here a few times and the food has been consistently delicious every time. The pizzas really stand out. They're half price during happy hour. Oh and they're also a little smaller than the full priced fare, but they are still delicious. . The rest of the menu looks really delicious, but I don't know how many people know they have a full menu. People may think this is a bar only, yet there appear to be some really nice entrees as well. I'll need to come back and try those. . During warmer weather, this is one of the best patios around. I really want this place to succeed. This location has been cursed by so many failed restaurants. In my opinion, this place should be around for a long time. It's nice to have a classier, unpretentious wine and martini bar on the west side of town.","Still an excellent experience! I had not been there in a while, but I was on my way home and decided to stop for take-out. I ordered a house salad with chicken. The large portion easily fed two, the chicken was moist and well seasoned, and the house salad dressing is a Thousand Island-y sort of thing that is really good. I'll have to get back soon to re-try the pizza. . It is good to see places that maintain their quality standards over time.","I absolutely love their pizza and drive out of my way to get it, closest thing I have found to real New York style pizza. I would highly recommend the sausage.","Came here a couple months ago with a group of 4 on a Saturday night. We arrived at 10:15pm and got seated immediately. The restaurant look about 60% occupied. . As we were seated our server introduced himself, a soft spoken guy, and was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave his honest opinion when making recommendations. He seemed like a nice guy but came off sounding very condescending at times. I really don't appreciate servers who stereotype their tables based on their age and attire. All we ordered were a round of water and didn't get any refills after our initial glasses! . To be honest, most of the staff was pretty soft spoken as well. I'm not sure if it was because of the intimate/luxury feel they were trying to give but all of the team members in the restaurant were very quiet and quite honestly not very helpful either. . Anyways, we ended up ordering the Gotham and Truffle pizza which were large 16\" pies. Both of which our server had recommended as being popular choices among guests. . The Gotham was basically a meat lovers wet dream, it was topped with pepperoni, salami, sausage, and a handful of other ingredients. Overall it wasn't bad, but tbh I can't say I fell in love with it either. . The Truffle pizza was a major disappointment. Beware when you order it, it was very oily and certainly takes a refined pallet to enjoy. . Overall, we were not very impressed by what this place had to offer. Five 50 seemed like a knockoff more expensive dining version of Secret Pizza at The Cosmopolitan and the service was not worth what we paid. It was certainly a 1 time experience. . The breakdown: (for the price). Service: 2/5. Food Quality: 3/5. Atmosphere: 4/5. All 4 of us shared 2 large pizzas and it cost us $66. . Tip* You'll get more bang for your buck by going to secret pizza at The Cosmopolitan.","Awesome, well-priced pizza. Tasty, cheap snacks (arancini). Beautiful space - the decor is phenomenal for a counter-service place. Much higher-end all around (quality of food, quality of ambience) than you'd expect for the price point - even the napkins were high-class! A phenomenal addition to downtown. Go there immediately!","About ten years ago I searched for a Pizza place that taste like the ones we have in Michigan. And, we have our share of great pizza shops in the Mid West. I was told about Beach Pizza, went there, and have never been disappointed with their Pizza. It is my \"Special Treat\" when i need one. They are fast, friendly, and the price doesn't make you feel like you are back in California. Beach, I love your Pizza.","We love the theme of oregano's. super cozy to come here on a date. We ordered parmesan chicken with Caesar salad and enjoyed it so much! Would totally recommend this place to anyone! We've come here on multiple events with big groups and just me and my husband at times and the customer service here never let us down. Super friendly waiters and great food and will never go bad. Also they have really good Thin crust pizza","When I saw this place show up as a Hot New Business on the Yelp frontpage, I thought it was a bit of a silly name. But it tells you everything you need to know about the business. Think Subway/Chipotle (Custom Built Sandwich/Burrito) assembly line style ordering, but for pizza.  $8. 95 gets you a 12-inch pizza with all the toppings you want. According to their website:. (4) kinds of sauces. (4) kinds of cheeses, which you can combine together. (7) kinds of meats. (7) kinds of veggies. (7) kinds of toppers, added after the pizza is cooked. Who else sells you a (potentially) 25-topping pizza for $8. 95?!  I don't know if I would try it. Except that I totally would if I could order it without feeling like a bit of a jerk. Once you order your pie, you'll have it within minutes; these cook fast.  10 minutes after setting foot into the restaurant I had my food!. For my very first custom built pizza I had the spicy diavola sauce, fresh mozzarella, Italian sausage, mushroom, garlic and sun dried tomatoes (photo: http://www. yelp. com/biz_photos/CeqWpwHBoaxwRcv5btnv6g?select=zg2BAK39ZOP7M6bmZmAF7Q#tqe5lahN7SPZZw2mLVaFag). I can still taste the spicy diavola and garlic in my breath, and I'm quite okay with that. No gum for me, I'm still enjoying my pizza. Tasty ingredients all around, and the crust keeps a chewy consistency with a slight crunch.  . You want to ask me out for dinner? How the heck are you gonna do that? You can build me a pizza or something. I am a fan and I will most definitely be back.","While shopping in the Strip, we wanted to grab a quick bite for a late lunch. We stopped in and I got two slices of pepperoni pizza. The slices were enormous, covered in pepperoni and piping hot. I'm normally more of a thick crust fan, but the crispy thin crust here was on point. I scarfed down my two slices, which were probably more like four slices of normal sized pizza, and headed back out the door. . Will definitely be back for another slice, or three.","This restaurant is my favorite in Phoenix. Every  item on the menu that I have tried has been perfect. Always consistent, no matter what day or time of day. Some of their specials are to die for. If it weren't for calories, I would be there 3-4 times a week. . They have like 4 different locations, I have tried  three of them, once again the word is consistency! Same perfect meal each time. . Even lunch or just a slice of pizza is as good as I have had anywhere. . On a funny note, they are a bit quirky with the items you can put on a slice of pizza. Doesn't make sense, but no big deal. I love this place. . Well managed, good service and amazing food at a fair price. What more can you ask for??. Oh yea, a nice little bar too, perfect for a few cocktails. Very comfortable!","We went for dinner and it was alright. The bruschetta was the best part of the meal! The pizza was soggy and the quinoa salad was alright.","I've been coming to this Sauce for quite a while and its consistently good. I don't think I've ever had a bad experience because I always know what to expect. . The pizza is good, salads are solid, and the mac n' cheese. . . well, lets just say I'm a sucker it. Every time we come to eat here the service is friendly and helpful, probably the best I've had from a \"fast casual\" type of restaurant. . I definitely recommend sauce if you're looking for something fairly quick but delivers on quality.","Every once in a while I love to remind myself as to why I don't order delivery from chain pizza places like Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's, etc. sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised and tonight I was not. . Over an hour and a half delivery time and I received a soggy medium pan pizza. But what had me most concerned is that my pizza was pulled out of the oven and checked at 6:35ish and was sitting there for over 45 min before it left the store. . After delivery fees and tips for $16 I recommend eating a frozen pizza because at least you can pull it out when it's actually done baking. Me, didn't have access to an oven. Otherwise I know what I would've done. Baked a pizza.","i enjoy pizza hut but I personally dont like the oversized chicken and I know its not them but all i ordered was chicken but the kids loved the pizza and the mild chicken. they were 5, 7, &amp; 2.","It's good for an afternoon of coffee and deserts but DEFINITELY not a place to have lunch or dinner. I've had better pizza!!!!!","Came in during lunch. Pretty busy inside but nice atmosphere has a really nice patio seating area. Got the garlic knots as an appetizer very good! Got the margarita pizza with sausage on it super yummy!","It doesn't happen often, but every now and then a brewery has amazing food. This is one of those breweries. We have been here several times and the beer keeps us coming back, but I would only rate it 4 stars on beer alone. Our last trip, we decided to indulge in the Duck Pizza. We are so glad we did! The duck was moist and the pizza was drizzled with a tangy barbeque sauce that worked to bring immense flavor to the dish. I am excited to return to try more of their food. . The unique thing about taking their beer to go: they put it in a sealed can instead of a growler. Very convenient if you need to travel with your beer.","The food here was great!. We had tuna tar tar app, 5/5. Then spicy ribs and tuna pizza. Both great. He ribs fell off the bone. . Dessert was this flaming hot choc thing that was awesome!. Def come and enjoy top notch sushi and sake in a beautiful setting!!","Honestly this was so good. I have eaten there twice in one week. The pizza was amazing and then we went back for pasta. Seriously the service was wonderful and the food YUM. But the price was the best part. We had wine, appetizers, salad and full entrees and the bill was . . . . wait for it. . . . $48 bucks. WHOOHOO.","Awesome place. Visited from California. . . wish we had something like this place here. Got the fontina burger one day and the BBQ Chicken pizza the next. The \"grilled\" pizza has an awesome charred taste. . Wish I could have tried the apple fritters but I walked up to the counter at 11:01 and they had stopped serving breakfast. They should really serve those all day long.","When you have three kids under 10 and a 4 month old (Aunt duty), cooking dinner is the last thing on your mind. At least for the inexperienced over here lol. . I wanted to try something new, so I found the closest NY pizza place to my house. Ordered two large pizzas with garlic balls (12) and was happy with the order. The pizza was made perfect. My only complaint is that I had to wait even when I arrived over thirty minutes past the time given for the food to be ready.","Second time here. . . . Should have written a review from my first visit several years ago, it would have been better. . We liked it so much the first time that we planned on eating there when we went down to Boulder City. . We stopped in at dinner time and only a few people were seated outside. . We ordered an antipasto salad, spaghetti &amp; meatballs and a small cheese pizza. . The salad came out first, it was some cold cuts and cheese sliced in strips on top of iceberg lettuce that had seen better days, tomatoes were mushy from being cut early that morning, lots of ripe olives, banana peppers and oregano. Not too appealing to the eye and I've had better. Silverware would also be nice instead of plastic forks, if you're paying almost 9 bucks for a salad, it would be better not to eat with plastic. The spaghetti came with one meatball. The meatball was very flavorful, wish there was more. . The sauce was also very flavorful and thick. . The pizza, although again not eye appealing the crust with the sauce did have great flavor. . If you like tomatoes, you're going to like the sauce. The cheese kept sliding off but it was good &amp; chewy. . Eating outside was nice, no atmosphere inside, and appeared that it needs a good cleaning. . .","Had their pizza, that was awesome. It was one loaded up with stuff that I can't remember, but it was fab. . Went back tonight and was a tad disappointed in what came with the gyro platter. Some good places that I've been to put a little medley of things, which it had but was just olives, and those green things that end in cini. There's a place in Seattle that I have yet to find which compares. These guys put rice, hummus, feta, olives, tzatziki, and a small greek salad on the side which you can make an awesome wrap with!  And there was more portion for the same price. The meat was good, and everything was good, but I won't order that again. Seattle's ruined me. If you are ever in Seattle, you must go to Mr. Gyro's. I will confidently say that you will not find anyone who makes them better, if so, you got damn lucky!","I am a big big fan of a good piece of pizza. . . this is some real good pizza. Good sauce, awesome crust. Laid back atmosphere to the restaurant. Good service. Overall I am very pleased with this restaurant.","My first time but probably won't return. We had a party of five and didn't get drinks or a waiter for about 20 minutes. . . then once we did order they gave us our drinks in plastic cups you get at Walmart. . . Our beer also was served in a plastic cup then we noticed people around us had glasses. So it was hit or miss, but once we did ask for a glass the server gave us attitude about it. We ordered a lot of food so the time in getting it was understandable. The prices we mild but I didn't feel like we got what we paid for. The pizza wasn't bad but the service and cheap plates, cups etc. wasn't a positive vibe.","Kicker's Pizza is a Brook Park treasure!! The wings are amazing and the chicken philly is quite possibly the perfect sandwich. The homemade blue cheese should be sold in stores, too. The pizza is made from scratch - no frozen crusts or canned sauce. It's the real deal. Try the wing pizza or the BLT Pizza for something unique.","ok I'm upgrading my review - it only takes one dish and the Oski wow  wow wow shrimp blew me away. It was perfectly executed: hot, crispy, with just the right amount of sauce: imagine healthy buffallo wings - and it was a busy world cup final atmosphere. . Who says you can't get decent shrimp in the Midwest? My mom does - she's from the Philippines and hasn't been here since 1975 - I'm bringing her when she comes next June for my wedding. Oh and about her - she's a serious wine snob. Guess what? They serve Decoy wine - one of the best wineries from Sonoma. Didn't want my positive review for server Jessie to get lost - she was very kid friendly and efficient. Manager Derrick and staff are young, friendly, and motivated to make this place the best sports bar in south central. They tell me to come back for the thin crust stone baked pizza. I certainly will.","This pizza was very flavorful!  We got an all meat one and we were not disappointed.  . We got back to our room at Excalibur at around 11:45 after seeing Britney Spears. We were starving and decided to call this place. It was delivered in 45 minutes. Not bad. It tasted home-made, and the delivery man was a nice man.  . I lived everything about our experience, except for the fact that the woman on the phone who took my order was short in her words, giving me a bit of attitude. That's the only reason I am not giving a 5-star rating.","Great pizza, hands down awesome crust and toppings. We had the Forager and the balance between mushrooms meatiness and spinach earthiness was spot on. Good service and modest price makes this is a winner choice. Arugula and delicate squash salad was very unique and not too sweet in spite of the cranberry pur\u00e9e and citrus dressing. Give it a try if you are in the mood to try something different.","Got a flyer on our door so we thought we'd give them a try. . . glad we did! We took advantage of their \"anytime party special\" of 2 pizzas, garlic balls and a soda. Excellent crust- hand tossed but not too thick and chewy. Great texture and flavor! Garlic balls were also good- I like a little more garlic flavor, but they were definitely good! We will explore other items they offer in the future!","I live in Cleveland but this store is close to Cleveland so they deliver in my area. Good pizza, a wide variety on the menu and the price point is spot on. The pizza crust is fresh and the ingredients are fresh as well. I have had the chicken wrap several times and it is huge and enough for two meals. It is fresh chicken and has a great flavor. One time the wrapper was on the dry side though. So next time I order I will mention that . I have had the chicken tenders and they were good as well. They offer a variety of sandwiches hot and cold, chicken wings, pasta dinners, desserts and of course pizza. The shrimp alfredo dinner was very good and had a nice flavor. The sauce was not on the thick side. I had the pasta dinner with sausage and mushrooms and it was very very good. I have had the cheesecakes there and they are not home made but ok when you have a sweet tooth. The deliveries are very quick. I went to the actual store and it was clean and I watched them prepare the food and they used gloves. They are always friendly and polite. The store is located off Lorain Road closer to the Fairview Bridge and Kamn's Corner area. There is plenty of parking and you can bike there if you want.","New place. Seated near the bar in a booth so there was always someone passing by to give me updates on the food and keep my drink filled. Because it's such a deep dish pizza, you're not going to get it in five minutes. Give yourself some time to hang out while it cooks (I ordered wings, which were good, to hold me over until the pizza was ready). I could eat two pieces  and took the rest home because there's so much. I actually laughed when I picked up the box because it was so heavy.  (It warms up delicious too!).","I'm not usually one to criticize, but I read the good reviews for this place and it seemed like a pretty safe bet. Went on a Saturday evening and the place wasn't crowded at all ;-) Our server, Matthew was fantastic - a really nice guy. . We ordered a large pizza with 4 toppings but the pizza arrived with only 3 of the 4. Matthew was very apologetic and said he would bring us a glass of wine on the house for the mistake. He left and returned a few minutes later saying they wouldn't allow him to give us a free glass of wine, but he could take the charge off of the bill. Being a business owner myself, I though, hmmm, pretty poor customer service. The pizza itself was fine, however, we ordered it with sliced tomatoes and much to our chagrin, it seems the tomatoes were the first thing put on the pizza because there was no sauce, cheese or anything else under them and they covered 80% of the pizza. The sausage was sparse at best with maybe 10 pieces on the 18\" pizza. The crust was so thin in the center that it couldn't even hold the tomatoes without disintegrating. So it was disappointing, but on the other hand, the patio was very nice and Matthew was great. If I could give the management one piece of advice, it would be to never let a customer leave disappointed - it may have cost him a glass or two of house wine, but I would have returned.","Pretty fancy restaurant especially since its across the walk way to Herm\u00e8s lol. There's a dress code- no tank tops for men but they will accommodate you to the outside patio , which was fine. The waiter was really nice and professional even though we were kind of tipsy and being annoying. I thought it was fancy how the popcorn chicken came with actual popcorn(never seen this before). The green pizza was great as well; who could've thought that a pizza with no meat could taste so delicious. The food was great i just wished the waiter told us about their gratuity fee. I always thought that was a requirement.","I absolutely knew I would love this wine bar from the moment I saw it from the outside! The decor is amazing and perfect, everything about it flows and it's very rustic modern looking. The wine was superb and we indulged in the house meatballs which were also delicious. The food was made out by the bar and you could tell it's very fresh and housemade. The wood fired pizzas looked amazing but we had other plans for dinner. All around beautiful and classy place that I'm very sad to have to leave behind!","Bruno was recommended to us by a good friend and they did not stear us wrong. One of the best pizzas we have had in a LONG time. The sauce was so Good and the staff was great. On little surprise was the Cesar salad. The owner shared that they make all their own dressings so we had to give it a try Spook good. Give Bruno a try and the only problem you'll have is trying to figure out when to return to try something different.","Do yourself a favor: Order Carry Out, not delivery. I order here like twice a month, but about 1/3 of the time I order delivery they attempt to deliver my pizza to the wrong apartment. . Not sure why their drivers can't plug my address into Google Maps and figure out where I am. The staff at this location have proven to be incredibly incompetent and I am sick of giving them 2nd, 3rd and 4th chances.","Wow I have been here four or five times. The first couple were a few months ago and I thought the pizza and pasta was great! I'm from Chicago and appreciated having this nearby. Well I'm not sure what happened but the past three times in the last two months are unacceptable. Just bad. First visit -- watery spaghetti and meatballs. It was marginally ok . . . I ate it. The garlic bread was . . . Terrible, I could have made better with wonder bread and garlic salt which is basically what it was . . . Second time, I waited in line and their computer system went down it was a Friday night and they had no clue what to do. . . I forgave them for this, it happens but they could have written down my order and made my pizza . . . They were completing orders and had other customers they just decided to freak out and not take mine, how did people order pizza and pay before computers? I had cash too. Third time tonight is just unacceptable. I don't eat a lot of pizza or carbs, when k to it's a treat . . . I just spent $35 for a take and bake pizza (it was not cooked) and eggplant Parmesan (which was surprisingly ok) but the garlic bread was also not cooked. When I say this stuff was not cooked I mean it was not cooked. I had to break out my toaster oven which I did not appreciate. Terrible. I guess I have to find a new place or stick with due forni even though they are not really a take out place, huge disappointment I was hungry. . . 3 strikes you are out.","It's been awhile since my first visit to Charbar when it first opened and although I didn't have the best experience that time around, I must say that I've truly enjoyed my last three visits here! All of them have been for their brunch or lunch service. I've been able to try the deep fried french toast bites, bagna cauda, asado plate, jamon crudo pizza, and during Big Taste their feature breakfast burger. . Today I ordered one of the lunch features which was a pizza that featured roasted chicken and crispy chicken skin on top! Like what, who does that?! The crispy chicken skin is what sold me and I definitely thought it finished off the pizza so well. Their pizza dough by the way is bomb because it comes from Sidewalk Citizen =) Our server today was lovely (I wish I remembered his name, I am the worst at that!) He was very personable and made sure we were taken care of throughout our meal. And just a small thing that I noticed was that more than one person (that didn't include our server) ensured that we always had water in our glass. I appreciate that attentiveness because it really shows that they work as a team. . P. S. their beef fat fries are amazeballs! They are the type of fries that you can't stop eating no matter how full you are. . Reserving my last star for when I am able to go back and try their dinner menu again, but if my last few visits indicate anything, I'm sure it won't be hard to give =)","In the past, there were spans when I would order pizza WAY too often. Lately, I've been eating a lot healthier. . . though, I'm not made of stone. . Of the delivery pizza places, I like Pizza Hut the most. Their on-line ordering feature is extremely intuitive, allowing you to visually customize your exact order. . This particular location just so happens to be the one assigned to deliver to my location. In the short time I've lived here, I've always had pleasant experiences with the delivery people. They always seem to be happy, and are decently engaged. Also, they always seem to arrive early or on-time. . . which is kind of important. . All in all, the Via Linda Pizza Hut is a reliable choice for a decent pizza in my opinion. . If you're looking for a tasty break from the normal pizza, try a Thin Crust Chicken + Jalapeno. . . but be warned. . . I think Pizza Hut harvests some of these peppers from the center of the sun. Not ALL of them. . . but there are a few that make you sniffle something fierce.","With having three kids in the house we differently eat a lot of pizza. By far the best pizza I have had in the area. We moved in a couple blocks away and this will for sure be a walking distance dinner spot for us. Oh and the wings amazing. First place I have asked for extra crispy and they understood what I meant!!! Loved it! And the fact that its family owned and they are super nice just made it even better.","A place that delivers in Gilbert? Yes, yes, yes!!! I wasn't certain while using the app for delivery whether it was accurate or not. I've spent the past 9 months in Gilbert with very limited delivery options. When I say limited, I mean, there's been but a couple pizza joints to order from. . I'm not really a pizza enthusiast so, I've starved many late nights for this reason. . I always check just to see if there have been changes. Well, two places apparently deliver. In my disbelief, first thing I did was call to check since they appeared to be a little ways away. The gentleman was very kind on the phone in confirming they'd come out to us. I used the app to place my order because I feel it's much easier that way. Therefore I was basing it off of the menu on here. I ordered samosas for the kid, a combo beef shrimp kabob platter for the man, a side of kabuli style rice and the vegetable qorma. I was so excited! Within minutes I received a call from the restaurant to inform me they no longer served the vegetable qorma, and so went with the spinach qorma instead. . Honestly, the call alone was a very noble move on their end. Not to mention, I just checked to see what it was that I ordered and it appears that the menu has already been updated on the Yelp app so, kudos for that as well!. Although the wait time was closer to the 75 minute mark, the order arrived still hot and correct. . That rice? So so so so so good! I didn't try much of anyone else's dishes and can't speak to much more other than they looked appealing and no one complained. The 7 year old didn't even make a stink about this foreign item that she devoured. I may have skipped the extra side had I realized my dish came with some but I had it today, four days later, for lunch and it was still off the chain. . We will definitely order from here again and I will definitely tell all of the neighbors about the place!","We were traveling in the area and our first visit we both ordered seafood dishes and were less than impressed. My brother's shrimp gnocchi dish was fishy smelling and tasting, my crab fish dish tasted like cheap frozen fish or old fish. However, the 2nd night we ordered Italian and were very satisfied. We enjoyed both the Mediterranean and the Caesar salads and then a pizza and a stuffed pizza (their version of a calzone). Definitely go Italian.","This might be the best pizza I have ever eaten. New York style thin crust with high quality ingredients on top. They have thick crust selections as well. New York theme and decor. Very friendly and good service. The place is packed in the evening even on weekdays. Superb price/value on food and drinks. Located across 215 about 20 minutes from the strip in the suburbs of Las Vegas. If you go by cab be prepared to wait a long time for one to pick you up. There are not many destinations for cab drivers in this part of Vegas so they do not like driving one way without a fare to pick you up.","On the positive side, the place has nice ambiance and the staff is very friendly. On the negative side, the food just isn't that good and our service was a bit slow. We tried the crispy chicken sandwich which was a bunch of bun and a small piece of chicken. Two different burgers were tried with the sides mixed up on each. Last was a wood fired pizza which came out 15 minutes after everything else. It was evidently the pizza guys first night, and it showed. The pizza was soggy in the middle and not what a wood fired pizza should be. I would love to say I would try again, but when 4 out of 4 entrees are average to not good, it is hard to recommend.","The food is great. The service is. . bad. . very bad. . Upon arrival we were told just go find a seat anywhere there was only 1 booth open and 2 with tons of dishes on them. We went to the open booth because we have a baby and it's easier to block her into the inside of a booth. We go to the booth and it was super dirty the server came by and cleaned it for us after a few minutes. She came back and took our drink orders at which point we also ordered the street fry appetizer. They were delicious but they took 15 minutes to get out which in my opinion is a long time for fries. While we were waiting for the appetizer we ordered our main course. We were 1 of 2 tables left at this point. After finishing the appetizer it was another 20 minutes for the main course in which time our server never returned to our table to refill our glasses which were all empty at this point or to even ask how we were doing. FINALLY our food shows up on their station with the heat lamps where it sat , while our server chatted with the bartender, for another 10 minutes. She finally decided to bring us our food and says oh I'll be back to refill your drinks which didn't happen for ANOTHER 10 minutes. She finally returned and 1 of my party of 4 sent their wings back. They were burnt to a crisp and cold simultaneously. . weird. . she offered to bring him a slice of pizza, which she did, after yet another 15 minutes. At this point nobody was hungry anymore everyone's food was cold so we sat, another 15 minutes. Before finally I got up and asked the server who again was chatting with the bar tender for our boxes and our bill. She brings our bill fairly quickly at that point. . the only thing she did quickly. Honestly. . if it wasn't for the amazing pizza here it would be a 1 star review, but, the food really is very good. Just order it to go. . you don't want to leave with a bad taste in your mouth from the untrained service who couldn't care less about you or your experience.","The Ruben pizza was really pretty awesome. I would eat this again any day. We ordered the club pizza as well, but it left a little to be wanted and didn't disappear as quickly. I would give a 3. 5 if I could, but take points away for being cash only.","I thought this place was great, all though rather pricey. I went for a work meal while in Vegas for a conference. As a group we got several appetizers. I tasted the bruschetta and the four cheese pizza which were both yummy. The others had prawns and calamari which they raved over but I don't eat seafood.  . For dinner I chose the lamb chops. They were absolutely amazing!  My only disappointment was that it said it came with gnocchi and I literally had 8 pieces of gnocchi on my plate. For $52 for the entree I would expect a few more gnocchi. . For dessert I had the italian donuts which were delightful and plenty to share.","I really enjoyed this place. It was cheaper than the nearby hotels, the little food spot right outside the habitat elevators was decent for breakfast sandwiches and pizza. Not to mention their rad staff there who were always pleasant! I had a stellar view of the high roller which looked beautiful at sunrise. I will definitely stay here again. Thanks, Flamingo!","This pizza is absolutely delicious. We are in town for a work/pleasure trip and  went based on other yelp recommendations and were not dissappointed. Their red pizza was a perfect blend of crust, sauce and cheeses. Very tasty. We also ordered a white pie with spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms ( I don't know that they were canned, but they seemed to be precooked) and sweet white onions. The crust was smeared with a sort of garlic oil spread, then the toppings and finished with a blend of cheeses. It arrived perfectly cooked and piping hot from the oven. There are a few booths in the back with a sort of help yourself drink set-up. The staff could not have been any friendlier. This will be our go to pizza place the next time we are in Pittsburgh!","I would like to give Danny Boys three stars, but it's better than all the competition that I've tried in the area as far as taste, price and quality of pizza. I really haven't found a pizza I can devote myself to in this area. . The garlic knots that came with the salad were delicious. We really enjoyed the thin crust pizza we had when we dined in. Very tasty pepperoni and Parmesan recipe. . The regular crust pizza we ordered for carry out next time was pretty good too, but not as good as the thin. . Some of the specialty pizzas really looked good. Can't wait to try them. . It's not Coccia House, but what is.","Great casual atmosphere - sorta retro trendy. If you've been to the Joe's real BBQ in old town Gilbert, then you know the setup here, grab your food and choose to eat inside or outside in the family friendly open-air 'back yard'. I prefer the latter, built out of an old farmhouse (I understand it was the owner's childhood home) there lots of mature trees, green grass, not to mention the small working farm behind the restaurant really helps to  transport you back to a time when this area wasn't a sea of cookie-cutter homes and Walgreen's on ever corner. . Enough about the place, what about the food. I'd say if you're looking for BBQ go to Old town, they have it here, and it's good, but it's not the same. Personally, I think the grilled pizza's really stood out, noticeably fresh ingredients really were a flavorful surprise - definitely not the 'Mall-food' someone else here had mentioned. . I enjoyed it and Joe's Farm Grill it's a perfect place for a Sunday afternoon lunch with the family to get out and enjoy a beautiful Arizona day!","We came for Sunday lunch. No one here but thats fine with us. Service was great. Ordered pizza and 8pc chicken combo. 4 of us enjoyed and had leftovers for the week. Food is amazing. Best chicken ever. Kfc who?","This is our favorite pizza place in Las Vegas for more than 10 years now. We just keep coming back!May it be for lunch, dinner or party! Yummy pizza, fries, gyros, phily cheesesteak and many more! My kids love their meat lovers and chicken alfredo pizza. Ben, the owner is awesome too!  May it be dine in, pick up, take out or delivery. . . you wont be disappointed!","This is one of the better lunch spots in Scottsdale. Any salad and any pizza for a flat price (I think $9). Very reasonable. Great atmosphere, easy parking, fast service. So many salad and pizza options you will never get bored.","Good hot dog, great fries and the best pizza puff in the state! We just ordered a few things but will be back for more.","Just finished lunch. The atmosphere was very pleasant. The food was really good. I had a custom pizza and feel that it was reasonably priced. The service was fine and the food came out in a timely fashion. I was somewhat reticent to go after reading the pther Yelp reviews but experienced none of the conditions depicted in previous reviews. The fact that they all menyioned yhe same vompetitor makes me wonder if there aren't some shenanigans going on. My advice is to try it if you like brick oven thin crust pizza. You won't be disappointed.","4. 5/5! Definitely one of Toronto's best kept secrets when it comes to thin crust pizza! Recommend the antipasti minto to start and the famous Bufalina pizza (large enough to share depending on appetite)!","The pizza was burn over cooked. We eat three slices and make up no taste to it. Would not recommend this place for their pizza. At the end we asked for a box, the staff make us a small container for more than a half of a pizza. Not even a pizza box .",". . . . Not good . . . . . They're saying my review is too short so I'll expound. We got the cocktail of the day. Pear vodka with prosecco. 3/10. The margarita pizza was a sloppy mess as you could see from the picture. It felt like they rain it through the dishwasher before the brought it out to us. Gnocchi was average, pretty bland.","Cool place. Took my wife and son to the recline and dine (movies. ) Overall, pretty cool spot to check a flick. Prices are decent, the place is clean, and comfortable. I like the idea of reclining on a chair. Seats recline and food is served here. Based on previous reviews I was afraid to order food from their pizza place so I have no opinion on the food. The movie experience was great though.","Eh. . . it's pizza pizza. Looks like pizza. Tastes like what you would expect. Comes hot, maybe fresh. . Not a lot of other places open here at midnight. . Washrooms aren't too clean and smells a bit weird. . . Oh, I think their Large with 3 toppings and 3 cans has actually gotten cheaper from before cause we got it for $13. 99 plus tax.","I can't say enough good things about Piola. I moved into the building late last year and have probably visited the restaurant, or had take out, close to 10 times already. Eating in the staff are very friendly, attentive and helpful. Taking out they are always fast. . Must endorse the San Danielle pizza - fresh mozzarella with parma ham, mmmm and do NOT forget to ask for the chili oil, it is the perfect compliment if you like a little bit of spice. The Diavola pizza with spicy salami is equally delicious. The crust here is right up there with Terroni and the prices are about the same if not a bit lower. . Would also endorse the spaghetti and meatballs, so so tender the meatballs fall apart with a fork and the pasta is perfectly cooked with fresh curls of parmesan all over the top. . Look for the great daily specials - Wednesdays is half price bottles of wine! So awesome. I believe kids eat free on Sundays too.","Discovered Tryst (Organic) Cafe shortly after it opened about 2+ yrs ago. Have had breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner there. They have organic everything - food, beer, wine, even vodka - which is what drew me at first. Also many gluten free choices. . They've had their ups &amp; downs with service, but it's usually good. The happy hour is limited and should be improved in both hours &amp; choices. . My wife &amp; I both love their Seered Ahi Tuna Salad, it's fantastic! We both want and need a good organic cafe in the area and hate to see the pizza place next door packed while the healthy restaurant is lightly filled. Help Tryst thrive!","GREAT food and fast delivery. Highly recommend the chicken Cesar pizza. Yum yum yum!!","Ordered sushi pizza and extra salmon sushi combo. Food came quickly and the quality of the salmon in the sashimi was very good. Food quality was good, portions reasonable, and prices are reasonable. Good place to come for a quick meal.","Recently I noticed a sign outside my local Pizza Nova advertising a medium pepperoni pizza for $4. 39 on Tuesday May 12 for walk in customers. $! from each sale is going to support Variety Village. I walked in today and tried one. It was a fresh tasty well made pizza. My only quibble was that it had too much salt for my taste. I applaud their gesture of support for a fine cause. The regular walk in price for that basic pizza is $8. 49.","Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and I could not resist a slice of pizza and a beer for $5. It turned out to be a good choice. I liked the pizza. It has a crispy crust and they really load up the toppings. It's also a very large slice of pizza. I was pleasantly full after just one slice. Not that it stopped me from ordering a second slice. . We also tried the bruschetta appetizer, which was quite good. The serve a bowl of the mixed up toppings with a generous portion of toasted crostini. My only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more finely. The chunks were large and there were only about 5 or 6 of them, so you could really portion it out well for a couple dozen crackers. Not a big deal, really. . I'll be back.","We found this place several years ago and had some family with us. We ordered pizza, salad and garlic knots. Everything was so delicious. We visted a few more times over the next few years and everything was so very good. Last night proved it will be the last time. A 16' pizza is now $20 or more. All the prices went up and we were told it is because of the minimum wage hike. They only have one size pizza. We ordered garlic knots they were not hot at all and sent them back. We asked for our pizza to be a little crispy and half of it ended up being burnt. We have always asked to be a little crispy and it always came out so good, not this time. Ordered 6 wings $6. 50 for 6 wings. They were very good. We asked for 1 ranch dressing to dip our pizza crust in. We got charged . 60c for a souffle cup. Nope that was it. So very dissatisfied overall. Service was mediocre. Guess all customers will have to pay for the minimum wage hike, tipping no longer needed.","My boyfriend and I heard about this place from a friend so we decided to try it out. Food and service was awesome! We had Tyler as our server; he was super nice and just the right amount of attentive. He also was really knowledgable about their beer list as well as the menu. . We ordered a lot more food then we could have finished, but it was all amazing. The chicken wings with fries as delicious (I'd take a giant bowl of the fries alone because they were addictive), garlic buns (easily a meal in itself) that were actually garlicky, and we got the smallest size \"Back Home\" pizza (I think that's what it was called) which we took half home for leftovers. . Definitely recommend Naked City Tavern. It's nice to have a place to just relax with good beers and good food locally.","What a wonderful find! Delicious, inventive, hand-crafted food, together with warm &amp; welcoming service in a fun Downtown locale. We enjoyed everything we tried, and since there were four of us and we did everything family style, we tried a lot! Highlights included the beets &amp; gnudi, the mushroom polenta, the cacio e pepe, the butternut squash agnotti, and the butterscotch dessert. The bacon/onion/egg pizza and crispy pancetta cavatelli were also great. Thanks to Eric for superb service and to James, the chef, for creating a truly terrific restaurant and coming out to chat with us. We'll be back again and again.","Went here for a business lunch, cozy little spot in a smaller strip mall. I'm not overly familiar with this part of the South Hills so I drove by it initially. . I can't speak much about the menu as I only ordered a small plain pizza, which admittedly was pretty good. Other folks has the tossed salad, pizza soup and an Italian hoagie. The hoagie looked like it was pretty good. . Is definitely come back to try some of their pastas. Our waitress was attentive and kept our drinks full during our meeting but she had a very snarky attitude. I'm pretty used to it though as it seems to be the standard for old-school Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.","Used to go to the River location often when I lived on the Westside. I now go to the Broadview Heights location and the food is great! The service has always been so so at either location, but the food makes up for it. REAL better ingredients, better pizza! Nothing in B heights or Royalton comes close!","The pizza was good but a little cold, delivery took longer than expected, but all in all the pizza was good. I will highly recommend if you are a fan of good pizza.","When I got home to eat my pizza it barely had any cheese, banana peppers and pepperoni. Next time I'll pay the extra fee for more toppings, if I ever from here again.","I actually located Upper Crust by doing a search of the area on Yelp. Once I read the reviews and saw that they were like Grimaldi's, I knew had to give it a whirl. . I got there like an hour before closing on a Sun night and they were very gracious hosts. They didn't force us out or make us feel rushed at all. . I can't give more stars because I didnt try the pizza yet. We just had drinks and an appetizer. But the service is 5-stars for sure!","The last time we ordered from this place is took an hour and a half to get our food. We decided to give it another try, we ordered tonight, they said it would be 45 mins-1 hour. THREE HOURS later we call them ( for a second time) and they say the pizza is still at the restaurant, \"we got busy, we can't help it\". I can understand getting busy, but why would anybody even want a pizza that's been sitting there for more than 2 hrs?! And we're less than 5 miles down Durango from them. The food is decent, but we won't be ordering from them again. Don't waste your time.","Great restaurant! Great service and great pizzas! Consistently good service and excellent food. Great Beers on tap. Friendly staff and decent prices. . Will continue to go back!!","Guy's Pizza Co. Coventry Location has an average of 2. 5 stars, say what?! I can't believe these 1 and 2 star reviews!? I have always experienced friendly and fast service at this Guy's pizza location. Although I have to admit the only time I go here is before I go to a show at the Grog Shop. I'd have to say I like the NYC small pizza joint vibe. The place is always filled with HS kids hanging out, laughing, and eating. . It has been my tradition ever since Guys opened on Coventry Rd and the Grog moved to its south Coventry Rd location - that before a show I get a slice of pizza and a can of Tahitian Treat for only $2. 75!. On this particular evening before the Chelsea Peretti - America Treasure Tour show. I went in for my ritual slice &amp; can of TT. And there was no more TT!!! I was sadden by the lack of product and the counter girl shared my disappointment. I reluctantly ordered a Sprite. As I left the manager came in with a whole bunch of Tahitian Treats -and the counter girl gave me one on the house!! Granted it's only $0. 75 but, it was the thought that counted and for that I give them 5 STARS!!!!. By the looks of the other reviews they don't do delivery or big orders well. So, I say if you want a quick bite while shopping, walking around Coventry, or before a show this the place to go!","My husband and I came here for the first time on Friday night and had a blast. Our Server Jamie was FABULOUS and totally made our experience top notch!! The beer (we both ordered the flight), the food (we shared calamari, fish and chips as well as a pizza ), and the staff were all awesome. I cannot say enough about this place. I cant wait to come back and bring even more people. Thank you Jamie for making our night truly great. We will be back real soon!!!","The staff was super nice and delivery was quick. However for three large pizzas it was over $72. The pizzas were plain with no flavor. Looked beautiful but zero spice","This is the best pizza &amp; pasta dishes at the lake by far. This place is the real deal starting with the New York atmosphere &amp;  making you feel at home from the start. Great food at at very modest price. You will have food left over to take home. The Meatballs &amp; sauces are  delicious &amp; all the breads / desserts are made daily  right there. Italian food at its Finest. . .","I've been here a few times for early evening drinks. The ambiance of the place is great! Very swanky in red and black. The location is nice too, it seems an odd place for a lounge but I like it. I don't have to go to the strip or downtown to get that little bit of extra over your regular neighborhood bar. . It's pretty mellow and quite enough to have a conversation, which is a rare find for a bar! But on my most recent visit last night (a Friday night) it was getting a little loud with a band setting up. Nevertheless the vibe is what sells me on this place. I'm heading there again tonight for a 1st date. Hopefully the Saturday night vibe doesn't kill the chill lounge vibe. . Lastly, on the menu, this is why it only gets 3 stars. I haven't eaten much here but nibbled on a few fries, or the like, from others plates. I don't remember  finding much for vegetarian options. They seem limited to the pretzel bites, make your own pizza, or a veggie burger. They don't even have a vegetarian salad, how odd is that? It's a SALAD. You're supposed to be focusing on the veggies in that case. Pretty boring in my opinion. Asking for subtractions or substitutions is a pain but if your diet is other than avid carnivore you'll need to be that person here. Friends that are carnivores say the food is good though.","I was craving pizza on Friday and decided to stop by. I normally order takeout and have ordered from this place three times previously. My go to is a medium pizza with pepperoni, pineapple and tomato but this time I decided to try out the pizza and wings combo. Fridays are busy and my wait time was 45mins. Previous visits were a 15min wait. . A steady flow of customers would walk in to pick up their order and they all greeted the owner by name so I guess they are regulars. Another thing I noticed was that a customer that came in and ordered 15mins after me received her order before me so I don't know if she received special treatment because she's a regular or that my pizza just took longer to cook lol. . The pizza here have always been perfectly cooked and the crust crispy and this time it was no different. The wings on the other hand were disappointing and lacking. They were on the smaller end and for a couple dollars more, I would rather get wings at All Stars.  . Whenever I have a pizza craving, I'll come back.","Great food, great vibe. Had cheese pizza, risotto with spinach, chilis, and sweet potato, and amazing sangria. We went during the day, and the vibe was very laid back and comfortable for all (my husband and I went with our 2 and 6 yr old, and met up with other family members, adults and kids, and we all had a blast). Walked by later that night and clearly this is the place to be. Will be returning as soon as I come back to town.","California Dreamin pizza and meatball calzone were fresh and perfectly baked. Loved the fried dough with powdered and cinnamon sugar. Service was wonderful. Both the girls working were polite and helpful.","Good thin crust pizza. We had the Dough Knots as an appetizer, the 10-inch Popeye Pie for dinner and took home a slice of the Italian Creme Cake. Can't complain -- all was tasty. Best part? The price. The cake was somewhat of a splurge ($6. 50, but the slice is huge) - otherwise, it would have been a $12 dinner for two. . We'll be back to try more pizzas. . We were there early for dinner on a Wednesday and it was not crowded (not shocking. . . ). Our order was taken at a table, though several people came in to order to-go and went straight to the counter.","I was amazed by how well the pizza tasted ! My favourite was the goat cheese with sundried tomato &amp; mint. A unique combination which was delicious. The owner was friendly with great customer service. A definitely a must go to!!!","This place is my go-to pizza delivery joint. Ordering via GrubHub, my delivery is consistently on time, accurate, and hot. In the many times I've ordered from Little Nippers I have never had a bad order. . Their pizza is pretty tasty for Pittsburgh standards. Hoagies are on point!. Their prices are really reasonable--they're a great go-to when ordering out!","The best Chicago style pizza in town! Being from the east coast, that should say a lot","We are delivery junkies for this place. I think the large cheese pizza is amazing and we crave it all the time!  I am a huge Metro fan but this place is cheaper and has a lot of heart. The food is so hot when it gets here I always burn my mouth. All the other food I have tried is good but the pizza is the real star. A rare gem in this city!!","Ever have one of those nights where you walk into a place that looks like it's either closed or no good and be totally surprised? That was my experience at Rocco's. This place really looks like a hole in a strip mall. The busy dining space is hard to see when you walk in. You will slowly take in all this place has to offer (a freezer filled with gelatio, ice cream, sauces, desserts; stacks of pasta and canned Italian goods; an amazing menu of pizza, pasta and more. I got their calzone-like item. It was filled with broccoli and very yummy with their Marinara; though I wanted more cheese and garlic in it!  . Can't wait to try more here!","After hearing so many people in the area raving about Folco's I finally decided to try it out. And we were looking for a reception spot for a Baptism - which we let them know when we walked in. I was disappointed about the food. The veal parmigiana was sub-par. Too much sauce, very dry meat which was overcooked. My husband tried a pasta dish which was \"ok\" we were told pasta was made fresh in house. The drenching of sauce on the pasta killed any taste I was hoping to get out of it. The caesar salad was good &amp; so was the bruschetta. Their tomato sauce - homemade I was told - tastes like something out of a jar. I was hugely disappointed and felt their food tasted no different than the Italian restaurant across the street. I was hoping to go back &amp; try out their pizzas, but there is a much better Italian restaurant in the Garden Basket Plaza that makes everything from scratch and I have been a regular of theirs since they opened.","Nellos is one of our regular, weekly, great dining spots. . . close to south Tempe and Tukee!  We love the atmosphere, the staff/team are helpful &amp; friendly. . . we have our normal go to meal (salad &amp; pepperoni pizza original crust) but . Everything else is great!  Try the meatballs and shrimp appetizers!  There are great wine and beer selections too!  Nellos is worth the trip!","1st time here, Sally at the bar tended us, ordered chicken skewers, mixed &amp; match baskets, house salad. Ordered a pizza with Pepperoni and mushrooms, received a pizza with mushrooms, pepperoni and sausage. Sally caught the snafu promptly and the manager Shelby came and fixed the situation by offering us a free pizza for a future visit. Knives, forks and wet naps were given to us prior to eating which is a plus. Bar was clean, lighting was dimly low but that is ok because the location was at maybe 7% capacity. Pizza is thin crust, you save $1 by ordering a whole pizza as opposed to a whole pizza by the slice. Enjoy! Bon apatite!","It's a great neighbor place. The pizza is great. The salads are airways fresh and the chicken fingers are delicious! Always friendly and fast service.","Good prices. . Good NY pizza. . Fast. . Good selection of slices with cool toppings. . Easy to stop in if you're walking on Fremont. . Bottom line: don't drive across town for this one, but it's a good stop if you're on foot in the area.","I had heard so much about this place I expected five star food but not this night. Our small sausage pizza was over cooked and terrible. My meatball sub, which I normally judge a place by, had a great bun, nice meatballs and cheese but was dry and totally tasteless. It's the sauce that makes the difference and it just had no pizzaz. I hate to say it but subway has a better sauce than what I got here. In hindsight I should have asked for a cup of sauce on the side to dip it in. I do like them sloppy so that might have made the difference. Our other diners had a 16 inch pizza that was perfectly cooked and very good so the place can do it but apparently not every time. The deserts were fabulous so be sure to look at that menu. Last, a little pet peeve of mine, our server, who was very good, needs to stop asking\"how is that tasting \" everytime  she walked by our table. It got annoying after about the third time. So, its is a cool little place and was busy and cosy but on this night I was not impressed and would not rush to return.","The thin crust pizza here is the best I've had in the valley. The thick or deep dish is just okay it doesn't really do it for me to say the least. But boy are the flavors there when you order the thin crust. We always used to come here on Tuesdays to get the Tuesday take out special which apparently stopped. When we called today to go get the usual Tuesday deal to us the dead give away was when the man over the phone had asked us what kind of large soda we would like and when my boyfriend had asked if he meant to say 2 liter he said no. So now that they have taken away my Tuesday special I can tell you at this moment that the chances of us going to nellos after this are slim to none. . I'm severely disappointed that they have no specials anymore but nothing lasts forever I guess. I will miss you nellos very much I will but I guess we will be sticking closer to home and trying out pizza on 87. . . . sigh. . . . :(","The 10\" Margherta pizza smelled fresh and yummy and the 4pc Chicken mix was also very tasty, but the chicken was a pinch salty but still juicy. The garlic bread and wedges that came with the chicken mix was pretty good. Some of the garlic bread was bit tough but still has a good flavor. The wedges are nicely flavored and crispy. Was a bit pricey but sort of worth it. Overall I give it a 8 1/2 out of 10.","The best pizza that I have found so far in Las Vegas!  The stromboli's are good, tha anti pasta is great, etc. Love this small walk up with a few tables for sitting. The best part though (as it should be) is the pizza!","AMAZING savory pies!!!  The green chili gringo hand pie is RIDICULOUS.  Perfect flakey crust, just the right amount of filling of Pork Green Chili, Eggs, Potatoes and Cheddar- great on the go breakfast!  I also tried the 5\" Pork Green Chili POT PIE, which of course was wonderful. We need one more pizza and/or desert shop across the street and we can officially call this stretch of Coronado bordering 7th street: THE PIE DISTRICT.","If I had to rate this place on pizza alone, this review would be a lot different. . First of all, I have had a $5 off an order of $20 or more coupon for. . well, I can't even tell you how long. Every time I call to place an order, they give me some new bs excuse as to why I can't use my coupon. (\"Oh, we already ran your card\" which, well, why the fuccccccc would you do that? And I'm sure if I wanted to add something to my order, that would be justtttt fine. Or \"Well, the you can't use that with the family deal, \" in which case, why the heck isn't that written on the coupon? That's really something that should be in the fine print. ). Then tonight, my family in from out of state decides on pizza and wings. . . and regardless of the stupidity of their employees (\"Well, the family deal DOES come with two two liters, \" \"UH, no it doesn't. . . it comes with one. . . \" \"WELLL I am looking at it right here and it says TWO liters. \" REALLY? YES. ONE BOTTLE IS TWO LITERS. DERRRRRRP. ) their pizza happens to be some of my fave. So we order pizza and wings, and we ask for medium wings with EXTRA wing hot sauce on the side. Instead, we get a vat of ranch and wings that are dryer than Betty White's. . . . well, yanno.","Excellent pizza -- the best delivery I've had. Tasty and not too greasy. . LOVE the restaurant's emphasis on sustainability -- they use local ingredients and have a lot of environmentally sustainable business practices. . Fantastic pizza and socially conscious -- we just found our new go-to pizza place.","It may be little. . . . but this market has punch!. A cupcake truck (salted caramel cupcake, mmm), pizza oven truck, crepe truck. . . . spices, fresh fruits and veggies, the world's most fragrant popcorn, cheese, plenty of meat options (bison bratwurst?!). . . . I have to say my expectations have been exceeded. . Add in the fact that a number of great restaurants/ bars/ coffee shops are within walking distance, and just found yourself a lovely Tuesday afternoon.","The pizza is good, a little limited in variety, but that is the traditional thing, I guess. Does not feel very welcoming or comfortable to sit in but we often enjoy the take out.","Great location . Very nice inside as well as outside. . The pizzas and pasta were superb. . Great service and nice atmosphere.","Decent atmosphere, definitely a neighborhood family-oriented restaurant- it is always very loud and hectic in here. I have eaten at Gates and Brovi about 5-6 times now, and never been particularly impressed with anything beyond apps and burgers. I like their wines by the glass, and it's an okay happy hour option, but the entrees I've tried tend to be bland and not very filling for the price. Plus the service is pretty hit or miss. I haven't had their pizza (gluten sensitivity) but my friends like the pizza there better than the rest of the menu.","Poor service. Terrible food. Soggy and undercooked, no understanding of the problem. . Took 30 minutes to get an undercooked pizza. Had our money refunded the food was so terrible.","Just left and it was my second visit. I really love everything I've ordered so far! The butter pecan shake is to DIE for. You get pecans in every sip, it's amazing. I am not a soda drinker at all but I LOVE the tractor soda and I wish there was somewhere I could purchase it! The only thing I didn't like today was how long everything took. It already took us 45 minutes to drive there, another 30+ minutes of waiting to order and 30+ to get out food. Our food also came out all separate. We got our milkshake first, 10 minutes later my bf got his burger and 15. minutes later I got my pizza.","Lovely little place off the beaten path, yet walking distance from everything. Cozy ambiance both inside and on the patio. The prosciutto and mushroom pizza was delicious-thin and crispy crust cooked perfectly, not burned. I would definitely eat here again on my next visit to Toronto!","We planned a casual wedding rehearsal dinner at Streets of New York, near the site of the wedding. We live 600 miles away, so I had to make all plans by phone/email. The restaurant and its manager were great! The tables were set up and we were ready to go as soon as the wedding party arrived. All I did was embellish the tables a bit with some sparkly confetti, and it looked festive and inviting. The presentation was great, and so was the food! We had  crisp, fresh green salads and wonderful breadsticks. We ate a delicious baked ziti pasta, along with a number of outstanding regular-crust pizzas. We loved the Mediterranean pizza! We also had the New York, meat-eaters, vegetarian, Hawaiian, and a special one with pesto, feta, and sliced tomatoes. Each one was great! We ate our fill and had plenty left to save and munch on later. The service was superlative. I highly recommend Streets of New York on East Germann Rd. as a great place to get together with friends to enjoy some terrific food!","This is based on a take out experience, so please do not expect to dine in there and have me stand by my review :). We were looking for a new pizza place to try near our house on a lazy Sunday. Given that some seem closed on Sundays, we decided to look up Fazio's as I had in my bookmarks. Although it said it was closed here on Yelp (I did send a message with the hours for it to be corrected), we continued to look at the menu that it had a link to. It said they were open so we called in our order. . Large cheese pizza and 1/2 chicken parm hoagie to go (we did not want to commit to a whole after a few bad experiences elsewhere). We wish that we ended up getting a whole though, that is for sure. The pizza was thinner, not too heavy crust wise, there was ample cheese (by ample, I mean a lot), and the sauce was great IMO.  The chicken parm hoagie was crispy, not mushy, and absolutely awesome!  Everything was awesome. . . and we will definitely be ordering from there again. My husband said that they were extremely nice in there too.  . Cannot wait to go back!","Considering this restaurant is located directly below my office, I've never partaken in a meal here until the other day. Literally, I was a \"kid in a candy store\" and was amazed by their setup here. Almost cafeteria-esq style, you walk in, get greeted by the hostess/greeter person and he/she will give you a plastic card. Depending on what you would like to eat for that meal, you walk up to the counter and order. Place your card on the \"magic\" slot device and the put the item you are about to receive on it and you pay the cashier on the way out. Kinda genius if you think about it. Less waiters (they still bus the tables for you) and the tables are first come-first serve. . I think my favorite part of this place is that they make their pasta in-house. Even have a room dedicated to it. During my lunch, I totally watched a guy make pasta from scratch and then put it through a machine. Rotini was being made at that particular time. . I ordered from the pasta station and the chef?/line cook was super nice. I think he could tell I was a newbie, and was patient with me. Deciding on the Smoked Salmon Carbonera. . . the started making my lunch right in front of me. In about 7-8 min. . . I had a delicious, steaming bowl of pasta presented before me. My buddy had a salad which involved a beeper (so will have to try that next time). And their pizza's look pretty awesome too. . The restaurant space itself is modern with clean lines, but warm woods and decorated with small herb plants. Each table has its own oil, salt, pepper, balsamic. I tried to take it easy on the bread, but it was too hard to resist.","Girlfriend took me here for my birthday. Awesome pizza. A little pricey but well worth it.","Love it. Owners are from West Babylon, NY. They had a pizza shop and Italian bakery in Islip Terrace NY right down the street from where I grew up. I could not believe they lived here for so long and I was unaware. Garlic Knots are great and the pizza is good NY style. The family were all in tonight and visited our table when they heard we were from East Islip. Uncle Joe is such a nice man. The entire evening was just delightful. I am happy to discover this little gem of a place and I will be back. Happy to say they opened a Beall's outlet right next door too so I can shop and eat. Well, at least until they move to their new location.","I had dinner at Humble Pie in Scottsdale last night, the bar tender Marcus was very polite, had great recommendations which were awesome and has a great personality! The bar has a great set up, had it been a little warmer I would've sat at the outside bar. . They did have heaters but inside was just as nice. I had the huge wedge salad, the lettuce was crispy, all veggies were fresh but the only ingredient missing was BACON! Shame on you, Humble Pie! I also had the margherita pizza only because I had to try a pie! This is a must try and enough for two, maybe 3 if you have starters. . No need to over stuff yourself! If I have another chance to come back while in Scottsdale, I definitely will!","The sports deli at the Rio is our go to place for a quick snack or late night munchies. The food is served fairly quickly and everyone is friendly. The sandwiches are HUGE. I had the nachos this time, they were just ok, but a decent portion. The pizza is average. I really like the wings, you can order the sauce on the side and just have them crispy. The only negative is the price, it is quite expensive - oh well.","The Good:  Great, friendly service with a smile and laid back atmosphere. . The Bad:  The crust was not all that I thought it would be. Instead of being dense and buttery, it was really light and fluffy. Not what I was expecting from a deep dish crust. Normally eating 1 or 2 slices of Chicago deep dish is enough to make you throw in the towel but I ate 4 slices and ehh, not so much stuffed. The sauce was awesome however. . The Ugly:  Spinach on pizza was undercooked and slimy. Probably just a fluke this time but still off-putting. If you are looking to listen to loud tv's and drink, go to Native New Yorker. Several people found this out the hard way that they can't turn the volume up louder after ordering 5 pitchers of beer, only to give it away for free to people sitting behind them so they could leave for Native.","The pizza taste just like pizza in  New York . It has a thin crust  and they cook it in the brick oven. The sauce is so full of flavor. It is hard to find good pizza anywhere outside of New York but this is the best I have had so far. . Im craving it right know. I usually get the pepperoni or add hot peppers to it. .","The Original is an iconic restaurant in Pittsburgh that has started to rest on its laurels. They know people will come here and fork over their money so they can say they ate at \"The Dirty O. \". The Original has been around forever--my father-in-law would eat there in the '60s when he was a student at Pitt. The hot dogs are fine, the burgers are fine, the pizza is fine. There is nothing overly mind-blowing about the place. . Oh, and the sauerkraut was COLD. A definite turn off in my book. . The fries are good, but I didn't find anything all that special about them. The employees do their jobs, but don't expect an exciting interaction with them. . Quite honestly, the best thing about the Original is the upstairs seating area. It's quiet and doesn't smell like grease. AND it has great views of the public milling around the area. . As a Detroiter who has consumed coney dogs her entire life, I can say that The Original has nothing on the hot dog shops of Detroit. Skip the Original. It's not even worth saying, \"I've eaten there!\"","Second Sunday we've ordered from here. After moving into the Waterford apartments we'd been trying to find good delivery and I think we find it! The delivery service is amazing. Can't get over how nice the delivery man was. Best service I've ever had. And the margarita pizza was beautiful just as he said. We're definitely making this our new Sunday pizza place! Thanks so much!!","Duck poutine pizza. Of course, that is what everyone is talking about. I'm still thinking about it the next day. It's one of those dishes that is perfect for the great white north. The kind of food you need to fatten up before the great hibernation. If bears could, they would order the duck poutine pizza before they slept for the winter. And after a lunch of this pizza I needed a nap. It's definitely worth a trip to Bannock to eat this deliciousness especially if you need to bulk up for a long cold winter.","I went here for my birthday after hearing about it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and it is very delicious. I love the food here, especially the Southwest burger and grilled pizzas. Not to mention the atmosphere is family-friendly and carries a good vibe. I plan on returning there again for my next birthday lunch!","Nice patio in the back with lots of afternoon sun. The pizzas are very good, and they've got a rotating list of daily specials which are reliable. . I ordered a perrier to drink and the waiter brought over a huge bottle for the table, cracked it open, and poured before I could say I just wanted a glass. Not a huge deal, but I didn't like the assumption that I wanted the biggest size they offered. . . and sometimes that's all it takes to annoy you for the rest of a meal. . Sandwiches are huge! Probably the best Italian sandwiches in the area (although 2x the price of most places).","The atmosphere is gorgeous and I loved the garden just wished I had come during the day to check it all out. Unfortunately the food is a bit bland. We order zucchini chips, a Sonoran dog and the bbq chicken pizza. The zucchini chips were the best item we ordered but just okay. We will go back and try it again during the day maybe for breakfast. Cute place but the food was disappointing.","We had our food delivered, it was delivered much sooner than expected. We had the Italian sub, fried mushrooms, philly style fries, and the ultimate pizza. Everything was delicious, the pizza was not skimpy on toppings at all, the sub was perfect and much bigger than expected, I'm really picky with fried mushrooms and am typically disappointed at most restaurants but these were the best I have ever had. Will definitely be returning in the future!","I am visiting Calgary and this has become my new hang out spot. The hookah is of excellent quality and very affordable. The flavors available are great. The ambiance of is very nice and relaxing. At night they play music and it is always of great taste. Another fantastic thing is the food. We ordered a pizza and it was beyond amazing. The crust was perfect and the cheese and the toppings. It was such a great pizza that we have to definitely get it again before I leave. This was a top 5 must go to place for me while visiting.","The appearance and customer service are great, but as a native Chicagoan I gotta say that I was disappointed with the pizza. Perhaps its because I ordered a simple pepperoni, but it definitely NOT Chicago-style pizza. If you are a native Chicagoan, don't waste your time.","Do you know how difficult it is to make a 5-star Hawaiian pizza? Maybe you don't like Hawaiian pizza, maybe you don't care. But as a lover of Hawaiian pizza I can tell you that is very easy to make a 3-star Hawaiian pizza and exceedingly difficult to make a 5-star Hawaiian pizza. The one here is it. . The dough was perfectly cooked and the tomato sauce was delicious. I assume this applies to all of their pizza too. But the pineapples were the perfect size of chunks, plentiful, and did not soak through the dough. The ham was not thin slices or cold cut ham; but rather thick chunks of cured pork. Add to that a dash of the chilli-olive oil that they bring to the table, and you've basically got the perfect Hawaiian pizza. My dad had a different pizza with chicken and it also looked awesome (he said he loved it though I did not try it). . For dessert I had the tiramisu, and I cannot complain - clearly homemade, terrific balance of sweet and coffee flavouring. . Piola is near queen and dufferin, a bit far from the downtown core. I will be back; It is worth the trip!","Great pizza at a small price. Tonys is one restraunt in boulder city that really has good value with a great product. Real pizza here. The slices are awesome also. .","Well what can i say about Rocky's. Its one of the few Pizza places i like to eat from and im not a real Pizza lover. . Pizza is nice thin crunchy crust with an amazing sauce. . First time i ate there i ordered a pepporoni slice, and thats where it all started. . After that we ordered a full pizza, my wifey was in pizza heaven (major pizza lover) it was delicious, didnt complain one bit. . Tried one of there baked subs and it was tasty too. (Meatball Sub). Wings were great too, nice and spicy and very good. . Only thing is they dont have fountain drinks, they sell soda by the can, tea, gatorade, water and are not open that late. . All n all it was good.","Ya just can't beat a 50% off deal! While the appeal of free food brought us in the door, it did get these guys on our radar. Up until recently, we had no idea they were right around the corner given their prime real estate (sarcasm). . I generally liked as many things as I disliked here. The owners and staff are very friendly, but the location and the interior are pretty lack luster. The parking lot can be a real pain to maneuver through if it's crowded, or if Old Statesville has a good bit of traffic- which it usually does. Interior is a bit tight. . The food is another 50/50. The grinders are good. Pizza? Meh, definitely had better. . My top negative would be pricing. This definitely isn't your top notch \"NY style\" and you pay $$$ for it. Comparing the pizza quality, I'd say it resembles a CiCi's. Comparing the pizza pricing, I'd say a large, true NY style (just up the road, given) is the same price as a small \"NY style\" here. . So again, you can expect pretty great customer service and real decent grinders here (and maybe other menu items too). Haven't tried their buffet either, so that might be cool. . Personally, it's just hard to justify their pricing. Will be looking out for the coupons!","Very disappointing. . . And here is why. . . . 1) $16 cab ride from Encore, which is already on the north end of the strip. 2) neighborhood itself is very seedy and impossible to get a cab AFTERWARDS. Ended up going to a gas station and a local pizza delivery guy gave us a ride. (Note: order from Prima Pizza!!). 3) bartenders and cocktail waitresses were both yawning multiple times! It was only midnight. Not a great tone to set for patrons. . 4) I asked for a Moscow Mule and they were 'out of' ginger beer. What kind of speakeasy doesn't have ginger beer. . 5) I settled for their 'House Speciality' drink the 'Expressionist', which was okay, but the bartender didn't even know the ingredients so she had a reference her cheat sheet. Lame. . 6) I asked for a Kir Royal for my wife. A very basic and simple drink but bartender said she didn't know what it was and made no effort to ask. . 7) $14 per drink for all of the above is a joke. . Ended up costing $16+$31+7 (tip for pizza guy)= $53 for two mediocre cocktails. . Won't be back.","There aren't a lot of places in the Montreal region you can get your hands on some great authentic Napoletan pizza. This place is a regular for my wife and I. . I won't go into all the details but the Pizzas are great. Thin crust, focus on the quality of the ingredients. Fresh and tasty. . Quebecois beware. There aren't handfuls of toppings, the Quebecois couple we invited with us once were shocked to have been deprived their usual bucket of toppings that dilutes the taste of a well done wood oven cooked pizza. . The arancini balls are very very good. . Their Nutella Pizza is a favorite of ours too. . Service is quick and friendly. . My highlights are when the owner passes by and says hello and I get to converse some of my rusty Napoletan. :)","Visited this place on November 19th 2016, which is National Adoption Day, and the service was horrible. The cashier that helped me was okay, but i got her to open up and become more customer friendly. We had roughly 20 people with us as an adoption was finalized and we went there to celebrate. As we had been sitting there possibly 15 to 20 minutes, a woman is all black with dyed blond hair came and placed reserved signs on the tables we we occupied and told us that we didn't have to move just yet. At that time it was 1:40 pm and the reservation was for 2 pm and we haven't even received our food at the time. The food came out sporadically as we'd get chicken wings, then bread-sticks and pizza last. This place is going downhill and could be saved if the employees were more courteous to the customers as this is a consumer based business.","I got my order to go. My veggie pie was ready when I arrived. The price was very reasonable. The place was clean, had a fresh and trendy appearance, and outside seating if desired. . I came here because they have a vegan pizza that is made with hummus instead of fake cheese! I thought this was so awesome, but you can see from the picture that the hummus is just mainly piled on top in the middle instead of spread uniformly over the pizza as a base. So basically you eat the pizza with veggies on it, and then take a spoon to the center to get the hummus. All of the ingredients tasted good despite the awkward assembly. . Service was bland. . . Not rude. . . But never smiled. . Regardless, I give this place a thumbs up because it offers real vegan pizza!","Went here with the office for our annual party and I expected decent food. We went with the party menu which was set with shared apps and a choice of 4 different mains. . From the time we sat down, our server at the bar appeared frazzled and took forever to get drinks set, made and served. I tried the Italian Greyhound for my first drink, not only did it take 30 minutes to get to me, it came with 4 extra fruit flies on it. . I twitted about it and was asked to DM so that they could speak to the management about it. . After about an hour or so of waiting for all of our coworkers to get there, we then headed downstairs into the private room which I have to say have one of the coolest decor/ambiance I have been in. . They started to serve the Palenta fries which was shared between everyone. It was alright, bland and the marinara dip tasted like something you could get from Loblaws. . The second starter they served was the pizza. The crust was good, but if you eat the pizza with the toppings you will be met with the saltiest things ever. So. . . needless to stay, I just ate the crust. . The third starter was a platter of mini meatballs, tiger shrimps and the risotto balls which was basically an upscale cafeteria food.  . For an Italian place, the meatballs tasted like a frozen dinner meatloaf rolled up into little balls.  . Next served was the salad and the tomato and cheese appetizer. These 2 I believe was the only ones I was able to eat with no problem although I think the salt that tomato/cheese app needed all was put into the Pizza. . The mixed mushroom appetizer came next and was ok. It seemed fresh and was nice. . For the main, I chose the Fettucine, which came with Shrimps, pesto, mascarpone cheese and a touch of tomato sauce. . I won't hold back on my review because honestly, for an upscale place, I was hoping to be blown away. The pasta was WAY overdone, there was a mixture of frozen package shrimps and the tiger shrimps so the cook on both were totally off. I think that I would have had a better tasting pasta from the cooked food section of a Loblaws. I could not, for the love of God eat more than a bite full of this \"italian pasta\". . The Chef's selection of deserts however was good. I think aside from the deserts, decor and the people I was with, nothing else was good.  . At the end of the night, I had to go grab dinner at Sushi Inn just so that I could have a proper Dinner. . Unfortunately, coming here with expectations and only being underwhelmed was a very big disappointment to me and my friends. I would hope that in the future, they taste their food prior to serving them to their patrons. . Food Score:. Palenta Fries: 2/5. Pizza: 0. 5/5. Polpettine/Mini Meatballs: 0/5. Arancini/Risotto Balls: 1/5. Shrimp Diavola: 2/5. Salad: 3/5. Caprese/Cheese&amp;mozarella: 2/5. Funghi/Mushrooms: 3/5. Fettucine: 0/5","I would give this spot 10 stars if I could. This is as close as it gets to real Italian pizza, which I have eaten plenty of in Italy. That means, great crust, and no \"American\" tomato sauce, but rather a good fresh, ground, uncooked tomato sauce that gets cooked in the oven. The pepperoni is not like you get in the US. It is sausage resembling more of a home made pepperoni with strong pork flavor. The mozzarella cheese is made fresh and the parmesan is real, no fillers. Salads are generous and very tasty with a simple dressing. The owner and staff are very on point to make sure you know what you are getting and do a fantastic job at making you comfortable. The only downside I experienced was that the glass of wine is small. I don't know what their pour is but it is the only thing not generously given. Not served in a traditional stemmed glass, it was more like a small 1/2 full glass of fruit juice. But I went for the pizza, not the wine. Also, short wait time. The pizza bakes in 90 seconds once it is in the oven. Novanta means 90.","Monroe's is a cool little basement bar in downtown Phoenix. Just by existing, it creates a sense that Downtown Phoenix isn't just a pathetic excuse for a city that was simply plopped on top of the desert. It gives the area character. It's one of those places that help make downtown feel more like a much cooler city that has an abundance of stuff like this. . You blink and you might miss it, but once you find the door and descend the stairway you'll find yourself inside a dark and cozy spot lined with old woods and bookended by a wrap-around bar and a stage where they sometimes have musicians play. The atmosphere is pretty inviting, but it helps if you bring a buddy so you don't feel like an outcast. . There are tables and chairs to sit at and the place is capable of accomidating groups. They serve food as well of course and the food is good. I've had pizza there and I thought it was quite tasty. Nothing to write home about, but I'll yelp about it. . It's the sort of place that sets the scene for \"anything can happen\" night. . . sorta like Chez Nous did, but in a different way. Definitely worth the trip. . edit: I went here last year, and I've learned it may be closed now (although a search on the web turns up nothing about closure). . . definitely needs confirmation.","We have been here a number of times and I really like the food and beer selection but the service, frankly, sucks. If I could look past the service this would be a 4, maybe even 5 star review, but again the service consistently sucks. . Let's review the service first and just get this out of the way. Tonight we came in and it was moderately busy so we sat/stood at the bar. We all ordered beers (at least 3 on their draught list were kicked but still on the chalk board. How hard is it to erase a chalk board?) and our friends ordered a pizza. The wait wasn't long for the pizza but when the kitchen brought out the pizza they just set it on the back bar. And there it sat for 10 minutes while the bar tender and servers walked by it and wouldn't make eye contact with us. Finally my friends were served their lukewarm pizza after we pointing out that it was there. No apologies or acknowledgment of an issue were given. When it started to clearing out we moved to a table and had some more beers. At the end of the night a friend had to leave early so he cashed out his tab. After our friend had left the bartender came over and stated that he had given our tab to my friend whom had left so we would need to pay his which was much larger. He stated that we could just get the money back from our friend for the difference later on. Once again no real apology was given. I am really not sure how his mental error became my problem but it seems kind of ridiculous that I became responsible for it and it isn't like there is a manager on duty to deal with. . Onto the good stuff. The pizza is well above average and my wife especially loves the buffalo chicken pizza. The wings are some of the best in town. Fried crisp and sauced properly. The beer list is also one of the best in the east end. They boast around 20 taps and the selection is always unique and well rounded for even the most demanding beer guy or girl. . Bottom line, I'll come back. But I know that service will probably continue to suck and that I really have to be proactive as a customer when I am there.","The dining commons excels in offering an impressive array of desserts, beverages, and salad bar options but could use a boost to its main entree selections. Here's my beef with the DC: there's a sandwich station that boasted a menu with a pesto caprese option. Being that I love caprese (and it was the only vegetarian option), it was the logical choice to go caprese. Come to find out, the \"pesto\" is actually pesto mayo and there is no basil on the sandwich! You simply cannot omit basil from caprese. It's one of the main goddamn ingredients! I made do with lettuce instead, and my sad faux caprese ended being okay for a light lunch snack. . Besides the salad bar and the sandwich station, there's a pizza and pasta bar and what looked like a Chinese food section. I grabbed some fries that were set up to a hot dog station to finish up my main course. . Dessert is where it's at! There was brownies, cupcakes, cookies, and a Dryer's ice cream machine complete with chocolate sprinkles waiting to be scooped up. The brownies and ice cream were yummy. Beverages available include a Nestle hot chocolate machine, coffee, soda, juice, and lemon water to name a few. I was super impressed that they had chocolate and vanilla soymilk on standby!. When you're all done eating, there's a conveyor belt where students drop off all their dishes. I'd compare the quality of the food at the dining commons to EDR food or any other cafeteria type place. Most things are just okay, but there are a few standouts. My lunch date got a turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce and stuffing, and she absolutely loved her food. . YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #254","Pizza is pretty good here. Came in for a pizza at lunchtime place was pretty dead so didn't wait to long. The beer was ice cold. Will come back for sure. If you haven't been here it's worth the trip.","Great pizza place. This is the type of restaurant that is typically found downtown Pittsburgh. We had the pork wings which had a smokey sweet BBQ sauce. They were amazing. The pizza was around 12 inches and was about medium/thin thickness. It is pricey and I highly recommend going during happy hour to save some money. Which reminds me, the beer selection was eclectic and I enjoyed some beers that I wasn't familiar with. Absolutely recommend coming here.","best pizza in the area by far. one of the best i've ever had. the seafood pizza is absolutely amazing. great service and they go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied.  so for everyone who said they had an unpleasent experience next time open your mouth and say something or don't complain. unfortunately we know people who have avoided the restaurant because of some of the reviews people have written.  if you don't like the pizza then that's your opinion.  i understand but i eat there quite often and have never had a bad experience . i have never talked to anyone who has either.  for those of you who are wondering no i am not th owner but i am one of his best customers i bet. the only reason i am giving them 5 stars is because it wont let me give them 6. to the management of fat bobs keep up the great work and for god sakes don't change the sea food pizza.","The pizza was really good!. They have interesting combinations but everything is really testing. I've been here 3 night in a row. . I recommend this","Holy Meatza Pizza !!! We ordered the Guys XL Meatza Pizza last night with the thin crust and it was ridiculously delicious. The toppings were full of flavor and loaded on to edges. The thin crust was not as crunchy as I prefer, but the meat stacked upon this beast of a pizza made up for it. So the XL pizza is freakishly large. I ordered it with hopes of having leftovers, but I never would have thought it would be enough for several days worth! . Delivery was a bit slower than ideal, but they were upfront about the timing. I would definitely give this place a chance if you are looking for a slice of good ol' fashioned greasy goodness.","A place with only French Fries and Ice Cream - what a divine idea!  It's easy to find gourmet ice cream parlors, but gourmet french fries are a new treat!  . I recently visited and was immediately struck by the ambience of the inside. Although the restaurant is enclosed, it has high ceilings and a pickup window which helped give it a vibe of being outside, particularly close to a fun beach location. Whether it's the thought of gourmet french fries and ice cream that helped fuel the \"vacation\" vibe, I definitely got a nice break from reality when I walked in.  . I ordered the pizza fries with pepperoni and man were they yummy!  Crispy hand-cut fries seasoned with fresh herbs, perfectly melted cheese and topped with baby pepperonis, all with marinara sauce for dipping. It was amazing!  I don't know why more pizza restaurants don't convert to serving pizza this way, it was a really inspired!  . This place warrants a visit, whether you order or just enjoy the ambience and drool over the menu while you're there. No matter your tastes, sweet or savory, Sweetie Fry has something you will enjoy!","absolute garbage. 0 stars. flies crawling all over the slices. smells gross. pizza barely had any tomato sauce. pepperonis were like the ones from a lunchable. cheese is plastic crap. I'm royally PISSED off &amp; papa ceo would be too!!!!!! gross!","We ordered a pizza for delivery, and waited 2 and a half hours with no delivery. Called and the manager said they overlooked the order, we asked for a full refund and they gave us $10 off. Delivery guy finally showed up and we had already ordered chinese. Horrible customer service. If the pizza is over 2 hours late, give it for free. Better yet, NEVER order from a pizza place that takes 2 hours to deliver!!!","Spent the weekend at the Trump Hotel in Vegas across the street from the Fashion Show Mall. While in the mall I noticed Grimaldi's Pizzeria. A sign in front said it was voted best pizza by the Food Network. Not sure if that's true, but that's what it said. . I couldn't wait to try it out, so I ordered a pizza to take back to the hotel room. Boy, was I underwelmed. Not even close to the best pizza I ever had. I think I should stay open-minded about this and maybe visit another location. But at this point, it wouldn't even make my top twenty list. I do have to say the service was good. The bartender who took my order was very busy, but still took the time to walk back to the kitchen to check on my order.","My deliverer was fast and nice. This is my go to place when I was some garlic breaded pizza.","i've gone to bottega twice, the first time it was \"ok\", the second time it was terrible. i don't understand what the hype is, i love good pizza. i've had amazing pizza in rome, venice, boston, and nyc. i have to find great thin crust brick oven pizza in montreal and when i heard about bottega i thought \"this is it! finally good pizza in montreal!\" but alas, not to be. i judge a pizzeria by their margherita, if you can't make a good margherita pizza then whats the point. the first time my pizza had no cheese, and i mean maybe 20% coverage. . i would say a good thin crust pizza should have about 50% cheese coverage, a few nice pieces of fresh mozarella. the second time i come i ask for a little extra cheese to compensate for last time, and what i got was barely edible. it was as if the cheese and sauce had fused into this pink watery slime. the crust was soaked. it was one of the worst pizzas i've ever eaten. . maybe i need to give them another shot, but at what point do you stop giving a restaurant chances to get even the most basic things right? i don't recall the sauce being anything remarkable either.","Loved this place! Went for lunch. And had the Bianca with sausage. The pizza came out really quickly and was hot. Loved that they have not only grated parm and pepper flakes, but also hot oil. I also asked for a side of sauce (my pizza didn't have it on it) and they brought some with no problem. The space is bright and really welcoming, and the people are friendly. Will definitely be back!","The idea behind this place is great. It screams nostalgia for any gamer while providing really good pizza. The pepperoni pizza was delicious. The crust was cooked to perfection and the cheese was gooey and melted. They carry a variety of canned sodas, my personal favorites including Grape soda and Vanilla Dr. Pepper! Being able to play video games while you wait for your order is what makes this place so unique. Each table against the wall has at least one system hooked up varying from NES to the Wii U and PS3! Overall great place. 4 stars instead of 5 because of location size. It could be so much more if moved to a larger location. But, start small and grow Super Pizza Bros.","Excellent food! Great staff! All around a great experience. It's hidden in a strip mall attached to a gas station. Who on earth would think this would have been one of my favorite pizza joints in the country? The flavors were amazing. Had the Guido and Zen Garden. I loved them both. I'll defiantly be back. Go try it, you'll love it.","Cool ambiance. Completely overpriced menu with mediocre food. Lobster pot pie was over baked and tasted like a frozen one. Sea bass was cooked nicely, but the rest of that entree was soupy and unappealing. . Flatbread pizza was good, although a bit pricey.  . The wine by the glass options were extremely limited. . I expected more.","Parents took me here while I was home for Labor Day. We walked right in on a Saturday evening, no wait. Place is nice and open inside, especially on a nice day with the patio open. . We got a large pizza with mushrooms and sweet peppers and an order of their wings. I was intrigued by the wings because there isn't a vast list of flavors like other wing joints--just their blend. I was a bit skeptical when my dad told me they come covered in saut\u00e9ed onions, but wow were they good. Seasoned perfectly with their special blend of spices and the onion flavor seeped in. Tasted like a chicken wing should, not trying too hard to mask the actual taste. I wish I had taken a picture so you could see the onion pile, which we ate on the pita bread that came with It (my dad also added some to his pizza when it came. ). The pizza was also quite good. I loved the mushrooms because they were cooked differently than the normal soggy type that shows up on pizza. My only complaint, and I know it's coal oven pizza, is that the edge of our pizza crust was very burnt. The bottom wasn't, but the edge of about half was extremely blackened. I think it needed spun more in the oven while cooking to even it out. But I'd still definitely return, it was even good cold for breakfast leftovers the next day!","Ok so they charge a lot just for a single slice of pizza but what gets me is they charge a lot for what looks like old pizza that they reheat just to give to you which is one messed up and two gross I recommend going to Paris casino and go to La pizza same price but man is it worth it the pizza at that place was amazing definitely worth the walk and and use your money for better food!","Found out about Dino's from a neighborhood post, went with my family for dinner, was not disappointed, food was delicious, had a Caesar salad and a 16 inch pizza , the crust was amazinggggg, so crispy , not something I come across too often living in AZ. . The staff is super friendly, the only thing I will mention is that they are clearly still putting the finishing touches together on the look and presentation, and are not quite all set up, but they are only open for 3 weeks and they haven't had their official grand opening, but I will definitely be back and recommend it to everyone! I mean at the end of the day its the food and service that matters to me and they are a 10 in both!!!","Stopped here for a quick bite before going to dinner. Had a delicious slice of pizza with goat cheese, onions, eggplant and heirloom tomatoes. Pleasant service also and the place was packed with patrons.","Tops is the oddball little neighbourhood dive bar/sports bar that I would be happy to call my local watering hole. . Cont'd below, but first off - As far as pizza goes, Tops are total champions! Super heavy yet not greasy, and loaded the hell up with tasty toppings, Tops does pizza right. We got the New Yorker half and halfed with the Spartan pizza. Steak bites, mushrooms, green pepper, onions and bacon stripes [sic] (actia;;u there were a tonne of spelling mistakes on this menu - @yycist would have a hayday) meets donair meat and banana peppers. It's unruly delicious. It's also close to $40 for an XL (14\"). a Worth it? Yeah, we both had leftovers. . You start getting north and what happens? Unfortunately the bars get further and further away. You'd better hope you live next to a fits-all bar that fits you. Or, you know, you could just live a lifestyle that doesn't involve having a close to home spot where you can drink, eat, and befriend the other drinkin' eatin' locals. . . But I don't even want to entertain that as a possibility. . . . Now I say sports bar/dive bar. On first look, Tops is surprisingly nice, sporting a giant guitar in the roof. On the ground, the bar counters shadow the outline of the giant guitar. Where the fretboard is, is a long bar height table good for conversational seating for up to 8 people. But for some reason I can't help but think that it is merely lipstick on a pig. . . Maybe it was the human feces smeared along and adjacent strip mall glass door, and then piled on the sidewalk below, as I approached Tops. . . Maybe. . But Tops can't be blamed for that, it wasn't even their business! Well, yes it wasn't their business, but can they be blamed? Ehn, I have a feeling that's a different story altogether. . . I don't yet know the denouement.","Sucks!!! Totally sucks!!!! Sucks that I can't change what I get regularly there. So good I get the same thing every time and some how taste better every time! Will keep going back again and again. . Every one needs to go here!. It's subway but with pizza. I'm getting hungry already and about to head over to Custom Built Pizza. . . . . . YUM!","My family and I tried this restaurant for a grad celebration, based on the great reviews on Yelp and it sure delivered! Our party of 4 ordered a few apps to share as well as 3 mains. . The highlights were the antipasto Della Casa, margherita pizza and agnolotti. I also need to mention how delicious the tiramisu was - and I'm a chocolate cake kinda girl!. Service was also phenomenal - we can't wait to return!!","What went wrong is the service. We called for a delivery of 2 pizzas at 19h30 on a tuesday night since the weather was terrible outside, even if we live 10 minutes walk away. An hour later, we receive a call saying that our pizzas were missing with their delivery person. So it's either we wait for the delivery to show up (after already waiting for an hour) or we pick it up ourselves. We were shocked to find this out an hour after our order, when we were specifically told there was a 30 minute wait before getting our pizzas, which we accepted. This is very disapointing for the fact we needed to walk in the terrible weather to pick them up, getting them more than an hour and a half later. . . .","Well had heard from my friend that this was the best Italian in the city.  . I was very excited. It didn't take long after arriving to realise that this wasn't up my alley. Their menu is very weird or uses unusual ingredients.  actually ingredients that not long ago were considered low end. Beef tongue,  lamb brains, beef heart tartare and blood sausage!  Why try and make inferior cuts edible. Are they afraid of competition from the many more competent restaurants? Anyway we ordered the Nordini and some pizza with sausage and dandelions on it. Then we ordered a $95 steak,  it takes an hour to cook and comes basically raw in the middle. Barely brown on the outside. Really under done for me and nothing special to speak of at all. I have had way better and at half the price. The pizza was tasty,  but some of them are as much as $25,  seems crazy to me. . Not a very good meal,  and I certainly won't be going back or sending anyone I know there. Definitely over rated and hyped. There is way better Italian in Toronto than this.","Always searching for a lunch deal - that's me. Luigi's may become my near West side place to go when I am out doing errands and crave some cheezy fresh pizza and a salad. . Lunch special - ANY pizza at 6 inch size with ANY small salad for $8. 99. That is a good deal when the pizza is truly handmade with fresh mozz. . I chose the housemade spicy sausage pizza and the arugula salad. Crust was thin and perfect really. (fyi- I am super picky about pizza crust. ) Sausage was tasty. . The salad was BIG for a small salad; it came with lots of caramelized onions, walnuts and fresh goat cheese. . While a 6 in. pizza would not satisfy my husband - for me it is exactly right for lunch. . Service was very friendly and prompt even though the place was busy at noon with 80% tables full and one large kid party. . Tables have paper covers and crayons- fun!. They were offering some fresh fruit Sangrias - which sounded awesome - must go back and try those!","I am rating this for eat in only. The pizza was awesome!! The loaded fries not so much, it was a very small serving and just bland. We had plenty of drink refills and ate downstairs during a planned event. I gave it a 4 based on the fact that one menu item was great and the other not. I would like to try it again but skipping the fries.","I was here with friends a few weeks back and I must say I was quite impressed by the pizza they serve. They have huge pizza on the display which is quite appetising. . We ordered mushroom pizza and hot lips (I remember pineapple as one of the toppings). Hot lips was quite an amusing name!! They give huge slices of pizza and one slice is like a small pizza you get at regular pizza joints. They are also generous with the toppings they give. One slice is totally worth the price!! I prefer adding extra chilli flakes to my pizza as it adds extra zing to the whole experience of eating a hot slice of pizza. For drinks, I recommend the red ribbon mintt ginger dirnk. Anytime during the day in hot summer, it is my favorite drink. It also goes well with the pizza. . I will go back again and if you are in southside with a bunch of friends or by yourself, you should consider visiting this place for a slice of the huge pizza they serve!!","Went for supper around 7:00pm and the place was about 1/3 full. I've liked the concept that Via Cibo presents, but the details are in the execution. There is a mix of individual and communal tables. The rough hewn wood surfaces add to the \"street food\" atmosphere. . I ordered the specials (mushroom soup &amp; mushroom pizza) and my partner has the pasta primavera and asked for added shrimp. . Soup flavour was good and pizza was good (I love stone fired thin crust) but both specials were listed as having a \"medley of mushrooms\". All I saw were sliced button mushrooms. Further, I'm not a big fan of garnishing a cream based soup with chopped parsley. Leave the parsley for the clear brothed soups. . Our biggest concern was with the added shrimp in the primavera. We don't think they were properly cooked. . Overall a good concept, but if you do go, stick with the tried and true classics.","My boyfriend and I were so excited for this restaurant to open because it's so close to his house! We have been here three different times and were happy each time. I suggest going on Wednesdays for wing night! Their wings are great! We also enjoyed the pizza, the crust is awesome. The meatballs and Cuban sandwich were just okay. . . which is why I chose 4 stars rather than 5. They also have a great beer selection!","I came here after receiving a free pizza at a Yelp event. Upper Crust had some of the best food at the event so I couldn't wait to have dinner at the restaurant.  . My friend and I came here on a Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it was 1/2 off a bottle of wine day. I can't remember exactly which wine we ordered, but it was a Shiraz and it was good. We shared a happy hour appetizer of mild wings and a large pepperoni pizza with basil. It was all so delicious!  . I also came here a different day with my boyfriend and we shared the meatballs with cheese on top and a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and basil. Again, it was very tasty!  . Everyone was very friendly and prompt. I will be back to Upper Crust!","Great place to come watch a game or grab a bite to eat, the bar is divided in 2 sections, one has a TV and tables which I think is great for having a pizza with friends and family during football season and the the other side has the bar, however you can still order food anywhere, although there isn't a server in this place, Trevor (the bartender) did a great job taking care of us. I will definitely be coming back for more.","Seriously, I feel like such a fool for not trying this place sooner. I disregarded it for some hipster spot having a moment, but I was wrong. A pizza place that has mastered crust, that reminds me so much of my favorite NYC spot in the west village. Seriously, give this place a try.","Clean, nicely decorated pizza place. The Margherita is simple and delicious. Ingredients look fresh and the service is friendly. Every time I go it's in the late afternoon so the place is pretty empty and the service is fast. I would like to try the bruschetta. . . have only tried the pizza so far.","I have to say, this may be my favorite wood fired pizza in central Phoenix. . I'll have to try Spasso's pizza a few more times to confirm that my infatuation was not the result of a long week, my chemical composition on that particular day, or the peace of a cold beer, but if future experiences are anything like my first, I am a fan! . The house made mozzarella appetizer is ok. The steak (that my boyfriend ate) was fine. The real star here is the pizza, which had a perfectly chewy crust and the meat combination completed a perfect blend of cheesy saltiness. . The owner was a little overly chatty, but at the same time, how can I blame him when clearly this restaurant is his pet project. The service was GREAT. . . I don't think our water glasses were ever empty. . I have to admit, a small part of my enthusiasm is probably because this restaurant is in Town &amp; Country Mall, which is a terribly under appreciated piece of real estate. . . I'd love to see this good, family-owned restaurant survive.","I came to Buca with some co-workers for a job well done celebration. I'm not a real fan of chain Italian restaurants, but Buca is different with the atmosphere, being able to handle large parties, and if course family-style dining. We were seated in the Pope room which is fun but little freaky. Pictures of the Pope all over with a head of the Pope on the middle of the table and the Pope chair. Strange but cool having the Pope watch you eat. . We started off by having the Mozzarella Garlic bread which was really good, the Chopped Antipasto salad, and the Apple Gorgonzola salad. The salads were pretty good not great but I thought it had a little too much vinegar for my liking. . We had the Margherita pizza with fresh mozzarella which I thought was very good, Chianti Braised Short Ribs where they gave us three huge ribs that were boneless and covered in gravy which was very tender and very good. We couldn't have ribs without Rosemary Potatoes (meat &amp; potatoes kind of guy) and they were really tasty and cooked perfectly. To top it off we had the Macaroni Rosa that had macaroni (of course) with a creamy sauce and chicken, broccoli and peas. It was really good. We ate it all up and had very little leftovers so that tells you the food was pretty good. No one seemed to be holding back. . We can't forget about desert so we had the Dolce Platter which included Tiramisu, Double Dark Chocolate cake, Cheese cake, and Apple Crostata. The deserts were fantastic. Really good and everyone enjoyed it. . The service was right on. Filling up our water glasses, beer, wine, ice tea, and soft drinks. Food came out in a timely manner too. So I have no complaints about the service. . So overall, I had a very good meal with lots of variety of food and massive amounts to fill up everyone. Coming here is about having a fun time and good Italian food. So enjoy, eat up but don't forget to unbuckle that belt after you eat all that food.","Tried the Pizza by the slice counter on our first night here at resort, best pizza I've had in a very long time and I'm from Chicago, so believe me, I know my pizza! Decided to try the actual restaurant for dinner tonight. Ordered Cesar salad for dinner, not very tastey, not enough dressing in salad, but croutons were delicious. Overall, I would recommend that everyone gives these guys a try.","Being from the midwest, I'd been looking for a place that served Chicago-style deep dish pizza and Yelp helped me locate this place (which just happened to only be about 2 miles from where I live). Vito's was really good! As it was just me, I had lots of leftovers and they reheated well in the microwave and I think may have even tasted better the 2nd day. Don't let the location scare you away, give it a try.","The pizza is bomb! Fresh ingredients everything's made to order. The staff are quick and friendly. I crave this place all the time now. Well worth it!","I love this place! Very cool, very classy, excellent selection of brews &amp; spirits. $1 off all beers, $2 off all wines, $8 off wine bottles, $4. 50 well drinks during happy hour from either 3 or 4 till 7pm depending on when they open. Small selection off pizzas &amp; appetizers. Very nice place to take a date","4. 5 stars. Food and baked goods on point. . Made our way here on Canada day. Got there around 11, was told it would be a 45 minute wait. Perused and walked to the basilica (and even went in) and made it back and waited about another 10-15 additional minutes  past the original 45 min. No biggy, though. Place is small and loud and bustling. . Food: Poached egg on your face panini. Perfectly cooked eggs, with a little bit of a kick to it. The boyfriend got the pizza pocket and that was deliciously warm and kind of sweet. Both sandwiches were reasonably priced. . What takes the cake here are the desserts. Although I was bummed because they didn't have the banana chocolate brioche, we tried the raspberry white chocolate brioche. That pastry was all around soft, sweet and tart and just very, very delicious. Also took a chocolate cooke and lemon poppy seed cookie home and those were moist, tangy, and rich. I love their pastries. . Service: Awesome. Friendly. They take american credit cards too. . I would definitely come again the next time I visit Montreal.","This location is closed. The website says they will re-open in a week or so on Fremont Street in downtown LV. . Decent pizza and cheep beer. Hope it stays that way when they open downtown","My husband and I grabbed a bite here before seeing a movie on a Sunday afternoon. We ordered 2 glasses of wine and the square margherita pizza. Despite our waitress admittedly having a bad day, she kept forgetting our order, the service was fast and friendly. The pizza was cracker thin and ok. We were actually left still a little hungry. I wouldn't go back, it was nothing special.","I've been here now several times and they have never disappointed. From the Chipotle sandwich to pizza to wings - it has all been delicious. The staff is super friendly too and the place is kept clean and neat. I love that you can walk by and see into the kitchen area too. Great place and I highly recommend it!","I gave this establishment another shot this evening. The food was pretty good although the garlic knots were a bit disappointing. The cheese was not melted nicely; it would have been great if they had been put under the broiler for a minute before being served. The pizza was enjoyable as was the pasta dish we ordered.  . They weren't overly busy tonight when we were there but it still took a bit of time to get our entrees and pizza. Servers were friendly but could have been a bit more on top of things.","For what this restaurant is, it is a five star all of the way! I found the flavors in the goat cheese and spinach pizza to be far beyond this restaurants price point. The goat cheese had a fantastic bitter quality to it and the spinach was fresh and cooked to perfection! You could even taste the quality of the olive oil and garlic used. Far better food, atmosphere, and service than I expected for a bar. I'm blown away","My husband and I had a late lunch/early dinner, nothing over the top, but not the usual 'chain' meal. Based on the reviews I read on yelp, we thought we'd give Trattoria Reggiano a go. We weren't disappointed. . Never have walked through the maze of shops within and around The Venetian, so we enjoyed the stroll to find T. R. tucked into a small curve in The Grand Canal Shoppes. We arrived around 5:00 and had our choice of dining 'in' or 'patio' (which basically means the wide side-walk of the shoppes). We joined two other parties on the patio (it's always entertaining to people watch in Vegas!). . Warmly greeted by Amanda (who was fabulous); gave us time to look over the menu. I wasn't sure about the chianti served by the glass and she offered to get me a sample. Pleasantly surprised to find it was a nice little chianti and was poured a very full glass of wine ($11). Hubby and I decided on a starter of Filet Mignon Meatballs ($12) since many reviews highlighted them; very good start to the meal. Good flavor, great sauce, and nicely proportioned.  . For dinner, my husband order the Salsiccia pizza ($15) while I, based on Amanda's suggestion, tried the special of  mushroom fettuccine ($16). In the meantime, the home made garlic rolls arrived (yummy) along with the above mentioned meatballs. May I add. . . the leftover pomodoro sauce from the meatballs is amazing with the garlic rolls. Hey, we're on vacation, calories and carbs don't count, right? Our entrees were served within 12-15 minutes.  . My husband enjoyed his pizza - especially the pieces of fresh garlic that were cooked in the pizza sauce. Said it had very good flavor although it didn't look anywhere as good as it tasted. The crust was nicely browned; crisp but a nice soft center. However, he agreed that my dish was definitely better. The pasta was cooked slightly al dente (perfect); the sauce was delicious and not too overwhelming (as I've had at other restaurants); and the mushrooms gave a wonderful depth and texture to the dish. Amanda had said it was her favorite meal but typically is only served once a month. Lucky me - it was wonderful. . The pizza was enough for two as was my pasta. As we (luckily) have a hotel room with a kitchenette, we took the leftovers with us. Nice late night snack after spending an evening in the casino, lol. The ambiance of T. R. is quite nice; quaint vibe of a Italian cafe much like you see when visiting Italy. As we visited for an early dinner on a Monday night (10/8/12), there was seating available. But leaving an hour later, all the tables were full and I noted some people waiting. . If you're looking for some good Italian food, in a casual setting, with some top-notch service, you'll want to visit Trattoria Reggiano.","Found this gem on yelp of course and enjoyed it very much! Allison our server was very kind and the food was delicious. We just came from twinsburg festival and needed a break, a great yummy break too! Kids got chicken nuggets and fries, sister got a veggie burger and said it was awesome, and I got the pizza add pepperoni  yum !","I have tried several different kinds of pizza here and never been disappointed. Tonight I tried the grilled chicken salad. . . again, I was not disappointed!  Generous portions, fresh ingredients, and prices that are reasonable. The service is always exceptional. . . I think the pizza is quite possibly the best I have ever eaten. . . I highly recommend this restaurant!","We really wanted to like this place!! We love Ground Control in Litchfield and we were so excited that a new pub-style place was opening in Surprise. Unfortunately this didn't live up to the hype. . We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table (even though we saw open tables) and then were seated in the noisy bar in a very strange table. We asked to be moved and you'd think we asked to move to the moon. They put us near the pizza area, the only people seated there (which was weird). We ordered beer, pretzels and cheese, and a burger to share. The \"beer cheese\" was really bad. It tasted like it came from a jar. . . they need to try the Mellow Mushroom beer cheese!! The burger was small and bland, fries were greasy. With two beers and the small burger, it was over $60!! What a waste. We won't be back.","Since we stayed at Aria we wanted to try restaurants the hotel had to offer. Being from Chicago we know about good pizza. The first time there we ordered a meat ball sandwich and wings. I was a little disappointed they didn't have bbq wings and there beer selection was pretty weak. The wings were ok the meatball sandwich was good. The second time there we ordered pizza. The pizza was really good and server Sheryl was great! We left that place with a smile. For good pizza check this place out.","Great childhood memories but absolutely horrible pizza &amp; customer service Tuesday night! If I could leave NO stars I would. Both our pies had no cheese or at least not enough to be considered pizza. When we called to complain the young man did NOT want to hear it &amp; firmly stated all ingredients are weighed out period. Left my name &amp; # for the manager/owner to call me (because he was too busy) and still have received nothing. I WILL NEVER GO BACK","I just don't get it. Why is this a local favorite? The pizza is below average at best, with crust so thin they have to cut it into small squares to be handled. I also ordered the Chicken Parmesan with linguine. The chicken was tough and chewy and the linguine had a grainy dry texture with very little flavor. They don't offer small side salads for dinner, only large two person salads. I'd eat at Carrabba's everyday of the week before going back here. The search for good pizza in Phoenix continues.","We absolutely LOVE Giant Rustic Pizza! We live about 20 minutes away and we'll make the drive for their yummy pizza. Their slices are ooey gooey cheesy slices of heaven! They have a cool lunch special - 2 slices and a drink for about $6. They used to have a specialty slice of the day written on a board behind the register, but on my last visit the board was gone. I'm assuming they no longer offer specialty slices. Either way, its good stuff! Giant Rustic is nestled in between a waxing studio and a nail boutique. Friendly workers and plenty of parking.","First thought, it isn't easy to find the first time. . . it is to the left, in a business park behind the post office. Second thought, damn good pizza and worth finding!. I tried the lamb and rosemary pizza, with roasted peppers etc, it was awesome. It was also a tough choice, all of them looked good. I loved the garlic infused olive oil for dipping the crust. It is what that crap that comes with delivery pizzas tries to be. . It is a huge open space inside, kind of odd decor, but the people working were helpful and friendly. They are only open in the evenings. Sure it costs a little more than delivery, but they do make a great pie!","The pricing seems a little high for what it is, I guess a combination of being just off the Strip and the halal meats, but the food quality is at least up there to compensate. #1 chicken seekh kabob left me with nothing to complain about as far as flavor, very tasty, fresh long-grain rice and a little salad on the side for $9. . If you want to go a little more inexpensive they do have a gyro, fries and small drink special for $8 that isn't on the interior menus. It's on a board outside, but I didn't see it until after I ordered as it was facing the opposite direction that I walked up from. . They do pizza and burgers too but I think that's just to placate kids. I'd stick with the Pakistani food here which is clearly their specialty.","Joe's, I want to love you but I don't. I think there are two types of people that go here. People that know the food is average and people who are in denial because of its geography. Your food is extra \"meh\" with a side of \"Hmmm. \". We have been here many times. The set-up is terrific. We make the trek and take our dog to nearby Cosmo Dog Park. . . then hop over for pizza, hamburgers, salads, etc. (I think we've tried just about everything. . . to no avail. How do you screw up BBQ pizza??). Since I may sound like a Negative Nelly, I will say I dig the milkshakes. . So why is it so popular? . This is a haven for East Valley apologists who want to have a signature restaurant to call their own but don't want to drive into \"the city. \" Look into your hearts, people of Mesa / Gilbert. Enough of the charade. You saw it on Food Network and you're happy there's some place there with a line out the door.","Reading previous posts, obviously people who like this place have never been to any decent pub whatsoever. . . . With that being said this place is never busy, especially during the day, and for decor wise it looks like a hospital with the wall paper . . . Food is mediocre but always frozen ya I can tell. . . . With that being said its no wonder why there is never anyone in there personally is rather have shitty service at Madison's or Boston pizza or actually the black bull pub but atleast the food is fresh and 9c wings at the black bull","We had our daughter's birthday party at Uptown Jungle today. I would have to say of all the places we have had birthday parties this was by far the worst experience. Our party was from 1-3. When confirming the details of the party we discussed with the party planner the strategy needed in order for us to set up some of our own decorations. She stated that we should arrive 15 minutes early so we could get it done in time, we just needed to let the people working the party counter know what we were doing. Today we arrived 20 minutes early. We were ignored (along with 2 other groups) for the first 10-15 minutes of us standing there with decorations and balloons in hand, hard to miss us. We finally got service and at that time were told that we would be able to have the party room at 2pm and the kids would be jumping from 1-2 then from 2:30-3. We were now stuck with our party decorations for 1 hour, and had no clue that would be our party room time. They tried to accommodate and gave us a room cart to store our belongings on until it was our time for the room. My mother, who was now livid, went over and talked to the manager. He told her that we already new what time we would have the room and it was communicated via email to us prior to the party. After receiving this information I pulled up the emails sent to me and talked with the manager. I asked him to show me where in the emails is stated that we would have the party room at 2pm and I do not appreciate basically being called a liar. He showed me on the email where it states \"Your party has 90 minutes of playtime and 30 minutes in the party room. \" I said I understood how the time would be allotted, but it doesn't state when the party room would be ours. I said according to what was just told to us was we would get to play for 60 minutes, the party room for 30 minutes, and finish with 30 minutes of play. He said no you get 90 minutes of play, then 30 minutes in the party room. I asked how this was possible if our play time started at 1 and the room was ours at 2, that's only 60 minutes. He was not following. He then went to the computer and checked and said our party room time would be at 2:30. I told him to go check the paper where the young woman wrote down 2pm not 2:30. After a little bit of back and forth in a civil manner he stated that the previous weekend. He had the same issue. I stated that the issue would be solved if the wording was \"you will start out with 90 minutes of play followed by 30 minutes of the party room. \" This would have solved the entire issue. I would have known ahead of time when we would have the room and I could have let the elderly guests we had arrive later into the party. . Once this was all taken care of we were off to the party. The place is too packed. I understand wanting to make as much money as possible, to have the place as packed as it is was very unsafe. They need to have a certain head count then stop people from coming in until a later time. Since you can continue to buy more time it is imperative to keep track of how many people are there. The kids that supervise the area do not do a very good job. This is the 4th time we have been to this location and every time it is the same thing. No supervision, older kids being too rough with the young kids, and too many people for anyone to truly supervise. . During our 90 minutes of play there is no offering of beverages to the kids as they are playing. With the amount of money you pay for a party there is no reason free carafes of water are not offered to the birthday party guests. Instead we spent an additional $60 to have beverages for the children and parents in our party. . During the party session we found the rooms to be extremely uncomfortable and warm. The girl helping with the party was not much help. We ended up serving most of the pizza to our guests along with the beverages. She was very helpful with serving the cake though which I feel was only because she wanted to hurry it along.  30 minutes is NOT enough time to eat, open gifts and have cake. The manager told my mom he suggests gifts be opened at home. Why wouldn't the birthday child open their gifts in front of the guests? Once you are in the party room it is just a rushed and stressful situation because of the \"time limit\".  . The plusses are the facility is great for kids 11 and under. There is a lot for them to do and have fun in an indoor environment to help keep them cool while being active.","Saturday specials include $2. 25 domestic bottles and $3 pizza slices. Pizza slice is pretty big, not bad for 3 bucks. Place is clean with a ton of TVs. Turkado sandwich was good. Onion rings are wonderful!","This is a great little pizza joint. They had a good coupon deal for wings, a pizza, and a hoagie, and everything we got was tasty. The \"spicy\" Italian hoagie was not spicy in the least, but large and very generous in meat, and very good. The wings we got were mild but actually more spicy than the hoagie. The pizza was pretty good, too.","Ordered Novanta for a work lunch yesterday (about 35 people) and the food was phenomenal. . . everyone was raving about how good it was. My colleague worked directly with Nick to get the right amount of food and the right mix (pizza, salad, antipasti, and cannolis). We will definitely be using Novanta again for future work events.","I've only been here during their late evening happy hour from 10-2 AM but this is a great spot for some food and drinks. Usually I order their flatbread pizzas or quesadillas which are both pretty good in my opinion, though the flatbread pizzas seem to be better. They have a great drinks selection of course and is a great spot for happy hour due to the atmosphere. It's nice to be able to hang out and relax here. . Outside of happy hour this review might be different, but from simply reviewing their happy hour I can say that I'm a fan.","Gave Fatbobs pizza a try tonight. Overall my family found the pizza to be average to below average. For the high price we thought it would be better. There are many other pizza places in Brunswick with better pizza for a lower price.","Great Mom and Pop lunch spot in Scarborough. Think what would happen if a sandwich and a pizza had a baby. Thats Mamajoun!!","Got the buffalo chicken pizza and it was pretty good except the excessive and thick ranch that was over the top and salty, drowning out any buffalo taste. I had to wipe half of the sauce off and the pizza tasted much better. The crust is great just like most brick oven pizzas. I ordered their $9 farm veg salad and that's was disappointing. From the description and the price, I thought I would be getting a large variety of garden fresh vegetables but sadly not so. It was mainly lettuce with shaved carrots and radish. . . that was it. Where are the beets, tomatoes, corn, broccoli, etc? So unsatisfying. Definitely a side salad. Could have tossed in some nuts at least to spruce it up.","The service was super slow. They had MAYBE 5 people inside and another 15 outside and we had to wait close to an hour for our pizza we NEVER got. Wouldn't suggest if you're hungry.","It's the perfect snack during the night if you get hungry. Good pizza. Portion is huge.","I love Pizza 73s pizza. But this place uses the same spatula to spread the sauces on the pizza. Many times when ordering a creamy garlic based sauce because I have a tomato allergy. I have found tomato sauce mixed in with the creamy garlic. Not impressed","This was our 2nd visit to this location, the first after they just opened. . We came in around 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon, not too busy as we were sat in less than 10 min. My wife and I decided to get the stuffed deep dish pizza, we always enjoy their thin crust so we thought this should be good. As we were ordering the waitress told us the deep dish can take up to 45 mins to bake, since we weren't sure we wanted to wait that long, we told her to make it a thin crust. She then told us it would be 30 mins for a thin crust!? So we decided for an extra 15 mins we would stay with the deep dish. . Over an hour later the pizza was finally delivered to our table and we were both starving. After a couple of bites, we both looked at each other and remarked how hard and thick the crust was! I was nearly impossible to cut it with a knife! Not only hard but absolutely no flavor to it. We ended up just eating the filling out of our slice which was good. We both did not want any more! When our waitress came back, she said that the manager wanted to buy us dessert for our wait but we literally lost our appetite from the pizza. We may go back again but never will order that pizza again, yuck!","We ordered delivery from Barros and got an XL pepperoni and 24 wings. The pizza here is AMAZING! It's hard to go anywhere else, get pizza, and say it's good after eating Barro's. The whole pizza, cheese, sauce, crust, pepperoni, and spices make this pizza extremely tasty. Again, I cannot reiterate how good it tastes. The wings, were meh, and a little soggier than what I prefer. The buffalo sauce tasted good, but I think the wings would be better if the either fried them or baked them a little longer. I wanted to give them 5 stars overall but feel all items should be up to par to earn this rating. The wings need a little work but were not bad. The pizza is for sure 5 stars. The price is decent too.","This was the worst pizza I have ever had. The cheese and sauce had both a sour taste and smell. The crust was bland and hard. The price was right at $3. 99 so I gave it a try instead of going to a pizza franchise. . . but it was too horrible to eat.","Thin crust pizza done correctly in the oven and a host of nice wines. The only crap thing was the music. Didn't go with the environment at all. Since I'm moving to this hood a year from now will go back. Amazing pizza.","We came in with a Groupon and sadly were told that even though the fine print had no exclusions, we could only order a pizza. I was hoping to order a pizza and a calzone or hoagie and pay the difference. But nope it was pizza only on weekends even though the place was empty and we were getting carryout. I did want want to argue with the abrupt person taking our order. . The pizza itself was quite good. We ordered the pesto chicken. Without groupon I never would have known about this place which is quite close to Robinson Mall. I no longer live in the Burg but come here often and would return . But shucks, why wouldn't you let me get a calzone!  Incidently the 3 star rating is the average of 4 for the pizza and 2 for the service. Never understand why a person in the restaurant business can't be pleasant and if you don't like Groupon then don't offer it.","Ordered the pizza on my phone. It said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. Went to pick it up. Worker looked up the order on the computer and said it wasn't ready yet. Didn't get the pizza until more than 40 minutes after we ordered it! Brought it home (5 minute drive) and guess what - the pizza isn't even hot anymore!!! I'm guessing the pizza was made on time but the order wasn't updated in the system? I don't know. But either way - waiting 40 minutes for a cold pizza is totally unacceptable. I've been to other locations and this has never been a problem.","Authentic NY style pizza. . . Mmmm :-)","After waiting almost a decade to share my favorite pizza with my parents I now know I should have kept waiting. I expected a bit of a line but I was rushed through checking and They were onto the next customer before my family could ask about pre ordering. Luckily a while later we heard some one else pre ordering so we did it too being told to pre order our deep dishes only.   45 minutes after ordering we were seated , just a few minutes late.   . We ordered appetizers since they quoted an hour and a half for deep dishes. And ordered a child's pizza and my father who loves pizza ordered his favorite pizza pepperoni asking the waiter which pizza he could order to be out no later than our deep dishes. He got a thin crust. . Our deep dishes didn't come out until we had been seated for over an hour, it took almost another hour for the KIDS menu pizza and the thin crust. We were there over 3 hours. OH and to top it off when the final pizza arrived it had no pepperoni on it. Instead covered in olives which he hates.   . I regret going there and feel embarrassed at telling them years how much I love this place. The servers were scrambling the whole place was behind while a non stop of carry outs and delivery were being paraded out the door. Save yourself the trouble of relying on their service. Just get a delivery if you must eat their food or better yet get a frozen one mailed from Chicago as this place doesn't deserve your money until they can meet the expectations they set. . \"We swear 10 more minutes max and it's out\" waited another 20. . This place doesn't deserve to wear the name.","Have only been here twice but good place to grab a drink and the pho and Vietnamese rolls were pretty tasty, although I would say this is a bonus to being in the bar - not the reason to go here. Pizza is just there but frankly I didn't go for pizza either. Owner is very friendly and works hard for her business! But as others note - this is first and foremost a bar.","Some of the best food I have ever had. . . BBQ chicken pizza was great and Rachel's burger was excellent. The best onion rings I have ever eaten. Here's a beginner tip, try the strawberry lemonade. How good is the food here? Sometimes we travel up from Tucson just for a taste. Also every time we ate in Phoenix we make sure and stop. You will not be disappointed.","The pizza is okay, it's an okay place to stop if you are in a hurry and want some pizza. However, there are much better options if you are setting out for the night with the intent to eat pizza. Prices are high for what you get and the service is much to be desired. Usually the girl running the counter acts like there are much better places she would rather be. So on that note, there are much better pizza places I would like to be at than here.","This review is for their location on 10431 N. 19th Ave, Phoenix, AZ  60-997-1007. Me and my office mate finally tried this location - we both ordered hot subs. I got the Ham and Cheese and she ordered the Turkey Breast. I LOVED this sandwich, the bread they use is very tasty - perfect crunch after being heated. Ham/Cheese and all he fixins were perfect in my book. I will go back and try the pizza by the slice. I also like their fries - seasoned steak fries. . This location is in a very small and old strip mall next to a dollar store. Inside is very clean and staff is friendly. We went during lunch hours and it wasn't too busy. Very filling and the sandwich size and flavor was perfect and i thought the cost was reasonable.","I waited for four hours in the blistering cold and asked for crushed red pepper and you still said no. . . the pizza is pretty shitty man they had no pepperoni pizza he likes it more than I do. . . I ain't that mad but I just don't like getting diabetes. The customer service was good nothing bad to say . . but the pizza tasted like frozen diabetes with sesame seeds.","Wow, amazing service and the most delicious pizza and pasta I've had in a long time! Pizza was picture-perfect and the regular crust had a nice crisp bottom. Smelled amazing and tasted even better. Our waiter was so attentive and genuinely nice, he got a 20%+ tip. Will come here again soon. This is the East Shea location.","The husband heard of Times Square on PBS and I had had it bookmarked for awhile SO clearly we had to visit. This place is nowhere near my house, but sometimes it's nice to get out of the neighborhood. We waited briefly for a table (maybe 15. . . 20 min max). I had to try the pizza because. . . . you know. . . . pizza. . . and it was decent. It wasn't mind blowing, but it was good. The real highlight of the night was the tiramisu. . . . I love tiramisu and this one was worth the calories. Anyway, if I were in the neighborhood, I would come back, but I probably wouldn't make a special trip.","It was a beautiful 75 degree day today, made even more perfect with a wonderful lunch outside at Joe's Farm Grill. We got there early to avoid the line (which rapidly appeared around 11:40am) so our food was ready very quickly after ordering. . My chicken pesto sandwich was wonderful - the meat was juicy and the peppers and mushrooms were fresh and yummy. Others in the group enjoyed pizza, burgers, and fantastic sweet potato fries which I couldn't help sampling. Everything looked and smelled great. . My only complaint was the condiment area which was very messy with spilled ketchup and ice everywhere. They needed to send someone out to clean it up more promptly. Otherwise, Joe's Farm Grill was an excellent lunch experience (as they usually are)!","Don't be fooled by the generic sounding name and dangerous-looking exterior. . . The food inside is cheap, delicious, filling, and relatively healthy! . I'm currently training in this neighborhood and don't have a car or the motivation to pack lunch everyday, so yesterday I decided to not judge a restaurant by its exterior and to invite myself in. I'm actually not a huge fan of pizza (crazy, I know), but saw \"falafels\" on the name banner and as a huge middle eastern food fanatic I knew I needed to at least see the menu. . I was pretty impressed initially by the pricing although not everything is dirt cheap, especially the salads, which are around $8-12, which is comparable to salads sold in downtown Toronto. The pizzas looked interesting, and I can see them making them from scratch in the back with all the giant ovens. I ordered the small falafel platter $5. 69, which came with a whole wheat pita, 3 deep fried falafels that they make on the spot, dipping sauce (tastes like tahini?), and a small aluminum container of side dishes, including hummus, baba gnoush, purple cabbage, marinated mushrooms, salsa, etc. Trust me, I eat a lot, and despite how small the portions looked, it was all very, very filling as you can expect from fiber and protein. Everything is supposed to be vegan, but who knows. There's also a large version of this priced at $8. Other non-pizza food options include salads, salmon platter, fries, soup of the day (made in-house, changes daily), etc. . The staff members are very nice, and there always seems to be a steady flow of customers. Most of the customers are Jewish and look like regulars, so evidently Pizza Cafe has received the stamp of community approval, which truly says a lot about the food!. They also do catering. . Will return!","I've eaten here twice for dinner over the last five years and was very pleased on both occasions. We had pizzas both times. They are wonderful!   They very much resemble the style we've had in Rome: very thin, crisp crust, light on the creative toppings. The portobello, artichoke, roasted peppers and fontina one was especially memorable. Service was very good - prompt, friendly and quick. Our waitresses were very pleasant. The prices may seem a little high, so if you want a cheap thick crust gloppy stuffed pizza, go elsewhere.","I went with my friends on a Tuesday night and I have to say, their service was pretty awesome. Our server was attentive, promptly refilled our empty water containers, and served us food all in a timely manner. For a table of 8, we didnt wait very long for all of our food to arrive; which was amazing since we didnt have to wait until our food is cold to begin eating. . Four of us decided to share, so we ended up getting quite a few selections from their menu. Their calamari and polentas were extremely well done, I loved the chili oil dipping sauce the calamari came with. The bruschetta was good, and the buratta was a very interesting app (it was the first time ive tried this). I probably would order the spicier version of it to try next time I come back. The pastas we ordered were all very delicious. I highly recommend the shrimp spaghetti, the sauce was beautifully done with plenty of tender shrimp on the side. The poor man's parmesan was crunchy on top, making every bite an experience. . The only thing I did not enjoy was the diavolo pizza. The balsamic vinegar was wayy too strong, it was all i could taste when I bit into it. I could barely finish 1 slice. . Overall it was a very enjoyable experience, I would definitely come back to dine again. On a side note our server was awesome as she split the bills perfectly for us without mistakes. Bonus!! :)","Just picked up my first pizza from Bruno's. WOW!!! Best pizza EVER and great service! The crust is amazing and the sauce is yummy! We will definitely be back!","Barro's is great. If you're looking for some standard takeout pizza, this is the place. Great cheese, great sauce, great crust. . And you might as well ignore that reviewer who gave this restaurant two stars because it's not better than something that is not the same thing at all. Well, no pizza is good as caviar, so I guess all pizza places should be three stars or lower. . .","Was excited to try location closer to us. Went in on non busy weeknight last week. Server was very quiet, couldn't hear her and not much of a people person. Put in an order for pasta for my hungry daughter with oil and garlic and she brought out plain spaghetti and told me oil and cheese are on the table. 20 mins later I asked if her meatballs were coming out. Oh I forgot to put them in. No apology or here let me grab them at no charge. So we just forgot about them. Had to ask me what beer my husband ordered again cause he was in bathroom and she forgot. Never came around to ask if he wanted another drink but manager finally did. First and second half of pizza came out almost cold. Couldn't guess why on that. Only two tables of two and one table of 8 at the time. Leftover pizza thrown on paper plates and in a brown paper bag with nothing covering them. Will not return would rather drive extra distance to Scottsdale or just go to Pomo downtown Gilbert!","We were honestly disappointed. When you go to a pizza place you expect at a minimum soda?? You can't drink beer there bc they have no liquor license so if you want a beer, you have to go next door and then they bring you your pizza. . and if you want something besides tap water with no ice, you get a choice of 3 seltzer waters. . : with no ice. Seriously SO weird. I ended up going next door to the coffee shop just to get a coke. The pizza was okay, the service was terrible. . nobody came outside to tell us we had to order at the counter, give us menus etc. for just opening up. . . we were disappointed.","My biggest piece of advice for this Flour and Barley is to come during happy hour. The prices will make a huge differences on how you feel about this place. . at least, that's how I felt. . The service was wonderful, if a little slow. Everyone was sweet and helpful, but it was somewhat busy so it took a little while to get things going. . The food was decent. We had pizza, cheesy bread, and calamari. A little too much sauce on the pizza, but otherwise everything was adequate: nothing to write home about. If we'd paid full price, I'd have been a little disappointed, but happy hour prices make everything better. . I like the location, being at the LINQ Promenade. This is a great place to walk around and even chill on the patio and people watch.","We are here today for my birthday and everything was great. We got seated very quickly and had a very friendly waitress named Lucy. Our food was amazing! We had pretzel bites which were the best I've ever had. I only wish we got more. Get them with pizza sauce! My husband and I both had salads. Very fresh and yummy! My Italian dressing was awesome. Then my son and I each had an 8in pizza. Very filling! I finished mine but he now has some for lunch tomorrow. My husband had a sub and he really enjoyed it. We will certainly be back. Very impressed with this place.","This is probably in my top 4 favorite pizza places in Charlotte. Its as close to real New York style pizza as you can possibly get in this city. It's very unassuming as it sits in a strip mall but go in, and you know its going to be legit. . They have a pretty extensive menu too, past just pizza's they have wings (that we'd like to try), entrees, and desserts. Other than just their regular slices, they have this one called a \"Stuffed Slice\" and seriously, one slice is enough for a family! Its stuffed with pepperoni, meatballs, sausage, and bacon and its a meat lovers dream. . My only downfall with this place is they clearly get a lot of delivery or pick up calls or something because when we go in, we definitely find ourselves waiting for a pretty decent amount of time before we get our food. Also, they're closed on Sundays, which is just ridiculous for a pizza place, but, it is what it is. If you're looking for New York style pizza, come here.","I first visited Humble with my girlfriends shortly after it opened. We shared a cheese board, a Lardo pizza (with literal pieces of delicious fat on it) and a bottle of Malbec. It was a casual night that felt a little fancy. We were tucked in a nice little booth towards the front. . I recently went back on the most perfect date. The atmosphere was great, the conversation was easy, the place wasn't too loud even though it was fairly busy and we were placed at the end of a long shared table. It didn't feel like we were crowded or encroaching on anyone else's space. There's even a nice patio out front; although, it was a bit too hot to sit outside on the particular night we went. We shared a cheese board with the server helping us pick our cheeses and I once again ordered a glass of Malbec since I enjoyed it the last time and it was his favorite. We then ordered a Cabernet Sauvignon (a domestic from California, though I don't remember what at the moment) and everything was very good. It was a wonderful evening though I never heard from him again so I'm starting to think maybe it was just a head full of yummy wine and an infatuation with this lovely little place ;) haha","All four of us me, my spouse, our 8 year old, and our 6 year old LOVE Jets pizza! It's always hot and fresh. Their salads are yummy as well!!!","I have such fond memories of Santos' pizza when I was a kid and I've twice convinced myself that this was going to be the same pizza as it was some 40 years ago. I have also now been twice disappointed. . In fairness, I have only had their pizza on the two occasions that I visited, and am therefore unable to comment on their other menu offerings, which I should point out is a wide selection of appetizers, sandwiches and other Italian standards. . For me the pizza just isn't anything to write home about. The crust is a bit thicker than I like (or recall from my yesteryears), and the flavor for me, isn't anything special. . The atmosphere gives me a bit of a \"Kitchen Nightmare\" vibe. That's not in any way meant to infer that the kitchen itself is anything but, but the dated decor and the dark dining room just isn't all that inviting. . The service was friendly enough. Not overly welcoming, but not off-putting either. All in all Santos, to me, comes off as an average, if not a bit tired, Italian Restaurant. . With that said, I'll probably take another swing at it, and try some of their other dishes. I'll hold off on any further judgement until then. For now though, 3 stars seems fair. It's \"good enough. \"","Michael's Pizza Bar has pizza that is virtually unmatched. The crust, sauce, everything is perfect. The prices are great and the staff is so friendly. . I used to live in Pittsburgh and would come here regularly on Saturday afternoons with my family. The server got to know our family and we always looked forward to catching up with her. Now that I'm in Chicago with tons of pizza options, Michael's still ranks towards the very best I've had. I make sure to dine here when I come back in town. . Do yourself a favor- start with the twistys. I'm drooling just thinking about them.","One of the worst pizza I had . They did not even bother to make the pizza correct for me. Overpriced . I would prefer blaze Anyday.","Jane was really good. Cocktails were good and original, not very boozy though ($10 each). Endive, apple, blue cheese and pistachio salad was nicely sized and fresh ($12). \"Schwartz\" pizza (smoked meat, mustard, cheddar, pickles) sounded awful, but was really, really amazing ($20). This was the standout. Pasta dish was decent and fresh ($19). Two of us shared the above and had almost half a pizza and about half a pasta dish to take home. You can order two starters and share a pizza, easily. Service was friendly. We will be back.","Great beer selection. Pizza is surprising good. . It is a great hangout place for friends and beer. . The servers are great and friendly, especially if you are there often. . They have pizza by the slice or by the pie. It is really good, which I did not expect. They also have sandwiches and salads.","Went on a Thursday. The atmosphere was great! Also the bartender was very awesome and helpful with out drink selections. Also, the pizza was very very good a very nice intoxicated lady purchased it for one of my friends birthday. Will return again.","Wow the pizza is cold and pepperoni is falling off like an afterthought . . . WTH sbarro? Now mediocre isn't even bad enough u have to go sub par with it. . . Smh","I discovered this place through a delivery app. Needless to say I've become a frequent customer since. I still need to try the pizza (I know, that's supposed to be what they're about), but I'm so in love with their hot sandwiches(all of them!!!) that I can't talk myself out of ordering one when I get the craving. I haven't had anything that hasn't been great. AND they deliver!!!  Total win-win for me.","Came here last night after hearing about it from a few people. I can't say I have the same raving review they gave. The pizza was just pizza. Nothin special. Standard size slice. I just find it ehhh. They are friendly so that's a plus.","Oh be still my heart! I do love me some oreganos. Sadly, not my favorite location but only because I'm head over heels for the Dobson and 60 patio (I like what I like, okay?!) I've always had quick, pleasant, and accurate service (except maybe one time but I'm giving the guy the benefit of he was just a tad awkward?) at this location and they always get our to go's right as well! . And HAPPIEST OF DAYS the original veggie wedgie is back!!! I was devastated when they took it off the menu a few years ago and I wasn't pleased with the attempt at a replacement. But it has returned and I actually did a happy dance when I saw it's back! Add the sweet potato fries (they have a kick, just a warning) and the aioli and it's a veggie lovers dream. . A few other things you haven't lived until you've tried: Picasso salad, deep dish n\u00famero one-o, guacatony, and the pizza cookie! . Go. Eat! And don't even think about calorie counting.","The pizza was good. The sandwiches delicious. The salads were okay, but not bad. We liked the atmosphere too","Wow I found a pretty good slice place down in Arcadia I was actually impressed really reasonable prices and really good pizza how can you go wrong some people may not like the burnt stuff on bottom but I think it's delicious we would like to play with the dough great texture and actually has some flavor and I did like the cheese as well perfect man of chew and stringiness the place is super small just a few tables but you gets the job done staff is friendly and explain things like specials and other things are going on definitely will be back","Had a blast. Really fun learning about some of the local craft brewers and drinking their beers. I had no clue some of these places existed so it was awesome to try some of these great beers. . Our first stop was at Bad Beat. (which deserves a review on its own soon)  Got to meet the brewers, toured their facilities, learned a little bit about the process and how they got started. Really informative if you're into beer. . Then we drank. It was 6 samples of some of their favorites. They were all very good. Some impressively good. Go there, or find their beer. . Steve our tour guide, and rad dude, rounded us up and we were off to the next spot. . Chicago Brewing in Summerlin was the next stop and was pretty impressive. We sat upstairs and could see down into the brewery. We had their stout and ipa, both of which were quite good. I liked the stout more. They fed us some appetizers and then we were on our way again. . We got dropped off on Fremont and went into Banger Brewing, which is a pretty awesome spot downtown for a good beer. Steve told us a little about the place and then we got another flight of beers to taste. I like the ipa a lot and found the jalapeno beer to be really interesting. It would be awesome with pizza. . Really a great time. Can't wait to do it again. They said they'll be going to different breweries in town so it won't always be the same. . If you love beer, you'll love this tour.","Akron is a burger town. Swenson's and Skyway rule the night for anyone hungry. Burgers here are like those crazy Chicago hotdogs or the thin folding pizza in NYC. . So, I was skeptical when this national chain showed up an eigth of a mile from the 'secret' Swensons tucked back on the other side of the street. Another gimmick: giant burgers with unlimited toppings and fresh cut fries. People yelling orders. Everyone being hustled through to make room for the next customers. . I went with my friends and it was pretty good. First the bad: you have to know what you want before you even go through the door. The gimmick is that its so good you have to hurry up. But then you order like you're at skyway. A  couple of burgers, some fries and a coke. You shuffle along and get your bag of food. WTF? It weighs six pounds. You realize that a Five guys burger is gigantic and loaded with everything good. Mushrooms, onions on and on. Its like a fast food garbage burger from Max and Erma's. You have enough food to eat for a week. . It might not be as good or as Akronish as Swenson's but if you're really really hungry this place will put you to bed. . If you like those county fair fries with the skins on them, you'll like the fries here. If you'd rather have those perfection fries from Swenson's skip the five guys fries. Youy won't need them. You're gonna do about 4500 calories on the first burger alone. Burp.","Pleasently surprised with interior, clean, good lighting. . Excellent pizza, tons of pepperoni. . Very good chicken parm.","Pretty cool place. I brought my Son and Daughter here to play. They have big beanbags to sit down on and watch if you'd like if your not participating. Very comfortable. Lots of different things to do besides just jumping on the trampolines. Ropes course, zip line type deal, basketball area, dodge ball area and a couple other areas. I actually brought my Daughter back for a Birthday party and invited a couple of her friends too. They all seemed to have a good time. We got to use one of there rooms for pizza, soda and cake. The only problem was trying to get the kids to stop jumping around and leave. The one srtar deduction is because sometimes it gets to be a little overcrowded and not a lot of room. You have to wait in order to get a turn in dodge ball and other games. When you get billed by the hour that waiting eats up your time and you waste it. Dodge ball takes 5-10 minutes to be over so your limited on how many games u get to play!! Other than that always a good time!!","Joe's Farm Grill  of my favorite places, ever. This and Joe's BBQ. I can't put my finger on what it is that makes my mouth water at the thought of either restaurant. . At Joe's Farm Grill, it could easily be the amazing ingredients. So fresh and flavorful, and you know you aren't eating some strange lab grown tomatoes. I love sitting outside under a GIANT tree, looking over at the Agritopia garden. . . Joe's definitely has something you don't find very often here in the commercial, cookie cutter East Valley. . Like Joe's BBQ, everything here is perfect it its own way. My favorite is the burger. Yup, I said it. Veganish me loves cheeseburgers here. I don't eat burgers often, but when I do I crave Joe's. The bun is amazingly fresh and soft, the veggies are top notch and the meat. . . The meat is melt in your mouth delicious. . Other notable dishes: pizza, ahi salad, bbq sandwich (uses Joe's Real BBQ sauce, of course!) and the awesome fresh made milkshakes. . I know Gilbert is a trek for a lot of people in the Valley, but it is absolutely one worth making.","Yeah it's a no for me. . . Was recommended the margarita pizza by the bartender lol. I 'lol' only because I wonder if he was just 'trying' to sell an item on the menu? Does he not know good food? The tomato sauce base was so bland. The sauce tasted like a brand I'd buy in the no-name section  of No Frills, if I was desperate and there were no other tomato sauces  left on the planet. I didn't finish the pizza - it was meh. . I've had the cheesecake from Scaddabush at the Front street location, and the Mississauga location and it was creamy, however the same cheesecake at the Etobicoke location tasted tougher in texture. For the first time in my life, I can't really put a finger on it, as to why it was off to me. I noticed too it was a little tanned at the top of the cheesecake and I've never seen the cheesecake like that before at the other two locations. For an Italian restaurant, they really need to step up their game. It did not taste like authentic Italian cuisine. At the end of the day, I would have been happier going to Metro to buy the pizza that they make fresh and  fire in the oven. That's sad really. . . that I would have been more satisfied going to a chain grocery store for pizza. . C'mon , you had one job Scaddabush. Well won't be returning  to the restaurant. I guess  I'll make Joey's my hot spot for my end of the week treat!","Seriously the best pizza in town. Wow. This is what pizza SHOULD taste like. Try the pesto pizza!","I learned of this place while trying to use a Restaurant. com credit. Yelp seemed to have good ratings, so I used the credit and bought a certificate for Miele's. . They center it is in is a bit dodgy. NW corner of Dobson and Guadalupe. It's next to the Pawn Shop. . Upon entering the decor is absent. It's really just a small podium and several blank walls. What did I get myself into? But from the podium they led us down a nondescript hall into the dining area. The decor here was still a bit lacking, but better.  \"Romantic lighting\", several small tables. . . starting to feel like a bistro!  When we arrived there was quiet live music. I should comment that the music was really nice. Not at all Italian, but I liked that the musician wasn't blaring. It was nice background music that allowed people to have a conversation without yelling. . We were seated at one of a small number of tables.  (Reservations might be a good idea. . . most of the evening I didn't see more than 1 or 2 empty tables, so I can see them being packed sometimes. )  They have an extensive menu. Almost too much. How can a small bistro kitchen cope with so many different dishes and maintain quality? After looking at sandwiches and pizzas and different chicken dishes and veal dishes I settled on the bolognese. Properly done this should not be \"spaghetti and meat sauce\". My wife ordered chicken toscana. We also got the calamari appetizer. . The calamari was good. Simple, but good. Not rubbery at all, nice light crunch of the breading. Done well. At the same time they brought out \"house bread\". They make it themselves. It's really good. As good as any bakery. . The entrees came with a house salad. My wife liked it. I don't do salads, and they would not substitute for a soup. I could order a soup, but no substitution. Annoying. . My bolognese was really good. Perfect, really. Portion maybe a bit small, but the pasta was done properly and the bolognese sauce was dead-on. Very flavorful. My wife loved her toscana. I didn't particularly (it was 'ok'), but she was very happy with her choice. I mean really happy with it!. The bistro is owned by a middle-aged couple. It's not a chain. The chef has worked there since before this couple owned it, or so they told me. I think as long as that chef is there we have a new favorite Italian place. Yes, they are more expensive than the Olive Garden. But they are so worth it if you love Italian food. We are looking forward to trying them again very soon.","Every \" all you can eat \" restaurant  can learn a thing or two from Johnny Smalls. Serve your food in small portions only allowing a few choices at a time and charge for any food you waste. I love the tapa style dinning!. Came here with a group of six people. We all took turns ordering 2 items (which are snack size portions) at a time. The first go around we finished everything we ordered and where eager to order the next round. By round 3 we were all looking a little full and only ordered a few thing we really wanted seconds on. . You can sample a little of everything on their menu. From chicken and waffles, seared tuna, carnitas tacos and grilled PB&amp;J. Or if you want a salad trio and pizza and sliders they have that too. Nothing on the menu was disappointing. Come hungry, leave happy not stuffed (unless you want to be)","I order from these guys about twice a month. . . . always friendly on the  phone and the food is usually quite good. They're close to my house so I always pick up. I recommend for those who don't like pizza chains (I don't).","Wife and I both got sick over their pizza. It didn't taste right. I did like the peppers they use. But that's the only nice thing I have to say.","Finally a good real Italian restaurant in Las Vegas! I was born and raised in Italy so I'm very picky when it comes to Italian food, and I can honestly say that Trattoria Italiana is my favorite Italian restaurant. It's family owned and that gives that personal touch that you can't find in the chain restaurants; I met Milena, her husband Ninni, her brother Pasquale, her son Giovanni, Laura the waitress, and they were all so nice to me and my family! I like the atmosphere because it feels like being in a real Italian trattoria, I like the table clothes on the tables (typical in Italian restaurants but not here in the states), the bread is phenomenal, they make it with pizza dough and it's still warm when they bring it to the table, and the list goes on. I and my family will definitely go back to Trattoria Italiana!  . We went there again for my husband's birthday the other day and we both had pizza: it was really good and I'm going to post pictures so you can see what I'm talking about!","Great service with big portions. Always expect a wait but they do try and make it as pleasant a wait as possible. I love everything I've had from there. A few of their dishes are a bit salty but their pizzas are great.","By far the best pizza in Vegas. They also make an amazing vegan pizza! And they now offer delivery!  And you can order from their website!","The pizza was not that remarkable. it came barely warm. One person in our party ordered a chicken wrap and as the rest of us finished our pizza the wrap still had not been served. We eventually cancelled it . The staff was apologetic .","We were just wandering around Little Italy and came across this busy restaurant tonight! The service was excellent, I could not remember if I had ever had such delicious pizza before. Options for vegetarians and meatetarians. The crust was so tasty, topped with simple ingredients. Our waiter explained the menu and options that we could add to it. . I would totally recommend this restaurant. Definitely make reservations!","I was in town for work this week and was nosing around for some good italian cuisine. I typed in \"cacio e pepe\" to see what hits I would get. I first had this dish in Rome last fall and I was jonesing for a fix. . I arrived by myself around 7:00pm and had no trouble getting a seat. I chose to sit at the pizza bar, even though I wasn't planning on getting the pizza. . Zenia was my waitress and she did a great job. I came for the cacio e pepe, but she talked up the meatballs enough to pique my interest. She was willing to give me a smaller version of the meatball starter (essentially a side of two meatballs in sauce). She asked if it was okay if they were plated together and I requested that they be plated separately. I was brought some bread and olive oil to nosh on while waiting for my meal. The bread wasn't remarkable, but it did a find job of sopping up some of my leftover tomato sauce. . My food arrived extremely quickly and it looked beautiful. The pasta was terrific. The noodles were nicely al dente and that familiar black pepper taste was prominent. I ate it all. The meatballs were good, but didn't wow me. Which is fine, because I'll eat that pasta all day. . One of the most enjoyable parts of my dinner was being able to chat with the folks on the other side of the pizza bar making salads and pizzas. They were extremely friendly and happy to answer any questions that I had about their pizza oven and how they make their pizzas. . The next time I'm in town, I will happily make time to venture up the Mirage to chow down on the cacio e pepe at Osteria Costa. And I'll try the pizza.","Just had dinner at Empire. I go there sparsely to try their different pizza pies. Tonight was an experience. The wait staff was so confused and delivered the wrong stuff about 3 times until we finally got to eat. The waitress also introduced herself to us 4 times which got really annoying when she kept interrupting my conversation to tell us her name once again. The music is good and certain pizzas are quite yummy! Think the wait staff needs to focus on being a restaurant and bar more than just the bar part and they'll have it down. Great selection of items too.","This is by far the best pizza place in CU approved by my Italian spouse. They have the nice crust and pretty good quality authetic topics (cheeses and so on). . If horrific deep dish American pizza is your thing, don't bother going here.","Awesome pizza and service. We were in Boulder City antique shopping and were looking for lunch. I know we can get pizza anywhere but Tony's was great. It was quiet compared to the sports bar and diner next door. Would definitely recommend them if you're in town!","Favorite pizza place in town. The owner Nick started at Cafe Porta Alba but he really shines with his own place. Try the Signature Novanta Pizza - it's a great mix of burrata cheese, arugula and balsamic glaze.","Memories, came to get a couple of cuts of cheese pizza when visiting Pittsburgh to see a Pirate game. I judge how good pizza is  plain with no toppings and this is as good as I remember it in high school, way back in 1979. This is not the place to get your yuppie pesto with chicken, it is a pizza joint like where I live now in the Tacoma area we have Teriyaki joints, you do not go to these places for atmosphere,  or a dining experience, you go for a specific food done well.","DESTIHL is one of my go-to's when bringing friends and family from out of town out to dinner- not only does it have an extensive menu that will cater to even the pickiest of guests, their service is excellent and we always leave there full and happy! . For apps: The Bavarian style pretzels are soft and fluffy, and the IPA mustard sauce is a nice treat. We have also enjoyed the skillet nachos, and the cheese curds; however, we usually go for a dessert instead of an app. . Entrees:I try to get something new each time I go, and some of my favorites include the dijon chicken, the coulotte steak, the vegan squash and cashew cream \"pasta\", the gaucho skirt steak, and the brewmaster's pizza. . Like I said, don't skip on the dessert; I get the chocolate peanut butter mousse cake every single time (though you'll want to share it if you want to be able to walk out of the restaurant on your own!), and the toffee date doughnuts are a surprising treat. My fiance adores their giant carrot cake and sour cherry bread pudding if you're not a chocolate lover like me. . I do recommend making a reservation as it can get quite busy, and though I haven't been yet I have heard fabulous things about their weekend brunch so give that a shot if you have a chance!","new italian restaurant. they make their own sauce and pasta \"everyday\" according to the waitress who served us. food was okay. garlic bread sold as \"charity bread\" was very tasty. . . . apparently net proceeds are donated to some charity. . because it is new. . . . staff are inexperienced. they brought out a water bottle which they couldn't open. . . served us a pizza called \"americano\" instead of coffee americano (not sure why they thought we'd order 4 main dish for 3 people). . . and when the coffee came, they forgot about cream which we had to ask for. . . by the time we got the cream. . . coffee was cold. still charged us full price, whopping 4 bucks for a very small amount of coffee. . . 4oz maybe less. . we were entertained for a while by the mishaps, but found the overall experience underwhelming. decent ambiance, louder music than I'd like, service can be significantly improved.","Fun spot for a snack, the menu and relaxed atmosphere mean it's more of a bar-with-food place rather than a full-on restaurant. . Mushroom pizza is pretty good, appetizer sized for two or three. Drink menu, like most Vegas places, is a bit generic but has good breadth. . Zero reason to get excited about it, but if you need a more casual option in Mandalay Bay, it's acceptable.","I'm not sure where the other reviewers shop but I don't think that this place is at all expensive. Giant Eagle employee? The Iggle has a monopoly and no place could be more expensive. They have a good selection for the size and even have organic foods.  . The prepared food is very good. I like the lunch hot and cold bars. The pizza is excellent. For an independent small grocery, I think they're doing well. The salad bar could be better. The dressings are not home made and are of questionable quality and safety. Some of their food isn't edible. I hated the broccoli salad. The desserts are probably not scratch and some are purchased and displayed. . The service has a range too. Very good to terrible. I think with some attention to detail and care, this place could be great.","A short walk from my hotel in old Montreal. This restaurant lived up to the reviews. Started with sliders and I had a mushroom, cheese pizza (#2 on the list) and my associate had the ricotta stuffed pasta - we split and both were awesome. . Worth exploring. Nice interior design, and the service was excellent. . Don't hesitate for a casual Italian dinner - this is your place!","My daughter ordered a large pizza and 8 wings online. The delivery came and it turned out to be a small pizza and 16 wings. When I called the store and asked them to review the order #, they read the order we received. I explained that's not what my daughter ordered, to which they replied, she must've hit the wrong buttons and proceeded to hang up. IF I wanted to order another pizza, don't you think that would be a perfect opportunity to rectify the problem??? Nope!!!  When my wife called back, Casey the manager was extremely rude and offered nothing but a customer service phone number. We will never order from Papa John's again. . . no matter where the location.","Their ceasar salad and burata salad are excellent! I enjoyed the burata with yummy sweet cgerries and seasonal peaches. Their pizza rivals Filippis in San Diego! It's a thin crust and their seasonal \"meat\" pizza is awesome! If you have an egg allergy their crust, grilled (on an actual grill!) ciabatta bread, daily made from scratch spaghetti and buccatini noodles are made w/o eggs,  as is their gelato and sorbet. My daughter had the kids spaghetti and it was great too! The restaurant is cute and clean. The chef picture here is UBER talented and quite helpful. Their service is kind, quick and happy. Our server was Katy and she was delightful. Come and enjoy this Italian gem in east Mesa!","I love the fact they have variety  Juice bar, Grill, Desert (sweets) and Flat bread (pizza) areas. . I love the Flat bread area. It like a thin crust pizza and you can select topping on it, I love their spicy chicken but I also ordered Zatar and spinach with cheese which were decent. It is also good to order with friends as you can order bunch and try them. I had these as take out and they were packed nicely. . For my Muslim folks - They serve halal meat!","Awesome pizzas, but definitely order off the regular menu!!! The pastas are homemade, the giardinara is the bet I've had, and the desserts are created by the pastry chef from Sage! Homemade gelatos and ice cream sandwiches should not be missed!","Came here for date night on Sunday, cute little place, pretty good pizza, but no garlic knots that night which was a serious bummer, then we were going to do a deal which was like a pizza and some wings but it didn't say on their site the deal offer ends at 4 or something, and I swear they forgot our order and had to ask us about it like 2 separate times.","I cannot FUCKING BELIEVE I didn't visit here the last time I was in town. Sweet Jesus, I love the O. And I've never even had one of their famous hotdogs. No, I'm all about those fries, and the pizza too. But now I just want to eat it all. Every last one. I want to grow a huge ass that is composed of nothing but O fries and cheese. I guess that's one dream that won't come true. Sob, sob.","Really enjoyed the pizza here, service was great as well. We had the Enza. Its a nice snack size pizza, thin crust. Nice light pizza. Will come back.","Used to be a favorite spot but it has gone down in quality ALOT. Lack of consistency and poor food quality has driven us away. Each time we ordered we would say \"let's give them one more try\" but after many chances and disappointment we've decided we're all set. One time I ordered an individual slice of pizza and asked to add pineapple and when I received my slice it seriously was awful. The cook took pizza from the night before (we came in right when they opened and I knew the pizza was not fresh) , heated it up, then threw on cold fruit cup of pineapple. . . . which in turn made it a soggy sorry pizza slice. . I mean seriously? Wouldn't one think to add pineapple to the pizza then put it into the oven??","What a great place!  We hit Joe's last week one evening when the temperature was downright pleasant for outdoor dining. I had the Sonoran dogs, which were great, the bacon could have been crisper for my liking, but a very well done dog!  My wife had the buffalo chicken, and loved it. We had a kids grilled pepperoni pizza that my toddler refused to eat ( instead going for the star of the meal my garlic fires). I can say the kids pizza was quite good!  Oh and the milkshakes, oh the milkshakes!!  So yummy and delicious. The setting was great, the service was excellent, and the food was crafted by people who cared about what they were serving. I can't wait for the temperature to drop so we can go back!!","I visited Amelia's in late July with my husband and his family. We ordered two large pizzas for our group; the vegetarian and the five cheese. The service was timely (we were after all their only customers at the time) and our waiter was friendly and attentive. The pizzas however were just OKAY. . It's not that they weren't good, but rather Amelia's slightly greasy pizzas stand at the border between fast food and proper restaurant food. They're good, but as I chewed through the fat, the fluffy crust and the cheese, I couldn't help but feel the same way as when I order a pizza from Pizza Pizza; doubtful of my dietary choices, and wondering if I might have gotten a better deal in terms of quality for the price elsewhere (the answer is \"yes\", especially if you are hungry for real Italian pizza). . Amelia's serves American pizza. That's alright, so long you don't expect high quality food. It's good, but not great. I wouldn't backpedal if I was invited for dinner, but I will avoid going back again by myself.","Went for a bite after going to the art museum - Nice mix and variety on the menu - Salad, pasta, and pizza options - Ordered a salad and two small pizzas at the counter and food was brought out - Salad had good flavor and was worth the price but had a few pieces of greens that were in that soft mushy state - Pizzas - Had the duck and tomato/olive pizzas - Flavors were good on the toppings, dough was a little bread-like but overall a good  just wanted a little more duck - Staff was nice and worked hard to ensure a decent meal","Ordered a pizza a few weeks ago &amp; have to say it was horrible. It seemed almost raw. The crust was cooked but the cheese was white not the golden color on a good pizza. It's a shame because it's so close to home. We've had food from there before but it's been awhile &amp; it use to be good. I guess I'll be sticking with Rocco's because they are always consistently good.","Went here for lunch with my fianc\u00e9e and his mom because we were considering having our wedding rehearsal dinner here. I absolutely adored the ambiance of the place, kind of rustic but also modern with hints of Italian decor. . We all 3 ordered different items coincidentally, but it allowed us to get a good feel for their food quality and range. I had the mushroom flatbread pizza, which was seasoned excellently and finished with a nice, crisp crust. I took half home because it was a nice size. My fianc\u00e9e ordered rotisserie chicken and chorizo tacos, which was from their brunch menu. It came with 3 tortillas plus a heaping pile of fried potatoes with two over easy eggs on top. He cleaned his plate, though it took some effort. His mom got the grouper sandwich, she was in between that and the salmon salad and the waitress recommended the grouper. It looked really yummy, seared golden brown and served with some sort of aioli. She also ate it all and it came with a nice salad on the side of the plate. We all enjoyed our food and the atmosphere, so we're looking forward to doing our rehearsal dinner here come September!","Um Caliente SERIOUSLY!?!. So after work I decided to order a pizza a pie. Nothing too crazy. A Red Pizza by my definition is a pizza with red sauce on it. Apparently, not this time. Anywho I ordered a Red Pizza with Parmesan on the side and garlic sauce. . I received: Cheese with extra red sauce. No Parmesan, and some weird sauce with green stuff in it maybe it cilantro/basil I don't know. Plus it was undercooked! Thats kind of a trifecta of badness by my definition. I dont know. I would like to say this was the first time I've received an undercooked pizza which I had to send back but alas it is my third. . Caliente, whats going on?!?! I'm confused, bewildered, baffled even. Step your game up or else Giovanni's is more than welcome to take my money anyday.","Not much to rate, they had some good pizza. I had a spinach and mushroom pizza. Still haven't found a pizza joint in Charlotte that does beef pepperoni yet. But this place is good I ride by it all the time and finally stopped in to give them a try. Thumbs up, I also had the Chicken Philly Sub and that was very good also. Oh and I just found out that they have beef pepperoni.","VIBE . It's a cheese shop, so lots of cheese. . The guy that works here is pretty blue collar. He won't serve you. You have to ask him questions. *Annoying! . I ATE . I came here because I was told about their fabulous $5 sandwich special at lunch. . Again, I had to ask ask ask. The guy wouldn't suggest much to me. You're basically getting salami and provolone on a bun. It's cheap and cheerful but not super filling and I don't think completely worth the value. . You will get better value at Panago down the street for their $5 flat rate for a pizza or a salad. . It's not bad for a snack though if you have a hankering for a quick sammie or something more than a bagel. . OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK . I guess the staff have been tired of the high school kids crowd in the area? I don't know. Not sure if it's the first place I'd go for cheese but the $5 sandwich deal is not bad!","I love Santo's homemade pasta, especially the Cavatelle with exceptional marinara sauce. It's up there with the best I've ever had. The pizza is also yummy. . Salad, however is horrible iceberg lettuce with a harsh vinegarette and that cheap shredded cheese. . So 5 stars for pasta, pizza, and sauce.","Went on Tuesday for $1 slices and $1 PBRs, Miller High Life and Natty Light. The cheese pizza was decent (a little on the greasy side, not a ton of flavor). Apparently the pepperoni was very good. . . it looked different than the cheese so it may have different seasonings and preparation along with the addition of pepperoni. The up side was that the service was pretty good and the daily specials that they have are an awesome value. $3 for a slice and two beers is an amazing deal.","This is a very decent hotel for the price and location. It's almost right on the strip and very close to the main attractions. We stayed here mid June during EDC week - four nights for $440 is not bad!  The room was very clean, although not new and remodeled like the website confirmation promised. The bathroom was a bit dated with old yellow tile floors and an ugly bath tub, but still very clean. There's a food court in the hotel with fast food and pizza. The pizza at the food court is a bit pricey, and I recommend getting pizza at the place right next to the elevators. One slice is HUGE and they're pretty good.  . My main complaints are that it can get pretty loud during the day from the Drais pool party right next door and that you have to wait a lonnnnggg time for the elevators.  . I would definitely consider staying here again the next time I'm in Vegas.","2 stars if only for the food (etc. ) The additional star is for the wonderfully cheery petite girl working behind the bar. . The experience started off odd as I guess I expected this spot to be a little more cool and quaint instead of situated next to a Tilted Kilt (the \"Scottish\" Hooters). I'm sure the ambiance is much better at night when there is controlled lighting versus the sun blazing in from all the windows. Anyways, my misconception and this has in no way affected my score. . Then it didn't help when I walked in on an employee standing up with the hostesses at the entrance loudly bitching about something. All seemingly in agreement. So I just interjected with an. . \"I'll just eat the bar\", since I was rolling solo. Followed by an awkward look exchange with a member of staff standing behind the bar that I was now sitting at. It was something of a forced smile or perhaps he was squinting due to sun coming in from the window. . . either way he spoke no words. . Instantly things got better as my bar server approached to greet me and offer a beverage and a lunch menu. Such a cutie pie this one and nice as nice can be. And she never let my water get anywhere close to empty and I was drinking it like a fish. . Often I have trouble deciding on what to order and like to request the assistance of my server who has undoubtably eaten everything on the menu or at least has seen it, so I ask the ray of sunshine which she preferred out of the smoked salmon and the crispy shrimp. Without hesitation she informs me, \"crispy shrimp!\", her favorite thing. Sold. And I also order the simple chopped salad ($5). Well if that was the best thing I worry about the rest of the menu. Sure they came out hot and crispy but there was very little flavor. I actually had to salt them. ( perhaps they took Angie M. 's review to heart too soon). The sauce was good but only when used sparingly. The portion was generous but for $13 bucks that should not just be \"filling\". . The simple chopped salad was alright but very overdressed, rather soggy and the vinegar level in the dressing made my lips burn a bit. It was also topped with a powdered \"cheese\" similar to that that comes in packets with delivery pizza. . I left full but thinking I made the wrong decision on where to eat, because it was not worth the 24 bucks it cost here for lunch. If this restaurant is smart though they will never let go of that little girl behind the bar. She is a gem.","I have a good friend in town who has his own wood fired pizza oven and we have some really great parties over there where everyone designs their own pizza. The oven is so hot it cooks in about 3 minutes. The only down side is that when the pizzas come out, everyone descends on it and you might get two bites out of it. So, you have to just keep making pizzas. . With Custom Built Pizza, I don't have to worry that my specially designed pizza is going to evaporate. I decided to choose a gluten free crust, I mixed pesto and marinara sauces, added strips of good quality mozzerella, shredded mozzerella, peppers, black olives, basil, fresh pineapple and chicken sausage. I was surprised at how quick the pizza was served. I was apparently very thirsty as I drank two Arizona Teas with my pizza. I loved this combination and it was something I wouldn't have tried on my own. Everything was very fresh. . I had a very nice visit with Loren F. over dinner. I was amazed I ate so much pizza but still had enough to take home for another meal.  . I have lived in Las Vegas since 1985 and so I've been around town. This is right up there with maybe my top three pizza restaurants. Great for families, kids, or anybody who loves a great pizza.  . The only change I would like to see is free refills on tea.","Had a late lunch today at Giordano's on N. 83rd ave Peoria Az.  We were very impressed with the staff, there was a minor issue with our order and our waiter Chris R came out to check on us frequently and let us know what was going on. He did a great job and when our order came the manager was awesome and told us due to the wait they would remove the charge for the pizza and also give us another discount. They went above and beyond. The food was great and service awesome. Highly recommend this location and will be back!  Thanks guys for taking such good care of us.","This place changed hands, and my son was so upset at the changes he cried. . They took down all the superhero decor, removed the bouncy ball machine that my kids loved, and no longer allow the kids to make their own pizzas. They also dont have the coloring contest anymore and they changed the way the cheesesteaks were made, which was a big reason to come here. These were all the things we loved about this place - POOF - gone. . I was super sad about all of this. . My best wishes to the old owners, wherever you are. My best wishes to the new owners too, cuz this was one longtime customer who probably wont be back. . Moral: if you buy a place and take over, dont make too many changes. You'll lose your customer base.","Can't beat the game deal in the stadium. $25 for a large 1 topping and two drinks, with 1 free refill on each!! You won't eat better or cheaper anywhere else inside that park. Pizza is huge and so good!! Cannot wait to try their other locations, because the listed menu is limited in the stadium. . Still they also have pizza by the slice, salads, hoagies, garlic knots (which smelled delicious) and beer specials. You can order ahead of time, and can use the entrance as a gate into the stadium. Honestly such a great spot for families at the Pirate game!!","This steak house sucks. They sat me and my family at the waiting area for 30 minutes and they had seats open but no waiter. So lazy, dumb way to run a Business. The servers were jerks, I just walked over to bricks pizza just finished it was so good!","Customer service here is terrible. I ordered a pizza on my way home from a 40 min drive, realizing I forgot my purse at work when I went to pick it up. No offer to look up my card number or anything so who knows what happened with the food - hopefully it did not go to waste. After about an hour and a half when I was on my way home again at 9:40, 20 min away, I called again to order, the person on the phone kept hitting buttons and telling me the disruption was on my end and in between the loud beeps, asked me if I could be there by 10 because they close their doors at 10. Needless to say, I said forget it and placed my second order at one of the MANY nearby stores that keep their doors open way past 10 pm on a Friday night. And when I drove by on my way home from driving out of my way for the second time that night around 10:30 pm, all the employees were standing around talking in the parking lot. Must have had important things to do. Won't be ordering from them again.","Over priced and under delivers!. - A 12 inch pizza was likely only 10 inch. . - It barely fed the two of us. . - Tasted okay (definitely nothing to brag about). - At $25, this was definitely not worth the price!. - Won't be ordering from there again.","Best pizza in town, my family and I just moved to this beautiful city and asked around for the best pizza in town. Grimaldi's is definitely the town favorite. My family and I agree. Our server Megan was very nice, welcoming us to Las Vegas. Great service, not to mention free cheesecake on your first visit to the restaurant. We plan to bring our family here when they visit.","This is my favorite pizza by far in the North Phoenix area!  We take the kids here for dinner and never worry about them being too loud. Great for take out too!","I feel a little weird reviewing a chain, but I had some seriously awesome food here earlier today for lunch. I came with a couple of friends, and we ordered a bunch of stuff to share. Sharing is caring after all, ha!. Anywho, we got a thin-crust wild mushroom pizza, the BBQ chicken chopped salad, and a $30 lunch special for two (one app:  spinach-artichoke dip, two entrees: the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage pizza &amp; the Original BBQ Chicken pizza, and a dessert:  Belgian Chocolate Souffle cake).  . Everything was SO good. The Wild Mushroom and BBQ Chicken pizzas were especially delicious. I don't know how other CPK chains are, but the one in Ross Park Mall is legit. If you're looking for a good meal after shoppin' up a storm, hit this place up. This CPK is WAY better than the Cheesecake Factory next door. Trust me, you'll thank me later!  . Oh, and the service here was great!  Our waitress was super nice AND quick.","I joined a group here for dinner on a Friday night. The food was pretty good, but the service left something to be desired. . My husband and I shared the Naked City Pizza and Pizza Logs. The Pizza Logs were really good and I loved the crunchy wrapping on the outside. The pizza had a great taste and we both really enjoyed it. I was also able to taste some of the other items at the table. The Suicide Fries were great and definitely didn't hold back on the heat. This would definitely hit the spot for those that can't get enough heat. The Poutine was not that exciting and I normally really like poutine. I enjoyed the Braised Short Rib Stroganoff, great flavor. Overall, the food exceeded my expectations and I would like to try more of the menu. . The service was the worst I've had in recent memory. Maybe something was going on personally with the waitress because she had an unjustified attitude and really didn't take good care of our table. My husband and I asked for silverware since she didn't bring enough and she brought one set for the two of us. I thought maybe we were on a hidden camera prank show. Every drink at the table sat empty for most of the meal and were only refilled towards the end. She had obvious contempt for any request. . Would I return for the food? Definitely. Can I justify a return visit after the poor service? The verdict is still out.","Ordered a Hawaiian pizza, got half Hawaiian, Half Cheese, and half burnt. . They vaguely describe that their \"sandwiches\" are Calzones. They're kind of good.","When you're real hungry and not up to paying a big bill, Cici's is the place. On my last visit at this location I noticed a slight change in the texture of the pizzas. The crusts should've been cooked more, too doughy. Maybe higher heat to crisp it up. Also, couldn't eat the brownies because they difinetely needed 10 min. more in the oven, too mushy. All else, was very good, and friendly staff, clean dining area, and constant attention by manager in keeping fresh food ready.","I honestly cannot say anything bad about Costco. They run GREAT deals and definitely are about putting their customers on a high priority. I come to this Coscto in particular at least 2-3 times a month. I love that their fruits and vegetables are in a controlled temperature room and they are always stocking throughout the day. . I would recommend their pound cake, cheese cake, Kirkland all beef hot dogs, pizza from the food court, and so much more! One of the things I value the most is if you take something home and you find the quality is not good, you can bring it back and they will exchange it for you for free. One time I bought strawberries that were starting to mold. I called them and told them about it and they said to bring them back in and they would give me a new pack of fruit. They do that with all of their food. Just extremely customer friendly and helpful. I was sad to learn that the food court go rid of their ice cream bar which was very popular. Hopefully they bring it back. Their pizzas are HUGE. All pizzas are 1 size which I would measure to be XXL. They can feed up to 6-7 adults. We often call ahead of time and place a order for a full pizza so that when we get to the store, the pizza is made and ready. Much better than Pizza Hut and your other typically pizza chain. Their pizzas are amazing. . . Costco is my first choice for getting tires. They typically run a Michellin deal buy 4 tires and get $70 off. . . The accept debit cards, cash and checks. They DO NOT accept credit cards unless they are American Express. . . Love this place.","This was our date night pick before heading to the theater to see Fantastic Beasts (great movie- highly recommend). We recently were in Italy and had AMAZING pizza there, but thought this place could at least come close based on what I read. And we were right! Not quite as good as authentic Italian pizza, but pretty dang close. Wood-fired and made to order, the add-ons of prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella were worth it. The glass of wine was a little pricey for the size, but it was a nice house-red. The cannolis were nothing special, but the husband enjoyed the specialty dessert of a graham cracker cake. . I do wish they listed the size of the pizza on the menu board. We were not aware of the size and ordered 1 to split. They are small enough that 1 is a enough for one person, and we probably could have gotten our own. . I do love that they offer take-out and if I lived any closer, that could be very dangerous for my wallet with the prices they offer. . The space is a little off-putting with how small and narrow it is and they have sports tv's around the restaurant as well. I would have been okay with just the music in the background and no tv's. Takes away from the Italian ambiance.","All around great experience. We were greeted by staff welcomed and helped ordering our pizzas. Our family has been papa Murphy's take and bake customers since 1997 and we were leery of others but my wife and I agree that this summer noble Romans will be our new family favorite! The sauce was flavorful and the ingredients fresh Mgr Kevin from Indiana really was an informative touch. See ya soon guys the pizza was \"WOW\"","Good fast cas pizza. Crust was perfect wood fired. Topics are good. Grilled onions . . . Yum.","Would have never went here without the use of a Groupon. (Get yours at: http://www. groupon. com/r/uu1775957) . Used it for my wife's birthday with a group of 8. We started with a wonderful Pizza that was easily up to NYC standards (Owner Jimmy is from LI). All the starters and especially the Greek Salad had rave reviews. Cocktails were excellent and the Watermelon Sangria on special hit the spot. Everyone's entree was declared delicious with ample portions, my lasagna was outstanding and the angel hair pasta had 5 stars. The highlight of the meal was dessert with the New York Cheesecake as the star of the show. Second billing went to the very creamy and Gelatos - probably the best in the valley bar none, the Pistachio was very tasty. The prices are reasonable and the service is excellent. . On a next visit the Margarita pizza was still up to NYC standards. The Spaghetti Carbonara was perfection and left my mouth very happy. The Pasta Arrabiata was an unusual variation and spiced perfectly. Again the meal ended with the very special gelatos. It must be mentioned that Enzo's has a large and well-stocked Italian style bakery and shop next to the restaurant plus an outdoor dining area. And even the bathrooms are over-the-top.","I headed to Mercatto for dinner, to catch up with an old friend. The restaurant was busy, but mercifully not too loud. They were also playing some great music - \"Home\" by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros was a standout track. . I had the gnocchi with duck ragu, which was brilliant. It's cooked with peas, a vegetable I normally hate, but even they were absolutely delicious. My friend had a solid prosciutto pizza, and we shared a chocolate and salty caramel pudding that was also quite good - although it could have used more of the rich caramel. The evening was topped off with a perfect, foamy cappuccino. . I can't comment on the lunch rush, but I'd certainly recommend Mercatto for dinner.","I could really love @cibocalgary but won't. The food is lovely enough but the service leaves something to be desired. It's a shame the staff didn't even make mention of a Happy Hour menu for their $5 Happy Hour pizza, otherwise I would go back. But they didn't, and I won't. Not worth the price.","Maybe it had something to do with the fact that it was 1am and I'd had a few beers, but this place serves up some of the most delicious slice pizza in Toronto. It is run by a Vietnamese couple who are handle the massive amounts of foot traffic through here with diplomacy and poise. Also given the fact that a lot of said foot traffic takes place in the hours right after midnight, it makes it that much more impressive. . The slices are thin crust with a light amount of cheese. Although I enjoy a cheese heavy pizza, when it's on thin crust it's better to go with less as they have here. The sauce is very tasty and the cheese slice is kind of marguerita style without the basil leafs. But the finishing touch and what takes it from normal to what people are talking about is this garlic and herb oil they have to paint over the slice. My cousin told me about this as I would have otherwise probably just ignored it, but it takes the slice from great to 'I have lost the power of speech' in a very short amount of time. It's just phenomenal. The pepperoni slice is also good, but I'd say the nod goes to the cheese slice. . Check it out!","Total sleeper, this place is da bomb! Xlnt deep dish and New York pizza! Don't forget the garlic knots, they are wowzer! Enjoy","Came here after Buffalo Wild Wings was a 45min. wait. Wanted some good food and watch the Suns game. Ate outside, nice and toasty with the heater, very friendly staff. *****Ordered a 10\" pizza for two came with 8 slices the next size up still 8 slices just bigger slices, thin crust.","All the food was very very good, I had to ask a couple of times to get my water filled as that's all I drink. I needed the water as I had them add anchovies on my pizza. When your having anchovies, water is super important ;-)  So for me the service was just OK. I'd go back for the food tho.","The wings are not like they used to be seems like frozen cheap wings from Walmart and the prices went way up thx to new law of 10hr I've been ordering from here now for 5 years but I want be no more not worth the extra money the pizza was ok but not great like in the past","Went there with a large group which they were very accommodating the pizza was good and the staff did a great job other than a bug in a water that they apologized for definitely will stop back","Heard great things about this place so we had to check it out! Came here on a sunny afternoon and snagged a seat outside on one of the patio tables. The vibe of this place is classy but not overly stuffy. They have a gorgeous subway tiled brick oven behind the bar where they cook the pizzas. . They had a large wine menu- beer and cocktails also available. We ordered 2 red wines (wines range from $7-12ish per glass or you can buy bottles). They don't have an extensive food menu but they have small plates, pizzas and cheese &amp; meat boards available. We got the brussel sprouts &amp; pancetta which were to die for. So buttery! We also ordered the clam pizza (dough was kind of too chewy for me but pizza tasted delicious otherwise). Our servers were extremely friendly and accommodating. Definitely going to come back and try their happy hour!","I've never gone here before, but they apparently have new management as of 4/22/16. Everyone working there was friendly and one of the owners was particularly personable. The kitchen is ran by an actual cook, not some teenager lacking sanitation sensibility. I think he's from the East Coast and originally from Europe (not sure if it's Italy, Sicily or somewhere else). . The food itself was very good. They had a carryout special 16\" 2-Topping for $9. 95. I got two of those, a Super Cheesesteak hoagie and a cannoli. The pizza dough is flavorful with a good consistency and all the toppings were fresh. It did not taste greasy at all despite the pepperoni and sausage. I was also impressed with the Cheesesteak. It tasted just as good as a Capriotti's sub. I'll definitely go back there for another sub, if not another pizza. As for the cannoli, the pastry part had a good crumble to it and the filling was near perfect - sweet, but not overpowering. There's always a lot of options for pizza, Super Pizza is worth trying out. . It doesn't lose a star for anything, I just need to go back to try other items on their menu like chicken wings and fingers. If that checks out, it might be my go-to carryout place for Monday Night Football. . Sidenote: The dining area is clean but its nothing fancy or special. They don't serve beer or wine so it's not ideal for dining in.","Amazing pizza. Great Lasagna. . . and the wings are amazing as well. This place is tucked away but worth the hunt. Pizza was tossed right in front of us so we knew it was real fresh dough.","After parking in the garage across from the Dodge Theater I followed the \"Restaurant/Bar Open\" sign to Crazy Jim's. The \"bar\" part is a joke - it's a tiny counter right where you walk in the door, with about 4 stools. The restaurant has no atmosphere and the food was just so-so.  . There's quite a variety of offerings on the menu, including salads, pita wraps, subs, pizza, and entrees. However, you will quickly notice that many of the items are exactly the same with one variation, i. e. two subs with chicken and onions but one has cheese and the other has jalapenos. I asked if I could get the vegetable \"sub\" as a \"pita sub\" and was told that that just wouldn't work. So I settled on one of the chicken pitas.   . The pita itself was just fine, nothing special. I expected more of a wrap but it was served open-face and couldn't be held together so I had to use a knife and fork. The accompanying fries were disappointing - golden brown on the outside but hard/under-fried inside.  . Bottom line: Crazy Jim's is lucky it pretty much has the monopoly of pre-concert eating/drinking within walking distance of the Dodge Theater.","OG's Original Geno's is a great neighborhood spot for Pizza and Beer!! The owners are there 80% of the time and my 10 year old is always happy when he leaves. The bread and pizza is made fresh on site everyday you don't have to worry about it being old. This place is also a great place to grab a beer and watch a game.","Giordano's is a well known Chicago Restaurant that's famous for their Chicago Style Stuffed Deep Dish Pizza. They also offer Hand Stretched Thin Crust Pizza and Crispy Extra Thin Pizza. On the menu are appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pasta and more. . On Yelp I read about the long wait times so I planned to try them when they opened. At that time parking was easy and we got sat pretty much right away. We were soon greeted by our waiter who informed us that the pizzas take 45-60 minutes to prepare. . We shared an entree sized Harvest Salad. The salad contained fresh mixed greens, dried mix fruit, candied walnuts and lots of blue cheese. This salad runs on the bitter side from all the radicchio in it. . During our wait for the pizzas at least three servers besides our waiter checked on us and offered more beverages, ice for my tea and other things. I found it refreshing that the staff worked as a team and showed great hospitality. . Just like our waiter promised we received our pizzas in about 50 minutes after ordering. . I received my individual stuffed plain pizza. The pizza wasn't sliced all the way through and I found it difficult to cut a slice as the crust was xtra dense, hard and thick. Kinda like a rock. The crust was filled with a very large molten disk of blended cheese that was topped with a oregano laced tomato sauce. The very top of the crust was bitter and burnt tasting. Although I found the cheese tasty and the sauce ok in the end it was the crust that I found inedible. I don't know if the crust I received is typical of Giordano's or not. . My husband somehow ate his pizza crust and all. He said that he was glad that he wasn't hungry afterwards and yes he said the crust was awful but he ate it anyway. He did say that the sausage was much better than the lean sausage the \"Other\" Chicago place uses. . I really liked the atmosphere and I really enjoyed the well trained servers I encountered. . I would never go back for the pizza I received.","New to the area and was looking for some great pizza. . . . i found it!! Had a buffalo chicken with bacon and it was delicious! Nice, greasy, perfectly spicy and cheesy! This will be my weekly haunt for great pie!!","3. 5 to be exact. Food:. - tuna poke: very good!. - Japanese pizza: pretty good!. - furikake fries: delicious!!!!!!. - anime lasagna: looks better than its actually tastes; I expected something better than a California roll topped with a bunch of mayo. . - shoyu noodles: bland. . - iced green tea: $2 w/ free refills! awesome!!!!!. Service: . - 2 thumbs up!!! The waitresses were all very friendly and attentive. Not to mention, they were all cutely dressed in anime characters.","I have been curious about Spasso for a while now. Went for lunch last week and had a very pleasant meal there. They don't call themselves Pizza and Mozzarella bar for nothing. There is Mozzarella available on almost every dish. They have a typical Italian fare, Panini's, Pizza, meatball sandwiches. The salads looked very good as well. Let me start with the best part, The staff and service. It was very good. I sat at the bar and ordered a Pelligrino while I waited for my lunch companion to arrive. Apparently someone had failed to chill Pelligrino the night before and they only had warm bottles. They served it to me in a glass with ice but were extremely apologetic about it. Hey, I know stuff happens, I was more impressed with their genuine and sincere disappointment in the situation. The staff was extremely pleasant, helpful and courteous during my visit. The owner, Jim came by and introduced himself. I love it when they do that. . The food was also very good. We had a half pizza and Egg Plant sandwich. The Pizza we ordered included Prosciutto and it was excellent. I love italian stlle pizza with a smoky and crisp crust. This pizza was on par with Chris Bianco's pizza's. Maybe the cheese was just a little runny, but I am spitting hair's here. The Egg Plant sub was also very good.  . The wine list was small list was small but carefully chosen. You can find a large enough variety of wine too satisfy everyone in the group from what I saw by quickly glancing over the wine list. They also carried a beer that up until last week I had never tried. The Drifter Lager from Widmer Brothers brewery in Portland. I have since found it in retail store and bought myself some. Thanks Spasso for turning my onto a few beverage. . All in all, it was a very nice afternoon. I wished I could have lingered a little while to enjoy some of the other offerings. I guess I will have to go back soon to do that.","I have yet to eat here,  but next time I am out that way I will be sure to give their pizza a go. The girl next to me was sure enjoying hers. Their beer selection is excellent and the atmosphere and decorations inside would make it a great place for date night.","I had pizza from here my first night in Vegas around 2am. The pizza was excellent but after that many drinks anything tastes good at 2am. I decided to try it another time when I wasn't intoxicated and it was even better. It was so good that I am ready to call it the best pizza I ever had. I've been to Gramaldi's in Brooklyn, Lombardi's in Manhattan, Motorino in Brooklyn, Di Fara's in Brooklyn, John's on Bleeker Street, and Frank Pepe's. . . . but Five50 is #1. By the way, Frank Pepe is 2nd.","Found out about this place on Instagram and saw that a special pizza was being brought back for a one day special by pre-order only, The Kracken. I was intrigued by the black pizza dough and put in my order. The toppings included white garlic sauce, crispy calamari, peppadew, manila clams, garden greens,  purple basil, mozzarella, and pecorino all on a squid ink laced dough. . Upon first bite, I was hooked on the crispy calamari and wished that I had made a separate order. The peppadew provided a sweet heat that complimented well with the purple basil and cheeses. I wish there was more of the white garlic sauce as its flavor was masked by the toppings and did not come through. Unfortunately after two bites of each slice I was left with a large squid ink bread stick topped with mozzarella. Toppings were not generous in this case. . Overall, this pizza was a good experience. But to pay $17. 25 for this 12\" pizza just doesn't have me thrilled to come back for another. The calamari is a completely different story.  . Only 20 are available for pre-order and can be picked up on Thursday's. Keep an eye out on their social media accounts to know when they release The Kracken once more!","We order out at work every week and got their menu in the mail and gave them a try last week. Pizza, hoagies, salads and pasta dishes were ordered with no evidence leftover shortly after delivery. I had pepperoni pizza and it was delicious. Thinner crust than other places and light on the sauce, how I prefer my pizza. Coworkers who had other food items enjoyed their lunch too. Looking forward to trying other menu items!","What a gem. Had a gift certificate and we were on this side of town after a hike. Decided to try it out and boy I'm glad we did. Warm friendly greeting at the door. Nice sporty decor with an emphasis on baseball. Small town diner vibe with lots of regular patrons. Food was spectacular. We had caesar salad, garlic cheesy fries, chicken parm, and white spinach pizza. One word: YUM! Will be back for sure!","Okay the food was not good at all to much money I will never come back there are so many other Restaurant to eat Italian food better an less money I can cook better an charge less money . . The ads on line are false the pictures are nothing what you get . they show a round pizza an they give you a square what up with that . . the calamari was bad a not enough foe 15. 99 an there large cheese pizza was 22. 99 for just cheese. . Stay far a way for this place . I will never go back an I will let my friends know as well. .","I loved this place! If we go back to Vegas, we will definitely stop here. It's small, but the food was good. My fiance ordered the \"personal\" pizza, but it could have easily fed three of us!","Had this place for first time yesterday and it was great! I live down the street from Alexander's pizza and have always wanted to try it. I ordered a vegetarian pizza with light cheese I am vegan but sometimes I like to indulge on a bit of cheese. The pizza was amazing tasted freshly made and wasn't greasy at all! Very light on the stomach. I also ordered spaghetti as well and it was good nothing spectacular tasted like spaghetti. Alexander's will now be my go to pizza place!","I'm sad to write this review, because I'm actually obsessed with Caliente's Hawaiian pizza, but the service is so bad I feel that I can no longer give them my business! Every time I order I get the same thing-- and that's pretty frequent (don't judge) and every time I call and order they tell me it will be 45 minutes. . . . and every time it is late. Last time, the woman who delivered it told me they dropped it and didn't want to give me a bad product-- ok fair. But, why wouldn't you let me know that or give me some sort of discount since it was so late? If that was the only time this sort of thing happened, I would give them a pass, but they are always late and the one time I went into the actual establishment the service was slow and inattentive as well. Maybe it's a training problem. . . a hiring problem?. Pros:. +Pizza is GOOD. Cons:. -Slow inattentive service. -Slow delivery. -general lack of concern about the happiness of their patrons","Very good. I had the mahi mahi tacos. The spice is just right - little kick but not overpowering. . My friend built his own pizza. I'm not a huge fan of pizza in general but this was good.","I just moved to the area and I have ordered from this location twice. . . Both times our hand tossed pizza showed up as a thin crust! I have ordered this same pizza at our other location several times and the thickness was perfect! Our pizza was so thin that it could not even stay together on the ride over. Guess I'll try the local Papa Johns.","TERRIBLE! This was unfortunately the we worst pizza I have had in a long time! I am staying at the wonderful Andaz Resort across the street. I thought I would get a quick pizza and bring it back to the room. I am so disappointed. We are ordering from one of the large chains so we can fix our pizza craving now. Sad. . . small. . . thin. . . pitiful pizza. You will notice that I never leave bad reviews but this time I have to. Yuck!!!!! I wasted $18 plus a $2 tip!","Chips, mexican pizza and of course fajitas are great. Your clothes will definitely smell like fajitas for the rest of the day.","Yessssss, another Mayfield dive bar. . I went there with a female friend for some pre partying and something to put in my stomach before going to hang in Beachwood. Beachwood is kind of growing on me, yeah it can be snobbish and some people really take themselves way too seriously, but I still have fun. . One thing that really disappointed me was, no nurses. How the fcuk do you have bar pretty much in the middle of a hospital and there are no F'n  nurses. . Dive not as much as it used to be but still a dive bar attached to a pizza joint. . Good happy hour. . Xmas ale on draft in January. Lots of smokers outside. Good Jukebox. Not too much riff-raff. Open on Sundays. Very large bar. 2 dollar beer specials. Did not see too many Chachis. Ahh yes the makings of another dive bar!. Lets get serious now.  . The weeding soup was fantastic, lots of meatballs, shredded chicken and greens. This is the way it's supposed to be. My guest and I for sure thought it was going to be from Sysco,  nope it was homemade. . Saw a pizza come out and it looked really good. Did not eat any, but If had to bet, I would bet it was pretty good!. Next, the hot wings,  They were standard bar wings, crispy, plump and your typical Franks Red Hot Sauce flavor. Not greasy sauce. Guess what? That is the way I like them. . The service was a bit slow at  1st and they were changing shifts, but once they caught up it was all good!. The bathroom sink had just broken so they had some hand sanitizer  Sorry I can't do that stuff, period. So they let me use one of the sinks where they wash the dishes. I was completely OK with that. But I'll tell you what, I was forshizzle not going to shake one dudes hand in that place. I'm not a germ-a-phobe but I prefer good old  soap and water.","you'll notice from my review history that i'm not hard to please. maybe somewhat hard to impress into speaking in superlatives, but it takes a lot for me to leave a bad review. Looking at the other reviews for this restaurant I see a lot of \"amazings\" and equally as many 'just okays\" to \"wtfs\". . and that's really all it is. this place is debilitatingly inconsistent. . I've been here several times and the food is definitely overpriced but it's always been okay (neither exceptional nor offensive 'italian' fare), and the service is always lovely (thats what the points are for in this review). . . Went on NYE for dinner (table of four) and I know what youre thinking \"it's a busy holiday, cut them some slack!\". No. I've been there on busier fridays, and there's just no excuse for what was getting churned out of the kitchen. the wait staff is not to blame, i am entirely blaming the kitchen (and didnt undertip to punish the wait staff who were not to blame). let's just get to the shitshow. . arancini and lamb meatballs were fine. The lamb (i love lamb, so it's not like i can't \"handle\" the gamey taste) was not fresh. Arancini is very hard to screw up, and they didn't. Neither is worth the 15 dollar price tag ( 4 arancinis in some forgettable sauce, and 7 lamb meatballs that were smaller than a teaspoon. . baffling). . Now at this point of the meal i was pretty happy because it's NYE, i was with my friends, and the ambiance and wait staff were killing it. it was overpriced but average food, which is what I already knew about this place. . the mains is where they completely lost us. our friend's pasta was good. It wasn't 25 dollar good, but it was a comfort dish (I know i keep bringing up the price but i eat at this price point frequently and it was more like a 15/person quality of food). . the two pizzas were both dry and not well seasoned (pear pizza and the one with mulitple meats) and the special, bison cheek (which is one of my favorite meats) was literally inedible. I always take a takeout box, i literally left my entire meal at the table in the box except the polenta which i ate, and the few bites of bison snd greens that were in my belly. . The biscuit was inedibly dry (and I mean that, I love bread and will even eat stale bread, this biscuit was burnt and heavily over salted. . . which is something a salt lover like me has never said). the bison cheek was cooked well in terms of doneness but the marinade was horrific. it was very sweet (I like a mix of sweet/meat so it isn't that i'm not adventurous), the greens were underseasoned and seemed old (maybe just overcooked). I had to cut the outsides of the bison off to at least try and eat the meat less affected by the sugar they must've marinaded it in, but. . . . it was too far in. It was permeated into the entire chunk of meat and that bummed me out because i was famished and had saved up for this meal. very hard to screw up bison for me, but they did. i ate the polenta (hard to screw up, and they didnt) that hadn't touched the sugar meat and that was basically my meal, plus a teaspoon meatball and an arancini. . \"Well Ayla, why didn't you tell them at the restaurant instead of being an asshole on the inernet\". Great question, Internet! The time between the first entree being dropped (mine) and the last (pasta) was almost 25 minutes, and the time between our appetizers being cleared and my entree being dropped was over 20 minutes as well. Now, we were in no rush as it's NYE, but we had sat and ordered by half 8 and were not out by 11, it was ridiculous. it was not even crowded and it is not the wait staff's fault. The expo or someone in the kitchen was being a stone cold disaster (I used to work on a kitchen line, you know when the mess ups is from front or back of house). . Since it had been about 40 minutes between cleared apps and my friend getting her pasta, they should have refired the rest of our entrees or at least kept them warm. no, they dropped one plate, then dropped two pizzas, and the pasta with 5ish minutes or so between each of those things. It was baffling. the prospect of them firing up another shit meal for me after 40 minutes of not eating anything (rude to start eating until everyone has their plates when your party is only 4), i wasn't going to risk it i just wanted to dip ASAP and never return. . It sucks too because the wait staff, ambiance, and the menu on paper are so awesome, and this place is like two blocks from where I live. further, the presentation is lways great, but the food underneath it absolutely blekh. I don't see myself hemorrhaging my hard earned cash on this place ever again. In a town with so, so many amazing culinary options i will never understand how the hell this place stays open in such a prime location. they need to elevate the quality of their food to justify the price, or hopefully they'll be gone by the end of the year. i've given it so many chances and Saturday was just the straw that broke the camel's back.","Very trendy place! Great vibes, servers are all very fun and friendly. Place is very modern yet rustic. The applies, pizza and dolces are amazing!!!!! A bit noisy but overall a fun place to meet up with friends.","Just ordered and holy smokes I've never seen the delivery time like this one, 65 to 75 minutes. wow they need to step their game because this is becoming not worth the wait at all not to mention it's a hit or miss if the pizzas cooked good or not disappointed","I'd give it a solid 3 for the pizza slice lunch special, but my wife's egg salad sandwich was so good, I bumped it to a 4.","Stopped in for dinner on August 1, space at the bar and tables but they were doing a decent business because you can also buy pizza by the slice and it appeared you could get it for take out which was odd to see in a casino. . Anyway, they have a great beer selection, about 13 taps of all varieties, some national brands but a lot of regional beers. The salads are good portion sizes but the thing that I really enjoyed was what they called Pigs &amp; Truffles. This was a shredded pork cannelloni on top of spinach in b\u00e9chamel sauce with some truffles on top. The shredded pork in cannelloni was awesome, I love cannelloni but it usually comes with ground meats, not shredded. The pork wasn't dry at all and had a nice texture to it. The spinach had a bit of a peppery taste to it and it mixed very well with the creamy b\u00e9chamel sauce. . The place has only been opened about two month and is buried back near the sports book at the aria but if you are there, give it a shot.","Grabbed takeout from Nook Kitchen during a business trip &amp; decided to order the Mushroom Pizza &amp; Beet salad. Asked if they could make the salad veggie (since it came w/ bacon plus a bacon-vinaigrette &amp; they happily obliged. Subbed the dressing for a blood orange balsamic which was a wonderful option. The salad was mostly arugula - there were very few beets &amp; goat cheese dollops. So for a standard salad this was okay but guess I'd been expecting thick slices of beets w/ just a little frisee. The pizza was wood fired &amp; had a nice crisp crust. Lots of mushrooms - decent but prob would look elsewhere for dinner in the future. This was okay but would not consider it a destination spot when in the area","The  food was great , we had a Margharita pizza, the shrimp risotto and the braised pork chops with gnocchi!. Unfortunately it is a very busy place so extremely noisy and waiters can take some time to bring your drinks/food. . Worth to go for the food and low price, but would recommend for parties of 4+ that want more of a good place to start the party night than a cosy diner.","So thrilled that they finally opened up another location in none other than a perfect location in the Entertainment District (John and Richmond). This location is bigger, has more seating space, and has two ovens so you can get more pizzas in and out a lot quicker. We ordered the custom pizza for $12. 83 because we like the unlimited amount of toppings that you can put on it. More bang for your buck and you can load up as much as you want! There are a variety of toppings to choose from and they are so fresh! My go-to is the class pizza sauce with pesto dressing on the crust. Try it! So good! Come here if you want freshly baked wood oven pizza.","This will be my last time here. Pizza is full of a ton of grease. The guys who make the pizza use their bare hands, then toggle back and forth to the cash register. Last night my pizza was just a puddle of grease, its not even edible. Their prices are outrageously expensive for the quality. Its the closest to my house but i think the pizza at the 7-11 is better quality now. This place has really gone down the tubes. Its just not what it used to be. A friend told me the one on S. Buffalo is the real Roccos to go. Something about a bad break up between then two guys. I also spent 18 bux on a veal parm sub. Seems a little pricey for the sub. It was good but not 18 dollar worth good. Their pizza is just a greasefest. It must just be really low end cheese to create that. My recommendation would be to go to Bambinos or East side for quality pizza. If you want really low end stuff that is over priced, come here and get some pizza that just sits out all day.","I had the wild boar bacon pizza and it was delicous!! My friend had the gnocchi and it was average, nothing special! I would definitely go back for their 5$ pizza sometime! Service was good and food didn't take too long. Overall great place and really cool atmosphere :)","So. . . I live a couple blocks and have been waiting for months to have this place open. Finally went over on Friday night and had an enjoyable meal there. The space is awesome and set up well. Cool little back patio, lots of tvs for games, multiple bars. . The good- the food is solid and they have an interesting menu that makes me hope once execution is dailed in will be very good. The pizzas are ok as are the apps. They add to many toppings for such thin pizza and as a result some come out soggy. This can easily be corrected and I'll leave it up to first week, but if it's like that again. No bueno. . . the Shrimp with Wasabi cotton candy and the bacon wrapped chicken pieces were solid. You can tell they are getting going, but food is pretty good, could be awesome if executed better as mentioned before on here, hope that comes with time. The food is a bit overpriced, but expected considering the design and the market they are going for in the neighborhood. The bad-The beer is downright awful. Not just a single beer is bad, but the whole assortment is bad. . . not just passable bad, like undrinkable bad. Best brewery in Charlotte? Remind me never to listen to these people's opinion on beer. If you are going for beer skip this place and go to NoDa brewing where they have a capable and talented brewmaster not some hack making watered down, flat, awful beer as if he just bought a Mr. Beer kit on the internet and boiled  a starter kit at home. . You know it's not good when your whole table has either 1 beer or a sampler then each person either doesn't finish the beer and orders an alcohol drink or wine. We left a couple half pints and multiple sampler glasses half full after the first drink order. Still shocked at how awful this place is when it comes to beer. Really deporable they call themselves a brewery.  . I'd give them 1 or 2 stars if basing solely on the beer, but the food and hopes for what it can be as a new establishment garner 3. If i go again in a week or so and similiar mistakes are made with food, forget about it even with it being down the street I'll avoid. I don't know who hired the brew master, but they need to seriously drop the guy or they'll suffer as other's I've spoken to who have been have had similiar feelings. Just really amateurish beer for a brewery restaurant selling beers at 4. 50 and 5 bucks. . Anyway, I'll certainly head by for drink or lunch from time to time. Not a chance in hell I ever order a beer of theirs again until I hear they have a new brewmaster who is capable of putting out a drinkable beverage.","Our first time here , the owner was very friendly and helpful and the pizza was great, we ordered the mushroom pizza simple yet flavorful. Will come back again !","Exactly the kind of pizza we were after. . Think they call it East Coast style. . Finding a sit down pizza restaurant was harder than expected in Vegas so we had to pay a small premium. The beer selection is also good so can't really think of any reason to not give it 5 stars. . We had the Margherita and a the Gotham.","Great salads, best pizza in Shadyside and a better menu than ever. . Would be 5 star if they cleaned their tap lines. The beer list is awesome but the beer is ruined by the off taste. . I love the atmosphere, the staff, the selection and food, but a place that has such good beer needs to clean the lines.","Sometimes people give this place a bad rap. I mean, it's a neighborhood bar, so it's what I'd expect going in. As with any local establishment, the regulars get preferential treatment. It happens, get over it. Late night and on the weekends it can get crowded. And yes, they do allow smoking which is the main reason one star is deducted. . Shenanigans has a full bar and numerous beers on tap. They have great daily food specials. I've tried several menu items and it's always been good and what I would consider above average for bar food. Good burgers, good pizza. Surprisingly good quesadilla. Tons of wing flavors. And you can't really mess up fries when you pile cheese and bacon on top. . The service can be slow. But they are usually pretty busy and as long as my waitress or bartender keeps liquid in my glass, I don't mind waiting for food.","Very pleased with our wood-fired pizza, and the Humble Pie dessert was definitely the perfect ending!  The place was a bit noisy which made conversation a little difficult. . . . so go for good food, not an intimate chat ;D","Hands down the best marinara I've ever had. We ordered the meat lovers pizza and the toppings were high quality and quantity. The cheese sticks were outstanding of course with that marinara sauce. Garlic parmesan fries were also on point. Only disappointment was the super long delivery time. Would definitely eat there again but probably dine in rather than wait on delivery.","I have now been to Pop Up Pizza twice now and I have only good things to say about my experiences. The first time I came in and ordered a simple slice of pizza by myself after walking through the Fremont Experience. I ended up meeting the manager who embraced me in a quality conversation and made me feel as though I was at home with a friend enjoying some wonderful pizza. The second time I came, i brought a friend of mine to see what he thought. He ended up ordering 3 different types of pizza and loved all of them. Best part about the second experience was that the manager approached me and remembered my name. I was very impressed and will continue to make it a point to stop by every time I am downtown!","Decent laid-back atmosphere with a nice menu selection. Enjoyed the casual brewery-esque deco &amp; the spacious, open layout where it did not feel too crowded and there was decent space between tables/parties. Tv screens mounted frequently throughout &amp; with non-neck-straining views if one is interested in whatever viewing attraction is displayed (sports). Complaint: music level. Too loud to easily hear or carry on a conversation. Had to literally speak an octave higher (slightly shout) to converse with someone less than 3 feet away. Turn it down a notch so one can hear their company, not to mention the staff! . I don't enjoy beer. But my friend really enjoyed one of the house brews on special. Seems the beer is what brings people back, because the food was filling enough, at best. Somewhat unique- but nothing I would intentionally be eager to return for. . After learning most everything on the menu including pickles means SWEET pickles (I don't mind them- but many do), that narrowed selection down for my friend, who really wanted the fish &amp; chips. Their house made tartar is sweet- sorry, but even I cannot get on board with that. A TRUE tartar contains dill. So he went with the salmon filet on a bed of some sort of emphasized rice pilaf. I think we got stuck on our waitress asking \"how did you want that cooked?\" . . . Uhm- it is FISH!!! What do you mean, HOW?! We were both miffed &amp; managed to say, \"please make sure it is done- as in cooked. \" Fish is NOT steak!!! You go to a SUSHI restaurant for \"rare\" fish! . Needless to say- the plate came out &amp; it was a portion less than what you'd receive paying $50+ a plate at a 5 star establishment for \"gourmet\". . . the filet was less than 4oz on a 1/4 cup amount of rice. Friend said the rice had 0 flavor. The 5 sprigs of \"steamed\" asparagus was like chewing on wood (I heard the crunch over the loud music) &amp; the salmon was about the best part- but only the crust contained flavor while the rest flaked pretty bland. And this was \"worth\" $17. . We had high hopes in the unique 'Brussels &amp; Bacon' pizza I ordered. I wanted the fish tacos- but they only are served as an appetizer. Was not going to pay $12 for that then have to fork out an extra $2-3 for a side. Make it a meal. People who want tacos want more than a \"bite\". And I'm from Alaska- so don't pass it off with price as 'Alaskan Cod' when we know cod is bottom of the barrel, even in Alaska, where salmon &amp; halibut are the true picks. Nothing about cod makes it more special, and Alaska is offended you use it's name to price gouge mediocre fish we don't even claim to fame. . The pizza did not disappoint. Generous amount of Brussels. But the bacon was pretty weak. Corn was of plenty- I love corn- but paid for bacon on the pizza, not cheap corn as a filler. Crust was on par &amp; pretty much made it, as overall, the flavor was a bit bland. But, that is what happens when you skimp on the salted bacon that is supposed to round out the dish &amp; flavor. . I passed on desert- but had a bite of the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e my friend ordered. The waitress, while she was attentive &amp; tried very hard- could not remember which version of the desert was on the menu. We were told it was supposed to be strawberry. Thought it tasted funny &amp; was rather brown. . . to find out it was actually some rendition of a chocolate almond or something along the lines of what tasted \"burnt\", in my opinion. I passed after one bite. Friend was not too thrilled but ate it. Waitress apologized- but I guess it was a little disappointing not being provided the correct menu when choosing &amp; spending was not the greatest way to end the experience. . I would give it a second chance. There are other items/beverages I would like to try that have piqued my interest. And I really did enjoy the atmosphere &amp; close location- seems like there is more potential to be discovered. And I will add- I sincerely appreciate a place that offers samples of their beers before having to order &amp; not know! Excellent in offering samples of their brews- and they also seem to have excellent knowledge. I found it pretty cool to see a peek inside the brewery in the back upon entering/exiting on the side of the building where there are glass windows to the brew room.","Good bar around the corner for happy hour and sporting events. I love when they combine the 4 TVs in the center into one large TV for football games. We enjoy the wings and pizza, the cold beer and zipparitas (frozen margaritas that pack a punch, so there is a maximum amount you can order haha).","The pizza was as good as my Chicago friends advertised. Super cheesy and the crust was on point. Service was good too. It was clean and the atmosphere was friendly and inviting. I will be eating there again.","It surprises me what celebrity chefs are willing to put their name on. Riva is a poolside (all outdoor) restaurant at The Venetian. We went here for lunch and I was completely underwhelmed by the choices on the menu and by the food itself. Really? This is what a celebrity chef comes up with? Sad. . Very few choices so you better want a pizza, a club sandwich, or a standard salad. That's it. My daughter had the cheese pizza. I had the club sandwich, which came with fries. And I got a strawberry colada swirl. $60 later, we called that a lunch and left. I could have gotten that anywhere. Why on earth would that be what Wolfgang Puck offered up? Seems crazy to me. . If you want to overspend on something you can get better at your local diner. . . come here.","I went here for dinner for a friends birthday. We sat upstairs at the rooftop bar. The ambiance was really awesome. It's small, but luckily for us it wasn't crowded. I ordered their special, crab stuffed portobello for an appetizer and bruschetta flatbread for the main course. The portobello was a little disappointing. The portion was small and it was $12, so we expected it to be much bigger. The flatbread, however was delicious. It was one of the best flatbread pizzas I've ever had. . I will definitely keep this place in mind for dinner more often.","Great pizza and a great beer selection. Big improvement in service over the brickyard (R. I. P)","The place is supposed to be known for tacos. But the tacos are average at best, and no better than what you could get your local Chili's or other commercialized Mexican joint (yes, I am aware that this is Latin American--not Mexican--food). The biggest problem that I have is with the tortilla shell. While most people like to fixate on the protein and the toppings (similar with sushi), it's the backbone of the dish (i. e. tortilla shell and sushi rice) that is most important. And, it is clear that the tortilla shells simply came from a bag from some commercial plant--bland, chewy, gummy, and sad. Once you've had a real, homemade tortilla shell, there is no going back. I expected better from a place that has \"tacos\" in its name. . Moving on the toppings, which I can only assume was meant to be the star of the show. We tried 7 varieties: BBQ Pork, Rio Style Chicken, Chipotle Mushroom, Chicken Tinga, Roasted Pork Al Pastor, Chorizo &amp; Potato, and Lamb Barbacoa. Some things I noted: the pork had been cooked to death with inadequate seasoning (lathering on sauce is not a remedy as I'm sure we all know from a pot roast blunder or two); the slaw on the al pastor was extremely wet and I had a mushy, wet taco in my hands by the time I got to it; it was unclear whether the slaw on the al pastor or lime crema on the lamb barbacoa had been tasted by anyone and adjusted for seasoning before it was served because the sour element was overwhelming and not balanced whatsover.  . We also had the chicken empanadas as an appetizer. First of all, they were not empanadas--the flaky half-moon pastries that we're all used too. The waitress was spot on with her description:  they tasted and had the consistency of essentially pizza rolls. So if you like pizza rolls, I guess they are fine. . Finally, the hostess was terrible. I approached her to request a table for 2 on a Sunday around 2:30 P. M. We then sat down at the high-top bar tables (where other people waiting for a seat were also sitting) at the spot closest to her and literally right in front of her. We watched 4 other parties who had arrived after us be seated before we asked what was going on. Turns out that she had crossed our names off the list because she thought we had gone to the bar. No apology, just a blank stare. . I didn't try any of the drinks and don't intend to. $8 for a Dark n' Stormy is amusing; that's halfway to an entire bottle of Gosling's rum, and then I could have endless Darn n' Stormys for a month. . Authentic is definitely not the name of the game. At the end of the day, you're basically paying for the modern decor, hip music, cute font on the menus, and a \"safe\" place to eat with your co-workers. I'll stick with my $1-2 authentic tacos at Taco Bajaa Fresh over on Copley Drive on my own time though.","My husband and I are big Restaurant Impossible fans. We live across town but have been wanting to visit this place since we saw the episode and it is the only location the show has filmed that was even remotely close to where we live. We were greeted as soon as we entered and given our choice of seating. Initially, when we watched the show I remember thinking it looked better before the renovation but the decor was very nice. Our server had a great personality and chatted with us a bit, smiling the whole time. We ordered the Italian Meat Plate. It was so big we could of had just that for dinner! It was seriously an appetizer built for 6. I had the Veal Piccata with a side of vegetables. You could tell the vegetables were fresh not frozen. My husband had a pizza. At first I thought maybe we should send it back so the cheese could be melted better but when I tasted it I understood why they served it that way. It was really fresh and light and I really got a taste of all the ingredients. At the end of the meal, Maria came out to ask us how everything was. We were very happy to report we loved everything! We even thought the prices were very reasonable, especially compared to the portions. In the past, we've been disappointed by restaurants that the \"magic of television\" has coaxed us into trying but not this time. If we didn't love so far away we'd definitely go back. Oh and I forgot to mention, if you buy a bottle of wine and don't finish it you can take it home with you. What a great perk!","I'm not sure exactly how we found this place but my boyfriend and I were on a hunt for a new date spot. He mentioned Chicago style pizza, which I've never had. Got there and the waitress was super friendly and so were the other staff that were there. The menu states to allow 45 minutes for it to cook. I don't know if it was just me or the conversation we were having but it did not seem like 45 minutes. It got to our table at a reasonable amount of time. We ordered the small, which included 8 HUGE slices. I was satisfied with one and I must say we were both very pleased with everything. The sauce was tasty, cheese was melty, crust was soft and crispy, and overall the pizza was amazing. This will definitely now be our to-go pizza joint.","Went here with a large group for dinner on a Saturday night. They were very accommodating and served us all around the same time. I ordered the chicken salad which was fantastic! I portion is very large - I had enough to take home for lunch the next day. The only reason I give it 4/5 stars instead of 5 is that I didn't find the pizza that great. I tried a few bites of someone else's and it was too greasy and not crisp enough for my liking. Otherwise, I do plan to go back to Cibo to enjoy one of their drink/wine specials !","This is a relatively new restaurant, so I'm cutting some slack for a few things that are usually related to \"growing pains\" and will probably sort themselves out. . Residents of East Mesa are eager to have some nice dining options and I think Osteria has potential. We had the meatball appetizer (which was amazing) and the Pesto, Ravioli, bolognese, and salsiccia (mushroom pizza). All the food was really good. We did request a side of red sauce for the ravioli as it is not served with red sauce. You can taste that the food is made from scratch and everything was really good. The pizza could have used another minute to crisp the crust a bit more, but was flavorful and delicious. The wine list is fairly good and the bread and EVOO is good. We requested balsamic to go along with it and they accommodated our request.  . The service on our second visit was better than the first. I would request that the servers not refer to me as honey or sweetie. Others might not overlook this as easily. . I hope that Osteria will continue to work out the kinks. This is a pricey restaurant for the east valley and although many EV residents are willing to pay for a nice dinner, they will expect great service and food. I'm hoping that Osteria will expand their limited menu to include a few more seafood and meat selections.","Went to Greenhouse for lunch after getting a recommendation on facebook from Michael Symon. We ordered the Siracha(sp?) wrap w/ chickpeas and the french bread pizza. It was clear that Greenhouse uses seasonal and local ingredients, which accounts for the way their food tastes. The veggie wrap was good, but lacked the spiciness I was expecting. As far as vegetarian dishes go, I wasn't overly impressed. The french bread pizza, however, stole the show. The baguette it was baked on was crusty and fresh. The cheese it was topped with was perfectly melted and the heirloom tomatoes on it were gorgeous as well as delicious. I forgot to mention that the salads that accompanied these dishes were amazing. Light, fresh &amp; with great dressing. If I am in the area again, I will be curious to come back and see how the menu has changed!","Ok pizzaria in Dorval if you like a wimpy pizza, their dressing is very decent and flavor wise its eatable. They also habe pretty good prices compared to others in the area.","One thing I really love about Cibo is their Pizza Happy Hour, 3-5pm weekdays. . If you are keen on an early dinner, and tight in the budget department, this can make for a excellent/thrifty start to any evening or date. . They have a happy hour menu which features a selection of more stripped-down offerings of some of their standard pizzas, each one for only $5. FIVE. BUCKS. That's the cost of a cardboard disc with melted Ken &amp; Barbie dolls from Little Caesar's, for cryin' out loud! . It is a KILLER deal considering the deliciousness of their pizza. Their website boasts, \"the best pizza crust in the city, \" and I have to admit, it is quite good. Thin, but not to thin; chewy, but not too chewy; delightfully greasy, but not too greasy. . They also offer drink specials like a $5, 5 oz. Valpolicella. Not bad. . The interior is tastefully decorated, nice and cozy. . The service is very friendly. Even accommodating to the cabalone that wanders in in 15 minutes before 5:00 hoping to still catch happy hour. Just be sure to tip a little extra if you're getting a good deal during happy hour. That delicious pizza would normally cost upwards of $15, so don't let your good fortune be your kind server's loss!","I wanna like this place more. Fairly priced, good (not great tho) pizza. But the delivery times are sooo bad. Worst I've ever experienced anywhere. They are always and forever late. And for the life of me, I can't understand why they can't keep up. Every other pizza place can have it all done and delivered in an hour. I've even ordered sandwiches and waited for more than an hour and a half! How is the bad delivery the only thing consistent?? Fix it!","Delicious again. . We always order the Fritto Misto + side of their housemade marinara. . This mixture of calamari &amp; rock shrimp is delicious and the marinara is IMHO much better for dipping than the sauce that comes with the dish.   . This time we ordered the 14\" original crust Classic European pizza add meatball (DO THIS!). Turns out meatball was a fantastic choice and really augmented the rich flavor of this already-delicious pizza.  . We also ordered the 12\" thin crust Wood Fired Yukon Gold + egg pizza to try something new. It was good but I'd like it better if the whole thing had egg on it instead of just the center. Kind of reminded us of breakfast. Glad we tried it but will probably go back to our favorite Pavone Pepperoni again next time. . One daughter ordered an 8\" Pesto Bianca pizza as well. She let me have a piece and I'll say it was really, really good. That pesto and the sundried tomato they put on there is really tasty!   I'd order this again but watch out for those nut allergies - the pesto is walnut based.  . Another satisfying visit to Nello's!","I have been earing at many Ruth Chris Steak House restaurants for years and this is absolutely the first time that i got very disappointed. . Not about food. Honestly food was great except the soop(marinara souce and  something in side but very salty and taste like a cheap pizza souce . Other than soop Everything was as great as at all Ruth Chris steak houses. . But ; i am not sure why but there were many tables around our table that full of many glasses on them. During our dinner , Couple of servers were drying them with their towels or what ever they had in their hands. . Very unprofessional and distracting. Why they cannot wait until closure. Or if they have to prepare the tables why they can do this in an other way . Anyway it was a very interesting experience anyway . I don't remember our servers name and she was also great too. I will probably come back to give another chance . I moved to Pittsburgh area recently feom Mclean, Virginia and this is the only Ruth Chris around","I had such an awful experience. I've never been here before or had their food. I ordered through the phone for pick up. I was rushed to get my order in and the lady tried to hang up on me before I could even ask for the total amount (since I don't know the total with tax). . I went by to pick the order, was greeted fine. I tell this balding older man I'm here for a pick up. He asks, \"The two pizzas?\" I said yes with a salad. He then cuts me off mid sentence to say, \"yeah yeah whatever. \" He goes to the back to get the salad so I look through the menu one more time and he comes back to tell me, \"move where I can see you. \" . I will never come here again. This serve was down right awful and what made it worse, I was with my 6yr old brother and he had to sit through and listen to this. The pizza is not even that good!","Oh no, Joe! . Here's the problem:. 1. You need to do something about the ridiculous line out the door. Yes, you are popular. Yes it was dinner time (on a Thursday night. ) So why was there only one person taking orders? You have two registers. Heard numerous complaints during my 30 minute wait. . 2.  if someone orders the havarti pesto burger, please include the pesto.  even if the person orders it without the bun. You could put it in a condiment cup. . 3. When you're making kids food, please be aware that kids are some of the pickiest diners out there and unhappy kids = unhappy parents. The kids grilled cheese came out with some red sauce on the cheese part.  not just a little. Therefore kids refused to eat. Perhaps it was pizza sauce? BBQ sauce? Whatever it was, it shouldn't have been there. That's $10 down the drain. Yes, two kids meals which were 1/2 a grilled cheese sandwich each were $5. And, mommy, who went out to avoid having to cook after a long day had to go home and prepare something. . 4. What's the story with the flies? Well, of course they are expected at an outdoor place, but our table was literally swarming with them. I noticed that the tables under the trees did not have patrons vigorously swatting these pesky creatures away. This isn't really a complaint, just a heads up to future guests to suss out the tables before you sit down. . 5. What do you do best? I want to give you one more chance as my mom's group loves to 'lunch' here, but I just haven't discovered the magical menu item. My husband said he's come for the last time, so I'm on my own. I've had the sandwiches and pizzas and nothing stands out.  . A couple positives to end my review:. When I went back in to get my pesto, the guy who got it for me was super friendly. . Food comes out quickly once it's ordered. . Cool bathroom. . One final piece of advice - sit on the side away from the street. We learned this the hard way as it was a nuisance to continuously walk around the building for drink refills, taking kids to the bathroom, utensils, condiments, picking up food, etc.","The location it's very smart and beautiful. It's on the heart of Las Vegas strip. . The appetizers where really good. The Caprese  salad and the spinach pizza where tasteful. The selection of wines very well chosen and the prices are fair. The variety of breads delicious. . My spaghetti was well seasoned but the portion was ridiculously small!. Service good and professional. The worst part of the restaurant are the hostess who are not knowledgable and far of being nice. Very impersonal.","YAY - Pittsburghers rejoice!  Finally a place to replace Pizza Sola/NY style in Pittsburgh. . We stopped in on a random Wednesday at around 3PM to try them out and grab a quick slice. We ordered a basic pepperoni which was really good. Is it the best pizza I've ever had in my life? No.  Is it high on my list of a basically non-existent NY style market in Pittsburgh? Absolutely. The service was great, chill guys working hard that really want to see the place succeed. I will happily be back (probably at least once a week) to continue to support them!. Pro-tip: Don't be dissuaded by the $5ish slice prices, these slices are HUGE and totally worth it.","Great pizza, made fresh. Chicken parmesan is awesome. The stromboli is great also. His red sauce is awesome, great local place to dine in or take out.","Had a child's birthday party there yesterday, wonderful facility, clean environment, great DJ spinning tunes, and the staff was quite attentive and kept each party moving along. The pizza was good and hot, pitchers of lemonade on the table was never empty!","We had the calamari and it was cooked perfectly. I highly suggest ordering it. . The chef opened the restaurant for us before dinner and invited us over after telling us the neighboring restaurant closed last week. . We had the bolognese which was on point, a pizza, and carbonara which I asked for off the menu. . The pizza was thin crust and very tasty. The carbonara was great and hopefully they will add it to the menu for more to try. . Price range was around $20 per plate and we had plenty of leftovers after sharing. . The owner also sat down and spoke with us for a bit then gave us a few samples of their desserts.","I ordered the Salsiccia, but replaced the mushrooms with roasted peppers. It was exceptional. . My wife ordered the Contradina with sausage. She loved it. . Nutella pizza was good, but by the time it made it to the table, it was cold. . .  . Focaccia bread with olive oil was good, but a bit bland. . It's a bit pricy for a small pizza, but you can't get 90 second pizza like this in many places. It's well worth a look in the Madison area.","Best woodfire pizza in CU so far!!! Excellent service and always piping hot, made to eat.","Visited this place for dinner tonight. . . . . NY Pizza gets 4 stars because they are true to their name. The pizza is exactly as what we have in NY.  The only small difference is in the crust. These guy's crust is thinner than the regular crust of NY pizza, but other than that, this is NY pizza if I've ever had any. . I bought a a 14' plain chees pie, some buffalo wings and a 2 liter bottle of coke and paid $14 for it. The food was good and so was the price. . Thanks to the yelpers for pointing this one out!!","NOT WHAT THEY USED TO BE!  We havent been there in about a 1. 5 and decided since we used to go there frequenty- we would go back w/ my Dad in town. Walked in, the decor and the ambiance went from what used to be cool, chic, edgy- to lame calm restaurant. The waiter had no personality- I asked him \"Is the place still as good as it used to be?\" his resonse -walked away. OK. . Now onto the food. . . Ordered oysters and another appetizer (lobster poutine which was DELISH) and 2 main dishes. They served us everything together! REALLY?! What happened to apps come first then dinner? . Best part was we had a variety of oysters- the ones from BC ended up being super fishy. The waiter replied \" Oh yes i HATE those too\". So why not tell us that before we ordered them?! Thanks a lot for nothing! . The gnocchi in a meat sauce was absolutly disgusting- it was like chineese beef dish sauce and a few random tiny gnocci floating around.  . Sad to say if your a real foodie like we are- who go out multiple times a week. . avoid this place. . Came home and ordered a pizza!  Sorry Chuck- shame.","Best pizza in Madison! I know that's bold, especially coming from a Ian's and Glass Nickle lover, but the simplicity, flavor, and freshness makes this the best pizza in madison. I make a special trip from Lodi for this pizza. . The staff are all awesome too, especially the lady who's the main waitress who works like 7 days a week there, she's awesome!. Get the pesto, add sausage, to die for! Don't forget to use their punch card system, they don't advertise it, but after you try their pizza, you'll be at 10 punches in no time!","So I found this place on accident while I was out dicking around looking for a Pok\u00e9mon stop (don't judge me). . I had seen it pop up on my yelp results in the past when I searched for pizza, but since it's not visible from the street, I guess I never bothered to look for it. . Well, there it was right in front of me and I figured, \"Guess it's about time I give you a go\". So I ordered from my phone and proceeded to go find the Pok\u00e9mon stop. . I came back around about 15 mins later and picked up my pizza. The minute I opened the box, I was thinking, \"oh shit. This is gonna be good!\". And it was! 18\" cheese pizza at its best (by west coast standards). By far the best pizza on this side of town. But then I realized that the true taste test has yet to come. . . Will it still taste good in the morning? It passed my \"morning after\" taste test. . Very pleased so I'll be there very soon. Great pizza!","I saw this place on diners. Drive-ins, and dives hoping to get the bbq chicken pizza. Unfortunately they didn't offer it that day so settled on the ahi sandwich and zucchini fries. By far the best fried zucchini whatever I have ever had! My friend got bbq chicken salad and fried green beans. They were pretty good. You can tell the quality of ingredients is something you don't get at a typical restaurant.","I can't believe Caliente only has 3 stars! They have one of the best happy hours in Pittsburgh: half off craft drafts and $5 one-topping personal pizzas from 4:30-630pm weekdays. They have also have daily beer specials. This is definitely a craft beer lover's paradise. They have the most unique selection of brews in the Burgh. They support local breweries by keeping them in tap and collaborating on brews and events. They also serve beers that are seemingly nowhere else in town. The pizza and calzones are delicious, but that's the extent of food that I've tried. One woman who works there is miserable (I've never seen her smile), but she is an exception to the rule. . With the great beer, pizza, and deals, I will keep coming back.","Pretty good place to grab a pizza and a peanut butter belching beaver stout. The pizzas are so big that you should definitely bring someone to share with. Price is really decent.","My in-laws recommended this restaurant. My husband and I, though, felt a bit disappointed in the food. The pizza tasted a just-OK 3 stars. The salad was 99% iceberg lettuce and had only a few pieces of cucumber and tomato. My husband ended up going into our refrigerator and cabinet to find additional toppings for the salad. We give the salad 1 star. The Italian sandwich tasted a good 4 stars. I guess that the overall average would be about a 3.","pizza, veal sandwich, seafood platter all are hard to beat, great selection, prices reasonable","The food was very delicious. I had a clam pasta and a prosciutto pizza. Both were delicious. I'll have to come here again!","Quick review:  Food:  delicious. Service:  Poor. SLOW.  . Five of us tried Lucille today for lunch. We were seated quickly and served our drinks relatively quickly. But, we waited well over an hour and a half for our food. Lunch should not take nearly two hours. Patrons will not go here for lunch if they think it will take more than an hour.  . Our wait staff seemed inexperienced. PLEASE train the staff before you open. . Our party had both the Detroit panned pizza and the Neapolitan wood-fired pizza, the lunch pizza. We all enjoyed the salad that comes with the lunch. Not quite to the standards of Pizza Brutta, but very good. Pizza and a very good salad for $10 is a great value.  . I know the place is new and I will try again. But, service needs major improvement. I really want to like this place.","Great service and great pizza! Came here with my uncle and mom for a late dinner and it was pretty good! Sat at the bar and the bartender Jill was very personable and took of everything that we needed. If I were ever back in the area, I would definitely come back here again!","We had a menu shoved under our door. So we only thought to look at it. Wished we had looked at Yelp first. . 1) ordered the special: 2x 1 topping pizzas. We ordered pepperoni and pepperoni. We received one sausage and one pepperoni. . 2) we ordered cheese bread: it was ok. Nothing amazing, a more flat pizza crust than pudgier bread sticks. . 3). We ordered fried mushrooms. These were pretty good. We received 11 in the order. . 4) we were not eligible for the free soda because we had ordered a special (which sucks. . 5) we ordered a 2 L of Diet Coke and a 6 pack. Saying \"Diet Coke\" each time. . I even told the story about how this is a Pepsi town and we needed our Diet Coke. . What arrived? Off brand diet cola. . . . . . We picked this place bc of the Diet Coke written on the menu and the implicit guarantee of the guy taking the order. . Side note:  the menu says \"under new management\". . I feel I can say this sucks under new management. . Review of the pizza:  it was 2 pizzas for 21$. It tasted like a 10$ pizza. So I'm ok w it. . . . . Just to prove I'm not crazy I'm going to post a pick of the words Diet Coke. . . . So:  1 star for getting it here in 30 min (guy said 30-45 min, and it was a dinnertime delivery on the Strip) and 1 star bc the food taste met the price.","I liked the ambience much more than the food. I ordered the pizza and it tasted dry, a bit tasteless and not very fresh. . I should've known better, coming to Whitby. . . . .","i went there thinking they had FRESH ingridients, when the lady brought out the crust it looked a bit dry and stale. she thossed it in the trash and tried another, then explained to me that the ingridients are shipped from indianna. . . for 15 bucks i got a pizza that i could have made a better one myself with boboli crust and cheese from albettsons. i wont go there again i make better pizza myself","This place is amazing. The pizza is really good and the service was great also. Will for sure come back whe. We visit again.","I have been here three times and have ordered a variety of dishes, shared family style with friends. My favorites: the lobster ceviche, sea bass, the margarita pizza, the grilled salmon, the ricotta gnocchi. . . . Wow!!!! One dish is better than the next! . The wine selection is impressive, the restaurant is beautiful with a great ambiance, and the service is outstanding! . This is a must for anyone looking for a great meal with lots of variety, yet without overdoing it. . There is a very cool private room in the back that can be reserved for small events and the finger foods served are delicious! . Great for groups of friends, wine tasting, hanging out after an event.","In searching for someplace new to eat in Vegas, Grimaldi's came up and had pretty good reviews. So, based on the featured \"coal-burning\" oven, it was a must-try. . The place is a pretty cool retro-modern looking, table-and-chair, checkered tablecloth, cloth napkin eatery with available(? we weren't asked if we wanted to sit outside) al fresco seating, open kitchen, and full-service? bar. I liked the \"renewable\" wine bottle chande-lights. . For the three of us, we ordered a Large Pepperoni and Italian Sausage pizza, a Personal Mushroom pizza, and the Antipasto, which I HAD TO TRY because of the \"house-made\" Fresh Mozzarella. The Pepperoni and Italian Sausage pizza was pretty good. Good sauce, adequate amount of topping, and a crisp crust, although it did have a somewhat disturbing amount of char on the bottom of it. The mushroom pizza, in my opinion, was a bit scant on one of the most inexpensive of toppings. The Antipasto was quite good, consisting of olives,  oven-roasted red peppers, Genoa salami, fresh mozzarella, and sliced bread. The winner on that plate was the \"house-made\" fresh mozzarella, with the sweet oven-roasted red peppers making a good accompaniment on the sliced bread with the salami and cheese. Oh, and a splash of olive oil and balsamic vinegar (from the leaky bottle)! . The service could use some work, as our waiter was kinda lost. First, messing up a simple one diet coke, one regular coke, one iced tea order, bringing two regular cokes instead and blaming it on the dispenser. Whuh? And nowhere to be found when we were ready to pay our check. He also screwed up our neighboring tables' pizza order, leaving one of three women sitting there watching her friends eat their pizza while hers was re-ordered. And I don't think they put a rush on it. Having back-of-the-house experience, her order should have been re-made \"on-the-fly\", meaning  it should have been made top priority. . Aside from the little snags, I would definitely go back to try the Caprese salad and some other pizza combinations.","I usually get the large cheese pizza and hot fries. This pizza is huge and very tasty!!!! I'm not into hot and spicy things but my fiance is and she loves these fries. I highly suggest giving this place a try if you haven't already.","We did take out. Easy ordering, interesting menu. Ordered the Cauliflower pizza good but a little bland crust was great, hubby had Paul and Young Ron pizza tasty, and house salad, lettuce was crisp dressing was yummy. We'll have to try again. .","Chilling about, waiting for my plane to come. . . I needed a snack, but ended up with a slightly larger than medium pizza. I guess any pizza can be a personal pizza if you try hard enough!. It's a little confusing if you've never been there before. They don't tell you how to order or where to go. They kind of just stand there and wait for you to figure out what to do. They were all in some kind of funk, too. No smiles, no hello-how-ya-doin. Just a whole lotta blank stares. . The guy working the oven eventually asked me what I wanted after he finished with his conversation. I ordered the pizza with bacon and egg (about $7. 50, I think) because it was breakfast time and I felt like I could justify having pizza. Took them a few minutes to reheat it and I was on my way back to my gate. . . which was 20 feet away. Yeah, I was in no hurry. . The flavour was very very unique. I couldn't place where I knew the taste from, but it caught my attention. I've never had a pizza with that bite or tang to it. It was actually pleasant. The egg yolk hardened the second time in the oven, so no ooey-gooey-drippy yolk action, but still plenty of eggy flavour. I should have asked what the green stuff was. Way too savoury to be spinach, but way too thin to be kale. The crust had a nice crunch and it paired surprisingly well with my iced green tea latte and asiago bagel from Starbucks. I was being a carb piggy that morning. It filled me up and made me sleep through my plane ride. Good job, PZA.","Amazing time here tonight . So good with great environment. Really enjoyed the pizza cookie and pizza.","I LOVE THIS PLACE. LOOOOVVVEEEEE IT. . It's so simple, and super great that you can either build your own or choose one that's already built (I. e. The margarita pizza. Drool). . Whenever I want to have a pizza and wine night, I hit up Fried Pie. It is thin crust pizza so it's super delicious without feeling as though you gorged yourself. A lot of these reviews say it's like subway but that's totally not true. Yes, it's build your own, but not even remotely close to a chain like that. . Eat here. Do it. Do it. Do it.","I'm not sure why this place doesn't have at least four stars --- we had the caprese salad and the potato pizza and it was amazing! Usually caprese doesn't stand out but the mozerella was incredible. It is a little on the pricey side for pizza but really good!","I heard from a friend of mine that this place had really good donairs so I decide to give them a try. I myself ordered a pizza and person I was with order a Donair. Both were quite good the Donair was actually really yummy it was a large and it was large definitely not small. I only got a small 10 inch pizza because I've never tried the place before. It was so good the crust was nice and crunchy it is definitely a place I would order a pizza from again only get a larger size. It's a little place not big and fancy guy that was working behind the counter was nice and friendly definitely a place if you're looking to try something new that you haven't tried before a different place give this place a try","Heard a lot about this place, glad I finally know what I need to. Great pizza (good crust, good chew, toppings that stay on the pizza, well seasoned), good apps (antipasto salad), and complimentary garlic Parmesan bread. . Side note: tastes great the next morning too, which is a good test of great pizza.","I've never been a big buffet guy but decided to try this for lunch with some coworkers. I was very disappointed, with both the food and the service. The waitresses were up my ass the entire time, as soon as I drank half of my water, they were ready to refill it. . I wasn't able to even hold a five minute conversation without being rudely interrupted. As for the food, the chicken was a bit dry as well as the pizza. Food seemed like it had been sitting all day. . Only positive I came out with was the decor of the restaurant, authentic Chinese designs and bridge lead you into the dining room. Also live fish also fill the pond in the restaurant. Overall disappointing food, unless you're going here to take snapshots, which I doubt then you should probably stay away.","5 stars for the duck poutine pizza in particular just because I think it's something everyone should try at least once in their life. I loved that the pizza was made out of flatbread so it was thin, light, crispy, and didn't feel super doughy or carby. It comes loaded with toppings like fries, caramelized onions, cheese curds, very soft and juicy duck pieces, green onions, and some kind of herb. Honestly it was super rich and flavourful and delicious and is a really unique dish, which is why I would recommend trying it! Definitely consider sharing between 2-3 people though because it is pretty big - I ate half and then thought I was about to fall into a food coma. Price is also reasonable at $18 I think, especially if you split with a few people! . Also big ups to the service, because the waitress who served us last night was super nice and friendly and added to the good dining experience :). Overall 4-stars for this restaurant because some dishes are just okay. . . but duck poutine pizza is a must!","I absolutely love this place. Allll the pizza here is phenomenal. You can't go wrong with any veggie pizza here. :))) great customer service and very attentive.  . I LOVE THEIR ROLLS. :)","This is my favorite Rosati's location as you can dine in and the pizza is SOOOO much better fresh from the oven!!  I have only ordered the thin crust and probably will never venture elsewhere on the menu because it's so dang good!!  Just like the Rosati's chains back in Chicago except for my absolute favorite location has an all-you-can-eat lunch buffet!!  Then again, maybe it's a good thing they don't have that here. . . .  :). Their prices are not cheap, and they get dinged one star for that.","Can't beat this place for service. Staff is great, especially with kids. Great for out of town visitors. Salads are good, but massive. Boom dip a must. Just had the potato, rosemary and gorgonzola pizza. Very good. Brussel sprouts on menu!","I've seen this place for a long time when coming passing through the parking lot to walmart and finally tried it. It wasn't planned, but panned out nicely. The inside is clean and the service is excellent. On the walls they have signed pictures from various people. I believe the Holly Madison and David Cassidy ones are real because they haven nothing better to do but all the others look like something they ordered from a fan club through the mail. I started out with garlic knots that were very good but I could only handle like 3 of the 6 because there was so much garlic under the bread. If the side of red sauce that came with it had flavor then I think they would have went down better but just by themselves it is a lot to take. My wife liked them but felt the same way about the sauce. I ordered an Italian sandwich for dinner and it was decent. I wanted extra cheese that ended up costing $. 60 more but that was cool by me. My wife enjoyed her soup but thought her pasta dish lacked flavor. Sauce is everything and if the sauce isn't good it limits what you can order at a place like this. I assume that a majority of people come here for pizza and pasta so I don't know maybe it's just me but the sauce needs some vavoom. My wife did sample some pizza and really enjoyed it. I will come back for sandwiches here anytime and want to try their wings. They also have lunch specials and offer a $5 for $10 yelp deal that I will use in my next visit.","Though a chain pizza place, I have never had a bad experience at any of the California Pizza Kitchens that I've been to!. I believe that I've eaten at this location three times over the last several years. I've only ever had pizza here - Pear Gorgonzola, Hawaiian BBQ, and White Cheese. All three of these pizzas were delicious. I'm actually dreaming of the White Pizza right now! . Service has been OK. The wait time has never been quick, but I've also never become irritated by the wait. . . maybe 30 minutes or so. . Even though CPK isn't as exciting as a local, hole-in-the-wall type pizza place, they consistently deliver good food with descent service at a moderate price. And since I like consistency, and am dreaming of their pizza right now, I give them 4 stars!","Been here several times for lunch and had the pizza. Today my friend &amp; I decided to try the sandwiches. Very disappointing! I had the Roast Beef &amp; my friend had the Turkey. Both were lackluster and smothered with slimy roasted red peppers. If you go to Humble Pie, go for the pizza (and the Happy Hour!)","About a month back I prefer delivery from them. It took over an hour and half cause the driver was new . I called and spoke with a manager  Allegedly and was told they would credit my account with a free pizza . I call in a few weeks later and the person I spoke with said there is nothing noted on my account . I explained the situation and was told he couldn't do anything for me cause it was just hear say and he can't go off my word so pretty much called me a liar lol I was like wow great costumer and I would contact their corporate about this to which he replied \" is there anything else I can help u with if not good bye \" and hung up . . . . I can see why papa Johns sales is down . . . amazing","Best pizza in las vegas for sure. I thought it was quite phenomenal for the location and ready it is.","My husband and I got married in Vegas 9/29/12, and though our wedding was not at the Plaza, we decided that we would reserve a block of rooms for our guests here, as well as book a mini suite for ourselves. Let me start by saying the casino, lobby, and rooms were all very nice. I had never stayed at the Plaza prior to this, I don't think I have ever even been inside, but I had heard that they just did the renovation, and heard it was nice, so we went with it. I couldn't decide to give the Plaza 4 stars or 3 stars, based solely on the group reservation department, which is where the hotel missed the 5 star mark for me. Even the rude girl at the check in desk wouldn't have made this hotel lose a star, as I didn't personally experience her, however SEVERAL of my guests did. I felt that the customer service from the group sales department left much to be desired. They didn't get back to me, didn't answer questions - I asked the same question to 2 girls that work there, and after 5 days of no response back from either one, I finally called the manager, and all of a sudden one of the girls called me back within an hour of me leaving the message for the manager, however I still wish the manager would have contacted me back, as I was pretty much done dealing with the girls at that point. I also was pretty surprised to find out that a block of rooms can mean anywhere in the hotel, which sucked that some of our guests were in north tower, some in south tower, and everyone was on different floors from one another. I thought the whole reason we booked it all so far in advance was to have a block of rooms together, at least in the same tower if it couldn't be on the same floor. The lobby of the hotel was really nice, the mcdonalds is open 24 hours, which is nice, the hash house a go go was really really good - we tried to go Saturday morning, but there was over an hour wait, so we ended up going Monday morning, and it wasn't even crowded at all. My parents stayed at the Golden Nugget, and when my dad came over to our room, he was impressed by how big and nice it was. The mini suite had a mini bar, and it was nice to have the fridge in the room. Also, when you book a group reservation, the resort fee is waived, so we were able to access the internet and stuff for no extra charge. I didn't use the parking garage that everyone complains about in other reviews, the south tower is right by the valet, so we used the valet service our entire stay. I also like that they have a security guard stationed at the base of each tower, and you have to show a room key to access the elevators. Overall, I would say our stay was great, we had a great time, and I felt the rooms were pretty nice. Also, there is a lounge called the drink, and we hung out there one night, it was pretty fun, shots for 25 cents every hour on the hour. Only other negative thing was that we brought a babysitter for the wedding night, and when they checked out, they left my kids shoes in the room, when we went to lost and found, they hadn't processed everything that was left over the weekend, and told me to call back the following day. My husbands mom, sister, and aunt also forgot all the clothes hanging in the closet, which included what they wore to our wedding, and lost and found didn't have those items or my kids shoes - so that was kind of disappointing to lose all those items. Oh yeah, we also got a pizza from pop up pizza, and it was really good. My husband wanted to order another one for the road before we left, lol. Also, we went to exposed salon (already reviewed them on yelp) and got our hair and make up done prior to the wedding, and I would recommend those girls to everyone, they did a fantastic job. I decided to go with 4 stars, the plaza really did a great job, and though I would never book a group there again, my husband and I may consider a stay there in the future","2. 5-3 stars. Food meh, service pretty bad. . We arrived with friends of ours who were treating us to dinner. They had a reservation and had to tell 2 different hosts this fact before we were led to the dining room. Ooops! There's no 4-top open in the dining room. So back we go to the front to wait. Then they basically stole two 2-tops from a big group and made a table for us from scratch. But there really wasn't room for it so we were basically sitting out in the middle of a walkway and on top of two other tables. My chair was so uncomfortably close to a lady from another table that she actually got up and moved to the other side of the table. . We were never offered water even after our server finally noticed us and were asked what we'd like to drink but were never brought a drink/beer menu. Overall very clueless, inattentive service. . The food: . Two of us got the fish fry - I'm always in search of a good fish fry and usually never find it. Not here either. It was haddock which was breaded and fried but the fish was very overcooked - it shouldn't have the texture of meat. Green beans were undercooked - I like 'em a little crunchy as much as the next guy but these were borderline raw. Fries were decent but nothing amazing. . One of the guys got the Porky Pie pizza which he said was pretty good and the other got the special which was 'smoked beer can chicken mac and cheese'. It did sound good and it came out looking pretty awesome. We all tried it and it was tasty, but for me it would be WAY too rich for a main dish and I probably could only have eaten a quarter of the plate. . Overall, this place was not so great which sucks because we've been to the Beach Club Bistro several times and had very good experiences there. Three stars is generous for this trip given the really crappy service and underwhelming food.","I came here for the first time earlier this week and thought it was a good spot for a date or dinner out with friends. The staff was friendly, the food was ok, and the wine selection was good. I'm sure I'll be back again. . Wine: Albari\u00f1o (yum). Apps: The beet dish and the tuna dish were both quite good, though nothing especially memorable. I appreciated that the tuna dish was not too salty, which is rare to find in this city. . Pizza Margherita: I was disappointed with the quality of the pizza considering that they have a proper pizza oven. The dough itself was thicker than it should be and lacked the airy quality of true italian style pizza. The sauce was descent and the mozzarella they used was very good. The one thing I couldn't understand the were the slices of beefsteak tomatoes on top of the pizza. . . very odd.","Amazing pizza! The atmosphere is casual yet a bit fancy. This is the first time we have had Luigi's but it is now my favorite pizzeria. The pizza was mouth-watering and didn't hurt my wallet.","The only reason why four stars and not five because we didn't try the pizza yet. . The items we did try were; garlic bread knots, minestrone soup, cheese ravioli in alfredo sauce, spaghetti and meatballs, and cheese cake. . All was fabulous and the service was very good too!","We're in from Nashville and the meeting went late. Went to Anthony's. . . well because it was open. What a pleasant surprise. . . the pizza was fantastic! The coal fired ribs with peppers were out of this world. . . definitely an original recipe and worth going there just for them. . The waitress and and manager were awesome and even sent us home with some free wings to try. I couldn't wait until tomorrow so I had one. . . another winner. . Great place, great staff, 5 stars all the way.","I had a terrible waiter tonight at CPK, I waited what seemed like forever for him to appear. I requested bottled water and after 10 minutes he told me they didn't have any. I ordered a glass of wine and an unsweetened ice tea. He didn't bring my ice tea. When he brought my pizza I mentioned my iced tea, he apologized and bought it. He didn't return to ask if I needed anything. I flagged him down and asked for a box which he retrieved and basically threw on the table. I flagged him again for my check left the $ amount and a tip and left. I will definitely contact corporate to express my dissatisfaction with him. The food was good he was horrible.","This is my kind of pizza. The crust is so thin and always cooked perfectly in their coal oven. Don't leave without trying the fries.","This place is really adorable. We had originally gone to the sister restaurant for \"pizza\", which they didn't have. We're so glad, because, for the price, you really can't beat this place. The pizza is PERFECT, not too thin (I'm sorry my idea of pizza is not phyllo dough with some mozzarella splattered here and there) and not too thick (a moment on the lips, a lifetime on these freakin hips!). My husband is Italian &amp; has grown up with an Italian mom making homemade pizza his whole life, he was very impressed. Quality mozzarella, homemade tomato sauce with the right amount of herbs. The Caesar salad was well done, the right amount of dressing, I could taste anchovies but not overwhelmingly so, and the lettuce was crisp &amp; fresh. My only suggestion - add some garlicky croutons. This is the best part, though. If you have kids, there is a\"VIP\" room for them, complete with cartoons and video games, amazing! We sat &amp; enjoyed our chianti while the little rugrats were engrossed in a show. You can't beat that precious bit of paradise.","The concept is awesome . Its $60 an hour. So it will be pricey if you think this is a date night kind of place. I guess limited space they need a deeper surcharge. . I went on week night and they don't have any half an hour rate or weekday special to play the foot pool. So we decided to sit at the bar and eat. . Drink menu was reasonable but we were hungry. Thought we would start with an appetizer- and that's where we stopped. Our Margarita pizza looked atrocious and tasted even worse. Raw basil on cheap cheese on a wet pizza dough that didn't look like it was cooked. . I didn't mean to be rude- but when the waitress asked me how the food was, I honestly responded \"Trash\". I am sorry but I get cranky when I am hungry and having to eat that made it worse. Luckily there are other food places around and that solved it because that app gave me a good impression of the rest of the menu. . I apologize for being rude as the servers and all the staff were genuinely helpful and very friendly. . I might be back with a larger group and have drinks and rent the foot pool area. . Food is bad- eat before you come!!","Tried the sourdough pizza! Yum!!  Today was the first day they served Red Velvet cake!! Delicious!!! Glad to see they are adding items to their dessert menu. Typically great, friendly service from their staff! Go upstairs and check out their game room too. Great fun and flashbacks.","I was seriously so impressed with this place. We ordered our food and grabbed a table at the brewery (which was also super awesome). Our food came out quickly and the servers are very accommodating and kind. The pizza we had was delicious and so was our appetizer. We would definitely return! Looking forward to seeing what Barnone offers in general in the future!","The happy hour specials are what it's all about. Half priced drafts of very great beers and the $5 personal pizzas are grand. After happy hour there are usually some other great specials that start at 7:00. . My only qualm is the normal draft prices and the prices on toppings for pizzas (spinach in particular). In my opinion, soggy canned spinach should not be a \"premium fresh\" topping that costs close to $5 to be tossed onto a pie. . In summary, check the online draft list and if you see something intriguing, head there for happy hour.","Ordered for delivery and was told to expect a 40 minute wait, after an hour and a half our cold pizza's arrived. . The meat lovers pizza contained tasteless greasy Italian sausage, soggy pepperoni, and cold crusty ham slices in extremely sparing amounts. . The grilled steak chipotle pizza came completely without sauce. Nothing better than a cold dry pizza. . Would not recommend to my worst enemies.","Worst customer service ever ! Driver first got our order wrong three times and had to keep returning to switch out our pizza then our mozzarella sticks then we got the wrong 2 liter. Driver then offers a meal on her for all the inconvenience and doesn't fall thru with her offering. Every time we order from them our order is always wrong. I'd rather go to dominos !","I had free delivery from Postmates and decided to try. I ordered the veggie ranch pizza thin crust no broccoli sub artichoke and was so good! (If you love veggies) I asked for ranch on side that I didn't receive but I don't even care because the pizza was so flavorful without!","I don't know what the hype is about - I tried the Fetalicious pizza, and while it was *good* and I *enjoy feta cheese very much* I did not have dreams of  nor cravings for this pizza. Perhaps if I'd had it with thin crust instead. . .","I've give it 4. 5 stars if I could. More veggie options like spinach would put it over the top. Had a large pizza with pepperoni sausage tomatoes and red peppers, and a white pizza with sausage meatballs basil garlic and artichoke. Both were great but the white pizza won. Next time I may try their pesto pizza.","The name of this pizzeria caught my eye so we stopped in to get some slices to go. Service was excellent and the pizza was good. The slices are HUGE!! The full menu looks enticing and would return if I'm ever in the area again.","Avoid this place! I ordered a personal pesto pizza with very little chicken, tomatoes, spinach, onions, and olives and my total was $20! Ridiculous. No one that was making the pizza mentioned that each topping was extra. I started off with a $7. 99 pizza! How in the world did those little toppings add $12. 00! Workers are all incompetent. I was shocked when I received my total. I told the cashier that ALL the other make your own pizza places don't charge extra for toppings. The cashier's response was uhhhhh I just moved here from out of state. He looked like a deer in the headlights. I told him I'm never coming back. No offer to keep a first timer happy or even get a manager after it was obvious that this was a deal breaker for me. . To be fair the pizza was good and the decor is very well done inside. Go to MOD or Pieology instead.","Looking for the perfect thin crust pizza? Well if you like homemade mozzarella then try out Upper Crust Pizza and Wine Bar. Our friends introduced us to this restaurant on a recent visit to Scottsdale. This restaurant is situated in a strip mall and doesn't look like anything special from the outside but take a step inside and you'll feel differently. It has that \"cozy\" feeling that makes you want to keep coming back. . They make a variety of homemade pizzas to order that come out of the oven with just the right amount of \"crispness\". On my short trip to Scottsdale I made 2 visits to Upper Crust. (We just liked it so much the first time I couldn't wait to go back). In addition to pizza they feature calzone and pasta on the menu. It's a casual place that's big on \"atmosphere\". On both visits we were lucky enough to have \"Laura\" wait on us. She was personable and made our experience very enjoyable. . Pizza sizes tend to be larger than what you would expect. The \"personal size\" pizza was plenty to eat for my party of 2. If you're a wine lover my tip would be to make a visit on a Wednesday night. All bottles of wine are half off!","One of the very worst Pizza Hut's I have ever dealt with. They messed up my order, promised me a $15 credit in return, and then Rob and Tatiana refused to honor the credit. Their customer service skills were laughable. Rather than giving me a free cheese pizza, Rob spent 15 minutes on the phone interrogating me. And Tatiana seems to have never had a customer service job prior to this in her entire life. I ended up going to Domino's Pizza, where I got much better service for the same price.","I was really excited to try Destihl, but unfortunately the experience fell a little flat. My friend and I arrived a little after 7 on a Friday night and was told the wait would be about 40 minutes since we didn't have reservations. No problem. After only about 20-25 minutes our pager buzzed, so score! So far so good. Our server was really nice and attentive, nothing negative to say about him. However, the food is another story. . We started with the cheese curds for an appetizer. And these were awesome, plus they give you a lot. The only part of the meal that really stood out, sadly. I'd had my eye on the strawberry goat cheese salad, so I got that and split the pesto goat cheese pizza. The salad had a lot of potential with all the seemingly good ingredients, but was just off. The spinach tasted wrong and it would have been much better with mixed greens. The \"strawberry\" part of the salad consisted of maybe three tiny pieces and the goat cheese wasn't even very good. It mainly was made up of mandarin oranges and ill-tasting spinach. . I'm not a huge fan of wood-fired pizza (I prefer almost any other type of crust). My friend and I split a pizza, but I saw plenty of people putting one away all by themselves. It is very thin. The toppings were ok, but I didn't like how the goat cheese was in big globs instead of spread over the whole pizza. . We left without getting dessert, but I saw a few and they are possibly the biggest desserts I've ever seen anywhere. This isn't a good thing. Probably 3-4 people should be splitting on dessert, but I'm guessing that doesn't happen that often. So just be aware if you do order that piece of cake. . Besides the service, the other positive is the price. Everything is fairly cheap. But that coincides with the quality, so just beware.","Super good pizza. . . . Server. . . not so much. Put our food down and disappeared. She never checked on us until it was tip time. Sorry but life doesn't work that way.","I've forgiven their rudeness over the phone many times, basically because I am able to order online. Tonight my son forgot to order one of our pizzas online and they gave him SO much grief about adding to the order that I finally took the phone. Asked the guy if we could add to the order, or at least have 2 online orders delivered at the same time. I get on the phone and this jack wagon says \"It's not MAGIC, ma'am!\" Ummm not asking for magic. He hung up on me. Solid business skills. Cancelled my order and got Dominos. Learn some people skills, you idiots","This is my second visit to Urban Tea Loft and I know many people absolutely LOVE this place. I'm just so-so. Our party of 12 truly enjoyed the delicious bruschetta, the cool crisp salads with yummy bacon, and the ultra-delicious, oh-so-incredible desserts. I'm talking chocolate peanut butter mousse cake, carrot cake, chocolate banana cake, red-velvet cake and on and on. Skip the veggie pizza and the pastas. Oh, and don't get your hopes up until you ask if they are out of the catfish! Overall, the service was pretty bad. Our server was confused and forgot our orders; some of us got extra tea that we didn't order and some of us never got refills; they were out of 4 or 5 major items on the menu (it was a Thursday evening) and at the end of dinner we had to go through our orders again because of a misplaced tab. Three of our small plates were seriously dirty with leftover food on them. Ick. We all agreed this place was okay, but could use some more help.","If you fee like overpaying for average pizza while 80s music is playing in the background and you have to yell to hear each other this is your place. Paid $90 for 4 drinks and 2 pizzas. The service was great and decor was nice but I would rather spend $30 at MyPie pizza.","Not only is the pizza awesome but so are the wings! The salads and cheese bread and everything else we've had here we have always enjoyed! We continue to go back because the food is always great and the service is always awesome. We recommend this place!","This is best restaurant I've been to in AZ! We are from California and come a few times a year, every time we are here we have to eat at Oreganos! Employees here are so friendly and the food is delicious!! Great atmosphere too! I recommend the Pablo Picasso salad and the deep dish pizza  but everything I've tried has not disappointed!","Came here on Saturday night there was a line of people waiting to be seated but we had reservations so we're promptly seated. Started with the carpaccio and the burrata board, both were very good and great portions. I ordered the pesto chicken pizza with jalape\u00f1os and the hubby had veal piccata with the fried gnocchi. The pizza was great but I have to admit my husbands dish was amazing. I'm pretty sure it was the fried gnocchi that just took it over the top!!! Dessert however was a huge disappointment we had the zeppole which was fried phyllo dough that was extremely greasy and somewhat undercooked. I'm definitely going back but staying away from the dessert! . . . Wow what a difference when you do take out! We ordered the bruschetta which was fine but the burrata board was anything but. . . . it was literally less than half the size of the one we ordered when we sat down for dinner. If I'm paying the same price as if we were to sit down why am I only getting a portion of the food?! Consistency is the key when it comes to restaurants survival, why would we want to return if we don't even know what we will be getting","I ordered nearly $50 worth of food. It was for my son's birthday. It took over an hour for delivery to arrive and then they did not even deliver it to my door. I had to go down 3 stories and pick it up from the parking lot and still tipped the driver $7. 00. EVERY SINGLE ITEM WAS INEDIBLE.  Some was undercooked. Some was burned. All of it was awful. I immediately called to complain (not my usual) and found oitbtjat it was routed through a call center in Alaska. I finally reached the location after being hung up on several times. I was told they could not refund my card, so I informed them I had paid in cash. I was told I would receive my money back. An hour later I called the call center again and was put on hold at which time I was told they could not exchange the food as there was no more foid at the reataurant????? I was told an hoir later that the driver was bringing my money back to me. Food is completely uneaten and waiting to be picked up when the owner calls me and informs me he refuses to refund me and offers me a free pizza. DO NOT ORDER FRON THIS PLACE! IT IS DISGUSTING AND SOMEONE WILL END UP SICK AS A RESULT. I'll never see my money, but maybe I can save you some.","Super endroit pour des pizzas qui sortent de l'ordinaire! Mes coups de coeur jusqu'\u00e0 maintenant: la BPM et la gourmande (de loin ma pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e!). La Carbonara est bonne, mais manque un peu de fra\u00eecheur (tr\u00e8s sal\u00e9e, mais on s'en attend!). La weed eater est aussi tr\u00e8s bonne. L'ambiance est vraiment relax, la musique pas trop forte. C'est un endroit parfait pour un souper entre amis ou en couple un lundi soir :) . Cette succursale ne sert plus d'alcool pour le moment, mais je n'ai pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir pourquoi. . Le resto a des promotions int\u00e9ressantes, notamment ce soir il y avait 5 choix de pizza \u00e0 7$ \u00e0 l'achat d'un breuvage. . Il en co\u00fbte environ 14$ pour les pizzas, mais aux alentours de 16-18$ pour les pizzas \"sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9\". Une pizza par personne est amplement suffisante!","Came in for Sunday Brunch. Was impressed, they were able to turn the restaurant into a buffet style brunch which offers both Italian and Western style brunch options. . There was an egg station where you can have made to order eggs made with a lot of good premium toppings. Also, there was a pizza and pasta station. Both also made to order with good toppings to choose. There is a pizza oven right there, so it was quick and cool to see and also, tasted great. . There was also a rack of lamb carving station. This was probably the highlight of the food. Roasted to a perfect medium, with a delicious mustard and some banana peppers. . There were also some cheeses and deli meats, as well as a waffle station and fruits and dessert. The dessert was clearly store bought, but it's okay, it's not what they are known for so you can't really judge on that. . Another thing to note, all bubblies are 50% during brunch - whether it be by the glass, or bottle. Awesome!. I would come back for their brunch.","Visited here on 10-22-16, a busy Saturday night at Westgate. We were seated almost immediately. Server was fine. My disappointment was with the margherita pizza, usually one of our favorites. I've never had a margherita pizza like this. Instead of thin, succulent slices of red tomatoes, halves of cherry tomatoes were dropped on the pie!  And not too many of those, either. Instead of chiffonaded basil, or chopped basil, sprinkled across the pie, one large leaf was placed in the middle of each slice. I had to tear each leaf into pieces by hand in order to properly distribute them across each piece so I could get that wonderful basil flavor in each bite. The sauce was bland, more sweet like Oreganos rather than a real Italian taste. The crust was okay. Upon a return to Westgate Entertainment Center we'll be looking for another place to spend our food dollars.","Marathon Diner may not look fancy, but I had the best airport meal of my life here!  Skip the long line at McDonald's and head to Marathon for authentic, fresh, made-to-order Greek diner food. . The veggie gyro ($10) was filled with peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes, lettuce, and feta cheese. So good, and I almost feel like it was healthy?!  The guy working at the griddle (possibly the owner?) was really nice about asking whether I wanted banana peppers, cheese, etc. , so I'm sure they would accommodate special requests. I love that Marathon offers a tasty and satisfying vegetarian option, because the cheese pizza slices at Villa just looked sad! . Obviously I was just here for dinner, but Marathon Diner serves breakfast too!  Definitely stop here if you are hungry in the Pittsburgh airport. You can really tell that they put a lot of love into the food!","My wife and I stopped here for dinner and were seated outside on the patio (fine so far). The waiter (owner?)took forever to come out but it was busy. He acted bored while we ordered our appetizers and actually was staring directly over my head while I ordered. Whatever, we wrote it off as weird. The cheese plate was dismal. There is no way they make that cheese fresh, and I could have gotten better cheese at the trader joes around the corner for a third of what theirs cost. Eventually our snobby waiter made it back to our table. He told us the specials and again wouldnt look at either of us. . . when we ordered a margherita pizza to share he literally huffed and said \"is that all?\" and walked off. We were flabbergasted. He did not return their the entire duration of our stay, not to bring us more drinks, not to get our dessert order, not even to ask how the food was (not great-a margherita pizza should have a certain type of mozzarella and some fresh basil on it. This looked like a generic by the slice type pizza you would find at any chain joint). Seriously we are both pretty easy going and not terribly demanding of a server. But to be flat out ignored and treated like they didn't want us there was outrageous. I don't know what that guys problem is, but if the management cares about their business at all they need to address those problems. As it is, we won't ever go back, and I would tell anyone who asked me about what a terrible experience we had and how mad we were upon leaving after waiting 2 hours for the check. I had to get up and ask the guy at the door for the check. He was the only nice person there.","For three days in a row I was literally fed in this restaurant as part of all day training sessions. It is a pity the resto is located in a hotel and in general it will be ignored by the population of Montreal. Food was really nice. Fresh salads, deliciously looking french fries that made me jealous as I didn't pick a dish including them, huge portion of very well prepared pasta with sausage and shrimp. The pizza I had the last day was relatively good for a non pizza place, but huge. We left so much food behind that I still feel guilty. Service was friendly and very well organized. The room is designed in french bistro style and it is bright, and inviting. It is not cheap if you are there on your own, still a nice option for a good meal in the area.","Excellent pizza and reasonable for LV.  Veggie with artichoke hearts - yum!  A Fremont winner.","My second time, and might be my last. First time they were only open a couple weeks. I was the only person in the place and wasn't greeted when I came in. I ordered a slice to dine in. The employee couldn't have looked less interested in waiting on me. I almost didn't ask about the baked goods but I wanted a cookie. She didn't know anything that was in the cases. I sat down and when she brought my pizza she basically threw it on the table without a word. The pizza was slightly above average as was the tiramisu cookie. . . So I tried again today. Very friendly server, but a bit overwhelmed. I needed 4 cookies and a slice to go.  20 minutes later, its ready, but 2 of the cookies are wrong. Okay, maybe I miscommunicated so I wanted to buy the other 2 cookies for my friends and the server who is overwhelmed (1 table was leaving with 2 ladies and a single person came in for a slice) told me that the owner would take care of me. I stood at the bakery case for another 5 minutes. The owner was discussing advertising with 2 gentlemen, so I don't know if he knew I was waiting, but 25 minutes is a little excessive for a quick to go order, so I left. There are a lot of pizza places that are comparable or better and I can sacrifice having a cookie. Customer service is important to me and the main reason I am a repeat customer. Talked to people in the nail salon in the same complex and they said my experience is similar to others they have heard. Can't say I'd recommend this place to friends and family based on my two visits.","Tried this place before reading reviews or else I never would have. . . . Really like their chx Alfredo pizza. . . . Wouldn't recommend much else here tho. . .  keep going back for chx Alfredo pizza, even saw a guy that goes there just for that pizza too. . . .  4 stars, based solely on that pizza alone","I really really didn't want to like this place (kind of tongue in cheek)- I love me my Mangiafoco, and want to be able to say that nothing holds a candle to it. . . . . but alas. . . I liked it. I really really liked it. Ok- the noise level is through the roof, which makes dining and actually having a conversation very hard. . . . but the dining part is easy. Burrata, salumi plate, polpette - 3 delicious appetizers. When I asked for some balsamic for the burrata, I didn't get attitude. . . I got. . . balsamic!  Mains - pasta pomodoro, the lasagna and a simple pizza were all equally delicious. Take my word for it. . . it is easy to make a pomodoro sauce. . . it is really hard to make a great pomodoro sauce. This one was delicious. . Damn you Bevo. . . I didn't want to like you.  :)","Being a historic willow resident, I am a little based but. . . . This place is the end all be all. They have what you crave at all times. Once, I spent a whole day in here. Coffee and a breakfast sandwich at 10 am, had a lunch meeting and had the salmon wrap, then ate dinner here. . All the pizzas are on point!. If you are in Phoenix midtown do not skip over this Treasure.","Ah Marcs, what can I say. . . . . . the disorganization, the old ladies giving me the evil eye when I try to go around them as they ponder the many jars of pickled relishes with there cart at a 45 degree angle to the shelves. . . . . . The newly opened Marcs at Kamms Plaza was a bit of a shock -when I first saw it. . . . . it was the nicest Marcs I had ever seen. They have GD chandeliers in this joint. . . anyway went over to get two things -  corned-beef and cabbage - walked out with Crystal Light, apples, stuff to make Chilli, a BPA free water bottle, and two window planters. . . . . This Marcs is hands down the best Marcs around that I have seen. Very clean, and they have a deli. They also have continued to carry Corbo's bakery items (i. e. cakes, pizza dough). I have been checking prices with ShopSavvy app and have found that most prices are equal or less than most. . Yep nice Marcs. . .","Seriously the best pizza I've ever had! I'm gonna be so sad when I go back to California and can't have it:(","I had a coupon for a 14\" pie from United Blood Services and I stopped in to use it yesterday. I sat at the counter. The woman running the counter area gave me some menus and she got an iced tea for me. . I ordered a 14\" pizza with cheese and pepperoni. While waiting, the server brought me three garlic knots. They were hot and fresh but they could have used more garlic. The knots were accompanied by a small container of hot marinara for dipping. . In a normal amount of time, another server brought me the pizza and kidded me when she realized I was dining solo. Later she came back and asked me if I wanted her to box the rest to bring home. . The pizza was good. I prefer thick crust pizza but this was a credible thin crust pizza with a small amount of tomato sauce and more cheese and pepperoni. . I was impressed by the staff. They were very friendly and they realized from the get go that I was a first time customer. I'd recommend them and I'll probably be back if I'm in the mood for thin pizza. I also had a chance to peruse the menu and saw the Italian dinners they serve. Maybe that would be something to try.","The staff is so incredibly nice! The restaurant was clean and up to date. The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because the pizza sauce was a little on the sweet side (something I am not used to) but it was interesting to try! Other than that it was a great experience, the Antonio's Special Salad was great!","Heist is amazing! I came here with a group of friends and we all ordered different things, because it was nearly impossible to pick one thing. When the food came out everything looked so unique and creative. I couldn't pick a favorite, but the lobster bisque is awesome, and you can pick any of the flatbread pizzas and you will be very pleased. Aside from beer, they had homemade soda's. We got black cherry and cream, which were really, really good. Overall we had a great night and I can't wait to come back for lunch :)","A large pizza with Sausage (more like pepperoni), mushroom and green peppers for 30$???? Are you kidding me?","Had carry out pizza recently. We were really happy with the pizza. Crust, sauce, toppings, all great. We ended up with one pizza with some toppings we didn't order, not things we didn't want, just didn't order. I should have checked them in the store. Had it not been for that minor item it would have been 5 stars. Will get pizza from them again for sure.","Sooo the name may not seem too appealing. Is their signature drink called a \"Tetanus Shot\"? No, not quite - I actually don't know if they have one or not. But they do make their own Sour Mix, Bloody Mary Mix and simple syrup. Maybe the Pine Fin???. Once inside though, any preconceived notions of this Tavern/Sports Bar will be gone. The d\u00e9cor is really nice - lots of dark burly, manly wood and a copper footrest at the bar. A couple of enormous flat screen TVs. Tons of seating indoors and out. . We came here for a little day drinking (it's a real hobby - look it up). There's plenty on tap and in bottle, including seasonal brews from Birdsong and Triple C. . My friends ordered a bottle of Piper Sonoma knowing that it wasn't cold yet. The bartender worked her magic, with a huge tub of ice, some salt and about 10-15 minutes. . So a short visit - didn't get to try their food yet (blame it on Cripsy Bahn Mi-hehe) - even though appetizers and pizzas are are half price weekday afternoons (3-6 PM). There's always next time. . Good place to get a drink by Southpark!","Honestly going with a large group of friends, we ordered and ate a lot of different pizzas. I am not going to say every Pizza was my favorite because who would believe me. . I can say however, Anthonys pizza is above the rest! Their meatball pizza is my favorite and their wings are truly the most amazing wings. I love wings, however theirs are like a dry rubbed type wings, with this amazing taste. . Anthonys is in our top 3 pizza places to eat.","Nasty! I was so excited to check it out after reading all the great reviews. Just went to NYC in Oct so wanted to compare. Sorry not NY style pizza.","Moved to the area recently and was looking for good, local pizza. Tried this place out. Family owned, which I like, but the service seemed to lack enthusiasm. The single large pizza I ordered was prepared in a reasonable amount of time and I took it home. It was plenty hot when I returned home, and that's great. The problem is. . it wasn't very good. The sauce was dull, the crust struck me as generic, and the quality of toppings didn't blow my mind. I'd put it on par with Papa John's, and  that's not necessarily a compliment.","First visit to this location and am extremely disappointed. Sad to know who served me is now getting 10/hr. I know someone could provide a way better customer experience than this person did for the same amount of money. If I was a business owner I'd be firing a crew like this as I'd lose out on business.  . First of all I arrived to find a hand drawn note on the door stating sorry we will open at 11, when they should have opened at 10:30a. . Second they opened after 11 and the guy had no customer service once he unlocked the door. Once i  entered nothing was said to me I simply stood near the register waiting to be acknowledged. The guy decided to continue working behind the registers while his coworker stood around and snacked on something before I eventually was acknowledged.  . Thirdly, once I was acknowledged the guy asked what he could get for me. I said I would like 3 hot and readys please. He said my total  and then walked away before I could pay . I continued to wait while he left me at the registers and went in the back area.  . Fourthly,  I waited over 10 minutes watching him stack up multiple pizza boxes with pizzas,   put stickers on pizza boxes,  placed finished pizzas in the warmers,  watched his Co worker  had off a pizza to someone who just drove up to the drive through all while I still stood there waiting.  . Fifthly, a third co worker eventually arrived and I asked her why that person received their order before me?. She went to the back and words were said between her and the coworkers and she just disappears.  . Finally the guy brings me my order stands at the register and just stares at me. . . I ask him  Oh are you ready for me to pay now?? He says yes and the total.  . If I didn't have  a hard working team I wanted to appreciate I would have just left. I chose to go through this experience to the end and now here I am. . I hope the owners read this and take discipline on those employees. If you don't believe me. Check your cameras.","Back in the day, I really liked ABC. I still really like their food. It's just too chaotic for me usually. I used to live on the East Side. . . and never really understood how reluctant East Siders are to cross the river. Several years ago, W25th was a stretch. I moved downtown - just west of the river (literally - the river is my front \"yard\") and I have begun to understand why people use highways and venture all over the Greater CLE area when they live on the West Side. Ok. . . you might be asking where I am going with this. . . . Even though I loved ABC. . . XYZ seemed like a long haul (again, I realize the errors in my ways) several years ago when it opened. Even though. . . its what? A half-mile further? Ok, ok. . . . I finally ventured to XYZ for the first time this summer. . . expecting to experience the same ABC environment. Wrong. The food is equally foody and amazing. . . . but the environment is so much more sophisticated, and so much less. . . dive bar. . The patio in the summer is incredible. And, this place has carry out pizza. burgers are good. The salmon BLT is delish. Even the fries are tasty. . You're certain to run into interesting individuals here whom you can easily strike up conversations with at the bar or at another table. Friendly vibe, no crazy packed space. I like the end of the alphabet a little better these days. . .","Gotta love this place. . they make the pizzas as expected all the time! Also the customer service js good :)","Really amazing pizza, and a great team of people. I ordered online, and somehow Sal's received a different order than the one I placed (they showed me what had come up on their order screen). I didn't have my phone with me to show them what I had actually ordered, but they were incredibly nice about it, and made a whole new pizza to correct the order. To top it off, the pizza was incredible! Will definitely be going back!","Good pizza and garlic bread. Server was quick and friendly! Moderately priced. Nice selection of beer.","Average name brand pizza but with the flavored crust. I usually go up the street to Johnny B's unless they aren't open yet and the kids are driving me nuts for pizza and we are next door playing computer games at SL computers. Low quality cheese and crust like most other chains. They usually make a 4-5 out of 10 but hey it's cheap so there's no room for better quality.","This pizzeria place is terrible. The service was rude and they refused to let us eat our food at the table due to \"health code rules\". We were told that we could eat outside! We were able to order drinks but were told rudely several times that we could not have our pizza until we left the premises. Very unacceptable IMHO","I guess if you are truly desperate than this will serve a purpose. Just don't keep your expectations high. . We had guests in town and they were gambling it up in the D and didn't want to leave. We just wanted to sneak away and slam dunk something quick so we weren't hungry. So, in that sense, it served its purpose. . We got the 5. 99 \"special\" of 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. The pizza was obviously microwaved and very much like \"Michaelina\" type \"pizza\" you would buy in a grocery store. I mean. . I held it down, but it was nothing special. The drink was pretty pitiful too. . . probably around the 12- 16 oz variety. . Plus, how can you serve food and NOT have a public restroom? Isn't that a violation of some sort??? Seriously?. If you insist on eating here, just know what you're getting into. . . . 2 stars.","I had supper this evening at Vivoli. I've walked by it lots of times but have never stopped in. It was such a nice day and I sat on the patio. . Katerina, my server, brought me some bread along with olive oil and balsamic vinegar to start. . Pizza are made in a wood burning oven and take about a minute. I ordered a Bambini pizza. It was a good pizza!  The dough was soft and puffy and chewy . . . just how I like it. The sauce was tasty and there was lots of pepperoni. I'd get it again. . Katerina was friendly. . I'll be back!","Grab a pizza here, grab a beer next door, and enjoy the weather on either place's patio. I love the simplicity of the items here. Both the Margherita and the Fire and Brimstone are delicious, but beware that the latter has some kick to it! The weekly special was also scrumptious, though unusual. I've never thought to put pistachio on a pizza, but it definitely works. I've heard the weekly special tends to push the boundaries on pizza toppings; I think it's great that the chefs have a creative outlet while keeping the regular menu tried and true. Definitely get some dessert before you leave. The chocolate chip and butterscotch pizookies are winners. I'll be back to try the s'mores nachos :)","I love this place ! the pizza is amazing with a fantastic crispy crust. The fire oven definitely helps in this. I highly recommend the fresh basil. I noticed something unique about this NY ambience. The lights dim every few minutes to mimic a NY Subway passing by. I am a pizza snob and this place rocks !","Try the fresh red sauce, calamari fritti, spaghetti carbonara, gnocchi with red sauce, pizza di Parma, cannoli, tiramisu. This place is great. It feels like a home kitchen and you say hello to the chef. There is a plethora of good things to say about the food and drinks here. Dora, the Italian manager, was pleasant and made us feel like familia. Simply perfetto!","Went in for the Grand Opening party. All was great but was a little disappointed they've raised the price on the pizza compared to the paradise location. Will be back though to try the wings to see if they are as good as paradise location.","I was here recently for happy hour. The pizza and wings were quite good. I like their selection of beers on tap. Plenty of TVs so I'm sure I'll be back again sometime to catch a game.","VERDICT: Come for the delicious bread, leave for the atmosphere. . I really like Great Harvest Bread Co.  They do regular sliced bread a service, by making it fresh, preservative free and delicious. The difference between Great Harvest Bread and Panera is dramatic. Great Harvest shies away from croissants and danishes. Instead they focus on white, wheat, and various other basic sliced breads. They are really good though. It really makes you detest going back to the normal grocery store fodder. The downfall, as is with quality, is the price, about $5-$6 per loaf. They also have cookies and a few bready desserts. . Part deux of this review really has to focus on the experience and atmosphere. First, I was really excited to find a Great Harvest over by my Costco on Decatur. I forced Greg to pull over and rush in. However, there was a group of six or so teenage n'er-do-wells also approaching the store at the same time. I was determined to get to the store before them and told Greg to hurry or they were going to beat us to the door. He said, \"don't worry, they'll eat up the free samples and you'll get a fresh loaf to sample\". He just said that because he is a lollygagger and hates to \"pick up the pace\". I must be getting old since I've already used the terms \"n'er-do-well\" and \"lollygagger\" in this post. Anyway, I let the hooligans beat me to the store. . Inside the narrow store, the teenagers turned out to be less of a threat. It appeared to be closeted gay boys with their Christian-youth-group-approved girlfriends out having a wild time by venturing to the bread store to get a couple of sandwiches and get an inappropriate amount of free samples. You know, basically being complete rebels. They were kind of too outwardly excited about their bread samples in a wholesome way, saying things like \"I love bread\" and \"bread rocks\". It was like those Totino pizza roll ads where the kids wax feverishly about their love of frozen food. . This process actually took a long time, giving me an ample amount of time to give Greg the I-told-you-so eye for being a lollygagger. Something I'm sure he was oblivious to noticing. During this time, I was also able to look around at all of the customers sitting at tables. There were quite a few of them. I would say at least ten people scattered through the sitting area. Then it struck me as being incredibly odd. Every single person was facing the counter. Every single person was not eating, drinking, or talking. They were just staring at the counter. I felt this existential feeling like I was starring in Sartre's \"No Exit\". They were the audience and I didn't know that I was in the play. It was bizarre. I know, I know, I often accuse restaurants of being cults, as in crEATe and the nearby Salad Creations, but I think I'm on to something. It was odd. I have no idea what is going on there. . In any case, I get the counter with my Dakota wheat bread (sooooo gooood). I get my choice of free samples and the girl behind the counter offered me the heel of the bread. Those n'er-do-well, hooligan, gays and their beards stole my chance for a decent sample. And Greg's lollygagging didn't help either.","My boyfriend and I love this place. We have never had anything bad on the menu. Everyone is always friendly, that staff is always pleasant and attentive to us, we never have to ask for anything and always are satisfied completely when we leave. The eggplant pizza is a must have, along with the peppers and ribs. Recently tried the philly cheese steak pizza, which was pretty good, again no disappointments. Recently went to Bella Luna and Anthony's just blows all pizza places out of the water in the Monroeville area as far as Coal Fired or Wood Fired oven pizza goes. Anthony's really meets up to the upscale pizza parlor for an excellent dining experience. Definitely a must try, you will not be disappointed. Just caution PIZZA IS OVERDONE, which is a plus and also achieves that perfect coal fired oven taste.","Tried Pizza Fire for the first time tonight and loved it! Purchased two pizzas to go and chose a variety of toppings. All very yummy! My niece tried the margherita and devoured it. Our family will definitely return again and again! It's great to have local pizza that doesn't taste greasy or overly processed like most chains do. Crust has a great texture and the flavors are exactly what you'd want from a fresh pizza. Worth the visit!","Went here for Summerlicious 2013. In a word, this place was horrible but let me give you a few details. Service is terrible. My meal started with my waiter bringing me a warm beer. The time it took for the food to arrive was also incredibly long. . For starter, I got the catfish. It tasted like it was frozen before and they just popped it into the deep fryer before serving it to me. . For the main course, I got the Chicken and Waffles, which for some unknown reason is ranked #2 on BlogTo. This was the worst fried chicken I've had in my life. Popeye's and KFC are both MUCH tastier than this. Chicken was dry and had no flavor or seasoning at all. And for the Waffles they used AUNT JEMIMA maple syrup (I saw them pour it) which baffled me. How can they be charging so much and serving food like this?. I cannot believe BlogTO ranked this Chicken and Waffles above the Drake Hotel's chicken and waffles even though that dish is ten billion times better. . For dessert, I got the Almond chocolate kisses, which were all in a big Pizza box. The waiter simply took one out of the pizza box, put it on a plate and served it to me. I was so dissapointed with this meal. . This place basically serves expensive Cafeteria food. Avoid at all costs.","There are 3 top pizza places in Las Vegas and this is one of them. When you walk in it feels like a New York pizza place even the booths remind me of the ones in some of the best fast service style joints in NYC. They have a 30 inch pizza! That's as wide as a standard door! And the price is great too. Lost a star (would only be half a star if I could) for the chicken philly cheese steak that was a little dry and burnt bun. Their pizza will is way above average though.","We've been regular customers since they first opened. As as fans of Pizzeria  Bianca and Grazzie, but not always up for the drive, we are entirely satisfied with the pizzas here. Friendly atmosphere and consistent quality are hallmarks. Service can be a little uneven, but they always manage to pull it off under Maria's watchful eye. Highly recommended.","Ordered two pizzas Sunday about 1:20. They told my wife it would be 45 min. After almost 2 hrs. the pizza showed up. We had called about 2:30 and asked where our pizza was. They told us it was in it's way and they would credit the money back to our card. Pizza was cold and kids were starving. Not calling them again.","A fairly decent Asian style restaurant at the airport. Slightly less expensive than the nearby options in the A20 concourse area. We had a couple of items and they were tasty. The egg rolls, while delicious, were swimming in grease. One note of caution, they aren't the fastest place, so if you have a tight connection and there's a line, it may be tight. Otherwise, give this place a try.  definitely better than the pizza place next door.","We tried to call ahead to order a pizza. No answer after several attempts and we thought this may be because of Monday Night Football. My husband goes to pick up knowing he'll have to wait because they never ever have \"hot and ready\" any time of any day. He places the order and the employee rings up the wrong thing. My husband corrects him, and 3 or 4 orders are placed after my husband's order. My husband watches the employee put the other orders in the oven. He then comes over to my husband and again asks what it is he wanted. My husband repeats the order. . After waiting and not paying close attention (mistake on his part, but then again. . . ) the employee asks again what we wanted as he hands the box to my husband. He of course comes home with the wrong product. We had ordered the 5 meat pizza that is $9 in the TV commercials and received stuffed crust pepperoni. . We tried to call back and of course no answer. This did not surprise us as we encountered this before going to the shop, and they did not even attempt to answer the phone while my husband was in the shop. I shot off a message to the company while my husband made a return trip to try to rectify the situation. I was told to take my comment to Customer Support. I tried and the site froze on the 3rd page. So, the whole company more or less \"backed up\" the bad service received at the shop. . Upon return, the employee got sarcastic with my husband insisting the product received was correct even after seeing the evidence that it was NOT.  We were able to keep the mistake but only received a $5 pizza as more or less an apology when we had ordered a higher-priced product.  . In the end we received 2 incorrect products. The first had to be reheated. It was mediocre at best when eaten but now has me ill with heartburn and stomach cramps. I guess it's safe to say BOTH the pizza AND the customer service have left very bad tastes in my mouth.","I don't see the point. It is a mess and ugly which fair enough is not news to anyone but now prices are high and not competitive. The same pizza is cheaper at no Frills, Shoppers and Lango's! And of course everything is strewn around in ugly fashion forget it","First time ever . . Staff are very friendly and the place it's clean . . . my recommendation will be the Italian panini or pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms","The service was fast. Great pizza. However, as someone with a shellfish allergy, I find it frustrating that this is yet another restaurant where cross-contamination is apparently an issue to the point where everything is grilled together, fried together, and so on.","Worst service. Overcharged - and lied to over and over again while the delivery guy tried to think of a reason to stick. There is no reason a medium pizza that's 14. 99 on your website should come to $25 before tip - especially when that's not what I was quoted on the phone. . My own fault for ordering from dominos in a moment of apartment packing craziness.","First time trying this Restuarant and truth be told I loved it. I was greeted as soon as I walked in and given a table. The decor is that of a fine dining establishment without the exuberant prices. My server Janice was a pleasure to deal with her service is second to none. I ordered the speciality pizza and it was delicious somewhat what you would get downtown in little Italy. I will definitely be back. Thank you Janice for a great dining experience","I love the South Point. The Steakhouse is amazing. It would get 5 stars if I was only rating the steakhouse. Best Lobster bisque I've EVER had. And the short rib and prawn combo was amazing. The Buffet is ok-first time we went to the Sunday Buffet it was Father's Day and I was disappointed but after a second trip (thank you Michael Kennedy) we received vip treatment and comped drinks which showed us the SP cares about its guests. Lotts of Asian/Mexican and good mashed potatoes and gravy. The shrimp were nice and fresh and my 3 year old loved the pizza.","Terrible!  The wings are hard and taste like them cooked them yesterday. The pizza was soggy and we found a piece of Long Hair in pizza!!! Will Never go again. I would give it zero stars if we could.","I have been going to the Essence of Unionville for approx. 7 years now. It has easily become our favourite place for Sunday brunch with family/and or friends. The service is exceptional as is the food selection. Once you are seated you are offered complimentary flute of orange juice. They have many breakfast favourites such as eggs benedict, sausage, bacon, made to order omelet station. The selection is great! Prime rib, 3-4 different entrees, fresh vegetables, roasted potatoes, several salads to choose from, fresh in house made sushi, crab legs, shrimp, mussels, smoked salmon, antipasto - the list goes on!. The desserts are out of this world and made in house by their very own pastry chef! Large selection of fruit, mousses, cakes, creme brulee (one of the best i've had!). . I was just there last Sunday for brunch with my hubby. There was an item i couldn't eat due to an allergy issue. One of the chefs offered to make me a plate so that it wouldn't include the item i was allergic to and personally brought it to our table for me, The servers are so nice, friendly and often come over to ask how everything is, topping up drinks, clearing plates away so often that you don't even have to ask! They always remember a face they've seen before, so we often get a server that we've had on a previous visit and they will remember what we like to drink whether its a soft drink with our meal or cappuccino with dessert. It is always super busy, but the service &amp; food is always top notch. . We've tried 2-3 places along Highway 7 for brunch and this has remained at the top of our list! If i had to choose 1 thing that i didn't like, it would be that they don't have a kid friendly menu for kids 8 &amp; under. Considering the fact that they are in a hotel where families do stay, it would be nice to see a couple of items (mini pizzas, tenders &amp; fries, pasta, waffles, pancakes?) for kids. Price for adults is $38. 50 and $20 for kids.  . They offer special brunches for Mother's Day, Christmas Day (weekday brunch is offered during the holidays in December), Easter (egg hunt for the kids!), New Years Eve &amp; New Years Day to name a few :)","Sometimes I feel like I spend way too much time here but its only because Riddle room is such a great place to be with friends. I always find a new board game to play each time I go and the staff are always there to teach the rules and get the game going. One of my favorite parts of the cafe is their great selection of video games from old school N64 to the newest Wii consoles. . . you'll always find people having a Super Smash brawl going on or racing along Rainbow Road! They definitely offer things that other board game cafes in Toronto don't have! . The escape rooms are also the best I've been to in town. Everything is so well set up and challenging that you really get to experience the fun of escape rooms. I've already played 3 of the 4 rooms at RR and managed to get 3rd best time for their Anatomy Room with my friends! Great memories made in each of the rooms. . Food wise. . . definitely try their pizza panini! My other favorites: Mango Basil Smoothie, Nutella Latte, Lavender London Fog! Coffee addicts will not be disappointed by their drinks. Also give the popcorn and chips a try! The cake is bomb too! Basically. . . I've tried and loved most of their menu! . If you're looking for a place to bring friends, RR is the place to be! Definitely check it out!","Had this pizza for first time last week. Very impressed with the quality. Pizza is very large square with lots of cheese and one of the best tasting sauces in Arizona. If you don't like it I'll pay for it. Just kidding. :-)","After noticing this place from living in the area I looked up the reviews and was excited to see that most gave this place rave reviews. . I ordered the deep dish Vito's special since it was highly recommended and went to pick it up. . you can tell this pizza had some weight to it. Pizza was super tasty, smothered with rich tomato sauce, peppers, onions and sausage on a soft cheesy perfectly cooked crust. My mouth is watering as I write this lol. I can't wait to try all of them. . Now I have lived in what I consider one of the nicer neighborhoods near Vito's and while its not The Biltmore this strip mall isn't as bad as most claim. It's actually really clean with some nice local businesses in it. I find myself lucky to claim this little neighborhood restaurant.","What a good value! A small salad then Hot fresh stuffed crust pizza, meat lovers etc. . I always special order a flat crust with bacon, sausage, pineapple and extra cheese :)). Warm gooey cinnamon rolls and brownie for desert. . Free wifi is nice. Friendly staff and clean place.","I grew up in Akron, but have moved to Phoenix, Arizona, . . . whenever I get back to North Hill I have to head to my favorite Chicken and Pizza ASAP! . I have loved this place since it opened when I was in Jr. High School . . . . THE FOOD : Great pizza but the Fried Chicken is the greatest, somehow they got garlicy goodness into the chicken! . . . Jojo's are amazing . . . THE SERVICE : is always quick and friendly! . All in all, Rasicci's is definitely something to write home about . . . I did !!","I happened upon this store while walking down walnut street with a friend. It has a hidden gem feel to it, since it is located in a kind of alleyway and down some stairs. The inside is crowded with goods, the aisles are close together and full of cute products and the walls are packed from floor to ceiling. The vibe is definitely similar to what one of these stores are like in Asia. The prices are fair, probably a bit higher than what you might find online but it more than makes up for it with the charm of a brick and mortar store that shopping online lacks. . The store lives up to its name, it has a huge assortment of kawaii things that would make good gifts, although you might be tempted to keep what you get for yourself. There's a ton of things to look through even if you don't have anything specific in mind. Before leaving my friend and I each bought a tokidoki unicorno blind box. I got Margherita which is funny because I just had the Margherita pizza down the street at mercurio's! Even the shopping bag was pink with a hello kitty theme. . If you happen to be in Shadyside with some free time, you should make a trip to this store. If nothing else, you're guaranteed some entertainment just looking around, but don't be surprised if you find yourself unable to resist leaving with a thing or two!","Got a pepperoni and sausage half sheet pizza from here last weekend and it was delicious. The pepperoni was awesome! The sausage pieces are huge like small meatballs. The sauce is thick and sweet which I like. Tons of cheese on this pizza which caused me to have an upset stomach aftward. Not their fault. I didn't go into the building to pick up the pizza so I can't say what it's like to eat in.","God only knows what took me so long to get here for brunch, but I finally arrived. . Yes, I came, I conquered and I left very happy (and buzzed!). I'll start with the only thing that really bugged me, which was the wait. From what I understand the way they serve here is a little different. I think everyone shares tables. But not even the sometimes slow service could bring my meal down, especially since they're so damn nice, too! . First of all, loving those bloody marys--like *really* loving them. They're perfectly spicy and when you serve them with big, crunchy pickle slices?! You have my whole heart. I also can't deny the glorious orange-y bubbles *ahem, mimosas* that were on special. The just-right mixture of a-little-bit-on-the-strong-side. Oh, yes. . Then, the menu. It's a great mixture of breakfast classics, healthy options, and badass lunch items. I picked the veggie omelet and then drooled over my boyfriend's blt with an egg. I mean, does it get better than that? Well, yes--when it comes on a croissant. Don't get me wrong, my veggie omelet was fresh and delish with perfectly grilled rye toast. I also loved the option of fresh fruit as a side. Although I snuck a homemade chip from my friend and it was perfectly cooked. . I was also very impressed by our check! With all the yummy, Sunday-Funday-ness happening, I was expected a massive fee. Alas, it was way less than I thought and methinks we shall return. I mean, you can't beat free parking. . I'll be back. . . to try that pizza!","Great restaurant. I am vegan and they were very accommodating with substitutions. The pizza is DElicious. The rapini is great. The gelato is awesome. I got the granita. Service was good. Only reason i gave 4 stars is the location and just a little over priced. But i will be going back on the regular. Just found my new favorite spot in laval.","I've only had the deep dish pizza from here so that's the only thing I can speak to. It is simply ridiculous. Maybe even obnoxious. Legit Chicago-style deep dish. The large has to weigh 15 pounds. I've only found a few places around town that have this style of pizza and Vito's is hands-down the best I've had. It's a behemoth. The crust is just unbelievable. It's actually almost approaching a flaky piecrust consistency. They get a double thumbs-up for accommodating my order once right before they were going to close for the night. They say to allow 45 minutes for this pizza and they actually had somebody wait a few extra minutes to close the store so I could come pick up the pizza. Awesome.","I love this place. We come here often and have been since it opened. I love the 4B burger (bacon, blue cheese, bbq sauce and onion ring), the chicken pesto sandwich is to die for as well!  I love how fresh everything is and that they get most of their veggies on site in their garden. The BBQ pizza is also good, as well as their shakes, malts and sundaes. We always bring company here especially when the weather is nice because you can sit outside and bring your (leashed) dog too :). Plus, they give you $10 towards your meal on your birthday!  Love this place!","We use to love Yeti's pizza, but the last few times I have noticed the spice level has increased, their meatballs Where so spicy I didn't enjoy them, and my son who use to love their pizza now can't eat it because it's to spicy, kinda sad that my favorite pizza place in Stoughton isn't what it use to be","I recently moved to this area and I was excited to try this place. I was not disappointed in the slightest. Their pizza might just be the best in Phoenix, the sauce is extremely flavorful and the crust is perfect. Mike and Alan in the bar are awesome dudes. Ive already made this one of my regular spots.","I am a New Yorker orginally and a pizza snob and I am sorry this is not the BEST in Charlotte. Although it is very very good it is still missing what Tony's in Ballantyne has perfected. . . crispy crust. Your pizza needs to crunch!  The taste and amount of cheese and sauce were perfect and the garlic knots delish as well, but not the best I'm sorry. I will be back no doubt if I am in the area and the price is great especially for the size. . . I would even say top 5 but no blue ribbon.","Best pizza this side of the Hudson River. Sure I've had better in Long Island &amp; the. 5 Boroughs but a lot worse too. This is the pizza joint \"around the corner\" in every way down to the cannoli &amp; Italian ices. Try the Sicilian (spot on) . . . . . . and just like back home, the slices are always better ordered individually (crispier) - but the pies are great. Family run (good people). Won't be disappointed, best NY Pizza in CLT hands down &amp; I've tried em all.","Just move to the area, found this on here. Let's just say it's amazing one of the best pizza places I have tried. The \"Real deal\" a must try, now the best part they have a groupon!!!!!!","Good East Coast Style Pizza. They cook the crust till golden brown. The sauce is good and not overpowering. For a change, order Eggplant as a topping. They fry it first before it goes on the pizza. Adds a nice flavor to a veggie pie. While not cheap, the pie is a good value.","This local pizza place has a wood burning oven and a great selection of pizzas. The ingredients they have are in the premium side of quality and the service is always expedient and friendly. The atmosphere is warm and cozy and usually is filled with a mix of people on dates and families. . The fresh garlic bread that they give you is a great start. It is garlicy and warm, careful not to fill up before your meal! It is super tempting. . Appetizers, both the breaded and grilled calamari is as you would expect which is good but not spectacular. Their Caesar Salad comes with fresh and crisp lettuce and is great to start with. I hate it when restaurants drench their salads in dressing and luckily they have never done this to me here. . For those who like veal, I've had the veal in peppercorn sauce, veal parmigiano, and the veal marsala. They are all tasty and filling with a stressor on filling. Make sure you're hungry or you're taking some home. The grilled salmon is my daughter's favourite dish. The fish is always cooked perfectly and the rice is a flavourful accompaniment. . Their pizzas are just the way I like it, think crust, light on the sauce with plenty of imaginative toppings. The Chiffonade and Bacon pizza is a great departure from the usual. The spinach pairs well with the salty bacon fontina and provolone cheeses. No tomato sauce on this one, so perfect for those who do not love sauce on their pizza all the time. The Puttanesca Pizza is our second favourite that is a great explosion of vegetarian flavour.","Great place for any kind of craving you're having - from pizza to pasta to wings - they have it and it's good! This is a good late night spot also and they have trivia and game nights. . We've had their Greek Pizza which is delicious; Pesto Cream Tortellini was very flavorful and creamy; Blackened Chicken Fettuccini could've used a little more cajun but no complaints; Wings (boneless &amp; traditional) have always been great; Spinach Artichoke Dip comes with Fried Pita which is a winner! Reasonable prices and good portion size.","Hey Sauce! . I heard some friends talking about how great your pizza was so I took the wife out to your restaurant last night to give it a try. I thought I'd provide you with our feedback as I have a feeling many other people may be feeling the same way we did about our experience. Lets start off with the good, the pizza was really good, our server was really good, the price of the food was decent, but that's kind of where it ends. Our first real impression of the place was when we were handed our menu's, both our menu's were beyond greasy and dirty and had food stuck to them, they were dingy/had bent corners and some of the paper had ripped off both of the menus this is a sign that nobody cares to wipe down the menus, and if nobody cares to even wipe down the menus it makes me wonder what else do they not wipe down regularly. When sitting around and taking in the whole atmosphere of the place, we felt it was a little dark and the restaurant as a whole needed to be wiped down. The garlic knots were really good, I still have mixed feelings about them, because most places that sell garlic knots dust them in parmesan cheese powder and some sort of garlic powder, and that's what I was kind of expecting here, but here I got fresh parmesan cheese and fresh chunks of garlic on top, don't get me wrong fresh is great but it was an ongoing battle to keep the garlic chucks and parmesan on top of the knot while eating it, where as if it were the parmesan powder I feel it would have stuck better and not have been so much work. The sauce that came with the garlic knots was amazing. Normally I like my garlic knots dipped in ranch, but I definitely liked your sauce over ranch last night. As far as your pizza goes it's really good. Let me start by saying I haven't found a place in the Vegas area that does pizza like yours, the thickness of the dough etc. We are transplants from California a little over a year ago and we've been on the hunt for a pizza with a crust like that. That's how 90% of all pizza places are in Southern California do it so that's what we've grown to like. Everything we have tried out here has seemed to try to spin off of New York thin style crust, so thank you for being a breath of fresh air for that. The pizza was hot when it came out as it should have, but for the life of me every slice I ate all the toppings would slide right off the crust, i felt like i might as well be eating a pizza casserole lol I thought that maybe everything was just too hot, but from the time I ate my first slice to the time I ate the last one, a good 15 minutes had passed and still the same situation. In regards to your soda glasses, you are using Samuel Adams pint glasses I think they were, these things were very frustrating, first of all not everyone likes beer and if you want to attract more families to your restaurant having every soda glass be a beer pint isn't very family friendly, but the most annoying part is every time I had a refill (at least 3 times) the ice was stuck in that center section and would drop to the bottom of the glass, just something to think about. Over all I liked the food, but all the other issues combined really make me want to rate you as 2 out of 5 stars. I was really hoping your restaurant would be added as a \"usual place\" for my wife and I but I think it's going to be in the once in a blue moon category. I hope business continues to grow for you guys and that you can dial down these little things and thrive as a business. Thanks again for the good food last night and good luck!","Absolutely amazing!!! This is as close to Chicago style pizza as you will find in the Valley. My husband and I have been out of the Chicago area since September and were desperately trying to find great pizza down here. Well, we had no such luck until we stumbled across Vito's. . It's quite a distance from our house in Goodyear, but worth every mile. . The service is great and we were able to speak with both owners on the two occasions we stopped in (definitely not our last time visiting) They are great guys and had no problem stopping what they were doing to chat with us. . The thin crust was great, cut in squares just like home :D . The deep dish, orgasmic. The seasonings the put on top of the sauce make it just like home, the crust is just right, sauce is just right and there is nothing bad to say about it!! . Each time we were in, we finished off the pizza with their homemade cannoli's. Let me just say, they are almost as good as my grandpa's were! Just missing the pistachios!  . The general location is a bit. . . well, not nice, but I've learned that the best food often comes from the least expected places. . My husband and I will definitely be back for more!","A super healthy alternative to a greasy on the go lunch or dinner choice. . The selections are all fresh, healthy, generous in portion, value priced and high quality. The staff were full of smiles too, so that was great!. The pizza looks delish, but I chose to build my own salad. It was really tasty, and I'm glad I found this place!","Always stop here when in Pittsburgh. . . Love the Italian wedding soup. . Great pizza!! Always get a lasagna to go for the next day. . Calzones are huge !! More than enough to share with the table. Best chicken parm sandwich you will ever have . Most stop in Pittsburgh","Great option for happy hour. Half priced pizzas, you can choose your toppings, and you even have the option to order a whole wheat crust. It's hard not to get excited about the options!. They have a great draft list as well, and there is always a cider on tap, which I love. . I love coming here with friends, especially because we can all order a few rounds of drinks, share a few pizzas, and never spend more than $40 for four people. Love it.","We had the pleasure of going for dinner and drinks at the State 48 Brewery. We arrived around 7 pm on a Friday night. We were greeted by the friendly host staff and promptly seated. Laura, our server, was friendly and very good at her job. We appreciated how well she took care of us. The beer: I was surprised and happy to find out they carried Dubina Bell Road IPA- it was one of my favorite AZ beers. They had a number of other local micro brews. My friend's wife had the coffee infused pale ale. She said she found her new favorite beer. For dinner we had The Boss pizza. It's a brick fired oven pizza and it was amazing. Large chunks of Italian sausage, pepperoni and roasted red peppers all with the right amount of fresh mozzarella cheese. We will defiantly be back to try some of the menu items and the other AZ beers","Sauce is either hit or miss. It's a bit on the expensive side and suffers from mediocre management. . It's one of those semi self-serve places; you walk up to a cashier to order, seat yourself, wait for servers to bring your order to your table and they might also come around to ask you if you need anything such as a drink refill. . The ambiance is hip, comfortable and open which makes it an ideal spot to catch-up with friends. . An entree item (pizza or salad) will cost you around $10. The pizzas are scrumptious but I suggest getting normal/thin crust over their newer thick/pan crust. Every time I've had the thicker crust it's been over-cornmeal'd. Being on a budget, I usually order the mushroom and artichoke bruschetta and a soft drink for just under $7. If I can spend a bit more I'll go for the caesar salad, though I skip the unsatisfactorily dry, cold chicken add-on. . The service is even more hit-or-miss than the food. Their staff seems to have a high turn-over rate with the exception of a couple great food servers. I've had visits where the employees have been fantastic, and others where the cashiers have acted like I was doing them a favor. During a particularly unfortunate and embarrassing incident a young woman incorrectly took my order and when the resulting price was significantly more than it should have been I politely corrected her. She then stormed off into the kitchen and yelled at the staff, \"HE DOESN'T WANT THE PIZZA ANYMORE!! HE WANTS THE BRUSCHETTA NOW. \" loud enough to be clearly heard from the dining area. I should have then called a manager but instead I accepted the $7 embarrassment and wouldn't return for nearly six months. . I've since returned to satisfactory experiences. Hit or miss . . . it's the risk you take.","The food is ok. Got the rustic Italian pizza for $17. 75. Reasonable price since it's medium sized and shareable. The desserts are obviously the thing here - the infamous white chocolate brownie. It's pretty big and so addicting. You can't just have one bite. I think it has some drugs in it because after eating it, I felt really woozy and sleepy like I was drugged. Be careful. . . tip for girls: not the best to order on a first date. . Service is okay. Our server was Spanish apparently. . . . but she can't speak Spanish at all. I think she's just trying to be friendly but she was extremely busy for the most part and couldn't provide an A plus service. I'm sure she does her best but the delivery is pretty slow. . Overall it's a typical restaurant with okay food. It's busy . . . I don't really know why. Most of the food here are basic and lack flavour.","This is paradise for beer connoisseurs. A range of beer that confuses, bedazzles and quenches you thirst for quality brews. The selection on lager and ales on tap as well as in the 'beer cave' make this place one of a kind. The special hummus, fries, hot dogz, and pizza make it the perfect hangout place any given day in Pittsburgh","A frightening fact was revealed to me before my second trip to Cleveland with my fiance's family for Thanksgiving: in the 20 years that she has attended the family Thanksgiving in Cleveland, his sister has never been within Cleveland city limits. Thank god we were able to correct that by visiting The Cleveland Museum of Art. . Instead of doing Black Friday like the rest of America, after visiting family in the morning we decided to go to the Museum of Art because apparently it's FREE! And who doesn't love free? Parking isn't free, but it also isn't terribly expensive, and since we had to drive there and there was no street parking, we were fine with paying for such convenient parking in their adjoining garage. . Our first stop within the museum's new renovated addition was the cafe for lunch - which is one of the best museum cafe's that I have been to. The food selection is great (salads, soups, fresh made sandwiches/pizzas. . . it all looks good), only slightly pricey but nothing that will break the bank, and the quality makes it easier to swallow. Great staff, too, very friendly. . Then. . . we explored the ENTIRE museum. Really not that hard for someone who has done the same thing in many NYC museums. The collections are extensive in historical scope, but on the small side for individual collections. I'm a huge ancient arts fan, and that area barely sated my curiosity. But the upper galleries are more packed, and more popular with visitors. By the end of our visit we were mentally exhausted and ready to sit and not read anything for the rest of the day. It is a well curated museum, and the design of the new building is lovely albeit somewhat confusing to navigate without going in at least one circle. But remember: ITS FREE!","You know what you are getting. Come on, this isn't the best pizza in town, but close enough to many homes in the Southern Ave and 19Th avenue basin.","Had a gift certificate and decided to finally use it. The place only had parking for two cars, and while parking my car set off their automatic door. . The lady at the counter was very nice and friendly. I got a strudel(tasty but not much filling), seeded rye bread (it was good) 2 little individual cheesecake squares (those were so good) a pizza bread (tasty, but too much sauce for me, but friends liked it like that and finished my part), and that came to a little over $25. For the cheesecake, I'll definitely come back here.","Our table had the steak frites, Ohio lamb bolognese and the boar pizza and they were all excellent. Flip Side is connected to the restaurant and you can also order from their beer list as well. We made a reservation on Open Table. I'll be back!","Yummy crust! I had the Ricotta pizza with pistachio pesto, mozzarella, and lemon zest. I found it a bit too oily for my taste but the roasted pistachios give it a yummy saltiness that makes you want to keep digging in until the last bite. My boyfriend had the Prosciutto with grape tomatoes and arugula, I had a bite of it and found it to be pretty good. The place is small and inviting, could seat max 20 people. Prices are good for the quality you get. For both pizzas including tax and tip 37$","The first time I tried this place, I was moving. Like. . . we don't even know where the dishes are anymore so we need to eat out of the cardboard box. I absolutely hate chain pizza places, so Yelp! steered me in the direction of Roberts. . It's solid pizza. It doesn't taste like chain-cardboard. The ingredients are fresh. . . and they have an amazing pesto pizza. . It's greasy. I feel like it would be the ultimate hangover pizza. But, it's really greasy. In a way that you just don't feel good about yourself after you've eaten it (at least when you're sober). But, it tastes good in the moment.","Good pizza. Not great. Not sure what all the hype is about. . We waited quite a while for our medium pepperoni pizza and it wasn't a busy night. When it finally arrived it was thick and gooey and I was expecting something spectacular. Wow was I disappointed. . It's not bad by any means. It's just not great. The sauce on top is a gimic, to what end I'm not sure. The sauce is average at best. I've had much better pepperoni. . Please tell me one of the other Chicago transplant pizzerias is worth the money. . Until then, we'll stick with that awesome place out of NY.","Good fresh food! Not too expensive. Salads are fantastic! Try the spinach &amp; strawberry salad. It is huge so you can split it and share a nice pizza with a friend. Never tried this chain before. Will have to look for it again.","My sister's friend worked here so we would stop in for pizza once in a while. They have a great menu full of pastas, salads and pizza. The service is friendly and the meal is not overly priced!","I love Nello's. . I'd like to write something prettier, something poetic. It's one of my favorite pizza places, and it deserves a little wordsmithery. But I'm too sated on deep-dish deliciousness to muster up my usual silver-tongued sweetness. . If you like Chicago-style pizza (and I do) made fresh with quality ingredients in generous portions, try Nello's. Their Hawaiian pizza is excellent. Any of their pizzas are, really. . Or you could smear some tomato paste and plasticky cheese on a piece of charred cardboard and call it \"pizza\". It works for Domino's, after all.","Wow I was impressed!!!. I purchased a voucher off kgb for $8 after a discount from a previous deal. That gave me 30$. Drove down with my bf and was a little turned off with the location (in a strip mall). After finding a nice seat on the patio we felt like we were in a nice scottsdale/dt phx area. They position the umbrellas to block the parking lot/strip mall behind you. I ordered a glass of pinot and my bf got run&amp;coke for drinks. We ordered a large caprese salad to share ($10. 99). It was great! They had a small for $7. 99 and this large one. It is a really great size, especially for a caprese salad, the basil was super yummy too! We ordered a large (12$ + 2$/additional topping) with mushrooms, kalamata olives, and half jalapenos (for him) and other half ricotta cheese (for me). It came out and we were in shock - it was HUGE! After our first bites we were addicted! It tasted so authentic and delicious. I can't wait to go back for that exact meal! The waitress was really nice and I was impressed how technologically advanced they were as they took orders on there iphones! Very cool! . We even think there pizza is better than CIBO (which we thought would be hard to beat). Super impressed with this little restaurant &amp; can't wait to go back again :)","There is a reason why the place is packed at lunch time. . . the pizza is AWESOME!  Dropped by before a ball game and we really, really liked it. Tried different slices - BBQ, pepperoni, buffalo chicken and plain - they were all great. Worth checking out.","You know when your friend has told you about a place  for years and then you try it and you're like, 'don't get it'? That's this joint. . We had an order of bread sticks, with a little cup of gas station nacho cheese for dipping. The sticks were OK.  The bread, in fact, tasted like when you were a kid and your folks made white toast with margarine and put garlic salt on it and called it garlic bread. I'm sure they have their devotees and it has some old school appeal, but meh. . We also had two thin crust medium pizzas. The size of a medium is small 12\" and I thought next time I would get a large minimum. One of the pies was half pepperoni and half sausage, the other a \"Delight\". They put the pepperoni under the cheese which is not my personal preference because it always makes me think, where's the pepa!  The Delight is a specialty order and comes with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions and green pepper. The flavor was good, but the green pepper was a bit overwhelming to me and drowned out the other more subtle flavors of the mushroom. The sauce is slightly sweet and you can taste the freshness of the mozzarella and to their credit both pies were well cooked. They deliver too, which is a bonus.  . Overall, it's A-OK, if you are looking for decent pizza, this is that place.","This restaurant has fantastic, authentic Italian food, great vibe, and wonderful service at a very fair price. My husband is Italian and was very glad to find Trattoria Italia as he is often craving the food and ambiance from home and after several years living here in the states he has finally found just that!! We have had their pizza, aranchini, Canoli, and cassata Siciliana. . . all were fantastic! If you're looking for a great Italian place to eat here in Vegas, I highly recommend Trattoria Italia!!","Damn the pizza is good! Bring it with pepperoni and ricotta, a couple of side salads and boneless wings and I'm good. It's about once a week for delivery. . UPDATE: The food is becoming more erratic from Caliente. The wings arrived tough. Again. The broccoli puffs got you the extra star.","A very sweet lovely admirable place on the way to Red rock canyon with a very nice service staff!. Best is that they do slices of both New York and deep dish pizzas which were very yummy. . The lunch pasta - Spaghetti marinara was delicious, tasted like homemade tomato sauce and just rightly flavoured! . Loved it!","I love the pizza, but I've had just 1 good experience here when the weather was gorgeous in the evening on the patio. The first time patio experience was bad because fruit flys (I think) were pretty bad. I had a fine in experience 2 weeks ago. It was cold so we decided to eat inside. The smell inside is like a dirty drain and flys again, but not as bad. The pizza was good, but I don't think I'll be going back.","Stopped here to meet a friend for a 'birthday dinner' after work on a Thursday evening. The weather wasn't great (heavy rain) so that could have attributed to the partially full bar and restaurant. It was early though, around 6:30, so if you're of the GenX range, this is a normal time, born after that, it is probably early!. Really fantastic happy hour specials. Domestic bottles and appetizers were half off. We shared the ballpark pretzel which came with two pretzel sticks and two dipping sauces of cheese or honey mustard. Very good. . For dinner I ordered some wings and a flatbread pizza. I immediately boxed half of each to enjoy at a later time, but to be honest, I didn't enjoy the bianca flatbread either time. It just had little to no taste to it. The wings were decent though.  . Service was ok. I noticed the wait staff going in and out of the bathroom a lot to use their cell phones. But food came out quickly and was served hot, so not real complaints.","Definitely a place to go. . . . we went there after our show in December. Most places were closed at 11:30 p. m. or close to it. . . but we were so happy that Pizza Rustica was open. . the serving staff were courteous and very accommodating. they gave us so many options, changed the topping on the 'set' pizza.  when he realized that one of our guests could not drink (she is pregnant), he was very attentive because he is a father. He shared his loving stories about his son while serving good pizza and drinks. . The wood oven pizza was good, tasty. . . but man, their service is outstanding. . . . A nice gem of a place to go . . .","Delivery was nice. Fries had a bucket of Salt on them. Me and my brother gagged!!!Hummus wasn't fresh. Your sausage  pizza was rotten. Tasted like Mold. . . Terrible terrible food!!!!","So I couldn't tell you what Gus' pizza tastes like because they wanted a $7 service charge (before tip) on an $11 order to deliver anything. Classic craphole that will be out of business soon.","I got the carry-out XL pepperoni special. It was quick, hot and delicious. No fancy frills, but tastes like real pizza which is more than can be said for many or the pizza places in the area. They also have a variety of other food, like french fries and snacks, that will keep the picky eaters happy. . Their other pizzas seem pricy, but not having tried them yet I can't vouch one way or the other.  . Service was friendly and quick. If you're the unsociable type who's bothered by staff speaking foreign languages, just stay away. Personally, I couldn't care less when the food is good.","I visited this restaurant for lunch today with my team from work. I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars because I absolutely loved the inside of it and the atmosphere. The interior is so nice and unlike any other restaurant I've been inside. Very creative. I also absolutely loved the salad I had. Being that I have wheat and lactose allergies, what I can eat there is extremely limited. I ordered a salad, with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, shrimp, chicken and balsamic dressing. The salad was sooooo good. I was nice and full after I ate it. . My team members ordered pizzas and pasta dishes and those looked really good. I may try one one day.","This place is. . . okay. I've been here for Sunday brunch 3 times. Twice as a group of 4 and once as a couple. I'll start by saying it's definitely not worth $35/person. If you get a groupon or some other good deal, it's ok. The food here is mediocre and the coffees are SO SMALL. They make the tiniest lattes I've ever seen. The desserts are all store-bought. The pizza is decent but nothing special, same with the pasta. There's one salad option and it's just spring mix. 2 types of meats available - lamb and beef - at the carving station. Unfortunately, they were both really cold. . Most of the food was kind of cold by the time you got your plate to the table, which made it a lot less enjoyable. The interior is pretty nice.","This place is a wet, dirty diaper. . The dirty food matches its dirty neighborhood. . Their slow drivers on Oxy can't figure directions from a mile away. When delivered, their pizza was lukewarm and tasted what I assume was old lady's socks. This food will give raccoons nightmares. . Perfect food to give to an enemy or gf you are breaking up with.","Buddy and I ate here on Sat/13 Jul about 1:30 pm. . - The complementary bread/cheesy bread twists were ok, and they did come with olive oil and a spicy dip. . - We split a $28(?) Gotham pizza which was large enough to feed us both. It was basically a pepperoni and sausage pizza.  . - I'll give it 4-stars because it's inside the Aria, the food was good and service excellent, pricing fairly standard for a Strip eatery. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.","Came in for lunch with my boyfriend and kid. We had pepperoni pizza, hot wings and garlic knots. Service was quick and they were really nice. . The wings are really good. Probably my favorite thing. . The garlic knots are pretty good too. We got them so quick we had to wait a few for them to cool down. . The pizza was pretty greasy but tasty. Will be back.","Great pizza and wings. Order the huge pizza for special occasions and our guest love the food. Good prices for a lot of food.","Fabulous woodfire pizza!! All their late night over the counter pizzas were deeeelish!!! I killed 3 slices! And they are not small slices and Iam not a big girl, just have a great big appetite for good pizza!  Perfect crust, cheese galore, not too doughy w a good amount of sauce. Worth to eat there twice during my wknd stay!! Cheers!","Food was ok, not the best just ok. Service could have been better, we ordered a large pizza, 20 wings and garlic knots. . . They brought out everything and forgot the wings! And never even told us anything about how long it would be, we finished the pizza and Knots before the wings even came! We where told that they forgot to put them in! BS! And the manager never even came over to apologize. . . . Horrible customer service!","We stopped her again on the way home from a trip to the valley. I ordered a sausage pizza and medium spicy wings to go. The service is great, the food is perfect everytime. I appreciate the employees there. . . . always pleasant and consistent. It's always clean. I enjoy the tv when I am waiting for my to - go order.","Really enjoyed this place. The pizza was very good. Fun drinks. The prices were right. The service was GREAT! We will definitely be back. Alex was great and very knowledgeable.","I passed this place until the other half had a craving for pizza and suggested we try it. I have to say that the first time we ordered it, it was AMAZING.  We have since ordered here when in the mood for pizza and it has been consistently tasty. Decent sized pizzas with great taste. I tend to like to make my own so their competition is my own cooking :)  When I don't feel like cooking and need a treat after a long week, this pizza is a good one. Don't blink, otherwise you may miss this location!  It is right beside a gas station just off to the side. We missed it the first time!","$20 pizza and wings is a great deal. The sauce was tasty and the wings were perfect. Management please start carrying blue cheese for the wings.","Custom Built Pizza = Very Happy Belly!. We accidentally stumbled onto CBP when we were going to a different place in the area. My hubby was set on the other place but when we saw the big lunch special sign out front, we had to investigate. I mean ANY PIZZA for $6. 95 would get anyone's attention I think (this special is Monday-Friday 11am-3pm. )  When I went in to grab a menu to check out, I was sold on pizza for lunch just from the smell of the place!  There was no eating a boring sandwich after smelling the delicious pizzas baking in the oven. . I really liked the whole idea of this place as well. It was like going to Subway where you walk down the line and point to the items you want on your pizza. The choices are quite numerous and plentiful. The toppings all looked super fresh and colorful. There were several options for crusts, sauces, cheeses, veggies, and proteins. There must be at least 1000 combos you can make, if not more. They also have already designed pizzas, if the toppings are too overwhelming for you. Since we were there for the lunch special time, we could actually get unlimited toppings, if we had chosen to do so. Instead we went with a classic pepperoni pizza and a white pizza with extra mushrooms because everything is better with mushrooms!  Both were super tasty and had so much flavor. The thin crust was crisp with a great crunch. The cheese was ooey gooey and browned just perfectly. The pepperoni was spicy and delish!. The best thing was our pizzas were prepared, cooked, and boxed up in 5 minutes flat. That is some awesome pizza service right there. We very much enjoyed the pizzas and had nothing left over afterwards because we are pizza piggies.  . I would give this place a solid 4 stars but the staff here totally pushes them to a 5 star rating. Maurice was working the counter when I arrived. He could tell I was new and slightly confused, especially since I was at the wrong end of the counter trying to order, so he took me under his wing and showed me the light. He walked me through everything and was describing each step with the greatest of detail. He spoke about the pizza as if it was his first born child!  His descriptions made you want the pizza right that second. He totally made the experience amazing. Both of our pizzas were works of art created by the one and only Maurice the Pizzaman!  Maurice alone makes CBP a 5 star joint!  Go Maurice!!!","Came for a quick bite before a show because we love the atmosphere of being down at the LINQ so we always sit outside on the patio to enjoy the music and people watch. . This time we tried the Crispy Brussel Sprouts with smoked bacon, potato, &amp; fried egg which was a huge appetizer for 2 people but could have eaten it as my meal!!!The egg on top really made the dish. . We also shared the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich with tomato sauce, mozzarella, &amp; arugula on ciabitini bread which was mouth watering good! We love the pizzas here, but unless you're REALLY hungry, they are great to share. Then if you're still hungry, choose something else from their great menu. . The service is always good and the servers are SO knowledgeable. You'll LOVE this place!!!","Fantastic pizza, especially the deep dish. I called with a coupon from one of those Citipass books and had no trouble using it. I did pick up and the pizza was ready by the time I got there and they got the order exactly right. No issues at all.","The best pizza ever. When you crave a good pizza and Rays is the only one that will suffice you know you're hooked. We love their wings too. Yum!! All around. . . .","Kudos to the Minder Binder savers who preserved the wonderful aspects of the historic Minder Binders, but scrubbed it up so nicely!!  It is better than ever!  All the employees are extremely friendly and the food is very good and reasonably priced. It would be so nice to have a few more vegetarian options. Offering a veggie patty in lieu of the meat on the burger choices would be tremendous!  That little change would bring me, and other vegetarians, back more frequently. Even though the veggie pizza and the fun salad are delicious, I can only repeat them a limited number of times. Great fun though!","This place provides a consistent service and does not try to be something that it is not. I took visitors here after our wedding and we had the fries and chili dogs. The huge portions and options to dip your fries makes this place a destination when you want food that is not healthy. Their burgers when you want one outside of typical fast food joints are exactly what you are looking for as you can load them up with toppings that stay on the burger and make it taste better. Pizza here is when you want a \"greasy\" pizza that you use a napkin to dabble away the melted droplets from the cheese.","We're in our 30s with no children and still love this waterpark. We typically go during the week, and, if you arrive early, you can snag lounge chairs under a cabana for relief from the sun (so you can actually spend a long time there). . We love how it feels uncrowded, with not much waiting for slides. The staff is friendly and helpful. The grounds are spotless (bathrooms need a little more upkeep, though). Only one slide was not working when we were there. . I like how they have lots of levels of play. Small splash pools for little ones, and everything from tiny slides to fully enclosed twisty ones. Some slides require a tube, which is readily supplied by the ride. You can rent a raft for just $5, and you get $1 back when you return it. The raft is for wave pool. . We love the free parking, and you can always print a coupon from their website. . We finally had lunch there and have to say, it's really not good. The chili on the chili cheese fries is terrible, although you do get a large portion. The cheeseburgers were small and barely lukewarm. The pizza is probably your best bet. We saw a mom buy a whole one for about $16. She asked them to slice it into 10 pieces to feed more kids. Everyone in line wished they had ordered it!","This is Nook's second location, located within the Hilton Garden Inn in Downtown Phoenix on Monroe Street. I originally reviewed their Indian School spot and gave them a solid three stars due to having respectable but somewhat pricey foods, with lots of hits and misses with their menu. And honestly, in terms of the overall experience, I'd say that this location is more or less the same. The restaurant itself has a cool setup and unlike the spot on Indian School, also features an outdoor patio. . We started with a half-order of their fig bruschetta, which includes fig jam, prosciutto, asparagus, and a bit of goat cheese. This item has always been consistently good, while their polpetinne (fried risotto balls) were fine as well. . We've experimented with their menu before by trying their bolognese and being disappointed. I assume their chicken marsala is still very good, while I'd imagine that their poutine (gravy fries) also delivers. We decided to skip these options, however, and just get a diavolo pizza. . Nook's pizza is a bit weird. Ingredients are fine and crust has always had solid flavor, but their pizzas are always served incredibly dry and floury, in stark contrast to what we're used to at most places. I guess it's more of a subjective thing, but I never find myself to be impressed as much as I wish I could be. . For dessert, their options are a bit different than what we remembered. We decided to order their buttercake, which seemed more like a cheesecake than anything else. The dish heavily incorporates graham crackers, including a ganache and an actual miniature graham cracker itself. The dessert was good, but if you're familiar with buttercake, you might be a little thrown off. . Our server was incredibly slow - and I mean painfully slow in comparison to the usual quick service we receive at Nook. The place wasn't very busy for a Saturday night, so I'm not sure what that was about. . Prices are a bit high, which I've never felt are fully justified. Overall, I'd still recommend Nook as a place to try out. Although the food isn't quite as impressive as I think it could potentially be, it definitely has its fair share of fans.","Char is an amazing family restaurant with great pizza and atmosphere. Highly recommend taking the fam.","Giving this place the benefit of the doubt. Open for 19 days. The food was good. The pizza was ok. The linguini and clams was good.   . You could tell they were still working all the kinks out. We didn't have a reservation so we sat at the pizza bar. . Atmosphere and ambiance was nice.","I ordered an Italian calzone and a buffalo chicken salad for delivery. They arrived in about 45 minutes, which given that it was a Saturday I thought was reasonable. The delivery guy was very nice and polite and called me as he got to the front door of my building. . The calzone was huge--imagine a medium sized pizza folded in half. It was actually delivered in a pizza box. It has lots of ricotta and mozzarella cheese, plus some Italian meats. The bread part of the calzone was very good. . The buffalo chicken salad was also a quite generous portion and was exactly as described:  mixed greens (arugula, baby spinach, etc. ), red onion, green bell pepper, french fries, grilled chicken tossed w/ buffalo hot sauce and cheddar cheese. I got the homemade ranch dressing and it was really good.  . I thought given the portion size, the freshness of the ingredients, and the fact that the calzone was made from scratch (the dough, sauce, etc. ) it was reasonable. It will easily be 3 meals for me.","Worst delivery service in the Las Vegas Pizza Market. The first time I ordered pizza it took 1 hour and 30 minutes to get my pizza. This time I ordered, told them on the phone I would pay cash and they show up and tell me they don't have change for my 2 twenty dollar bills. Really? What a mess this place is. I have no idea how they stay in business. Time for me to give some of the other places a try.","This is a great pie. My father hates pizza but loves this place. My only complaint is that there are not enough pepperoni on the pizza but that isnt enough to cost it a 5 star rating.","Great pizza!! And I'm from NYC I should know! Very nice employees! Smells so good! I really loved the pizza slices I ordered and the employees were very nice as well. I can't wait to eat here again soon. I only wished they delivered further than 2 miles away!","Went there on Halloween day for lunch. We sat at the bar. The bartender was nice but so overwhelmed. . . even though the place was practically empty. There were five couples seated at the bar and he managed to get every order incorrect. Service took forever. Probably waited 15 minutes just to order a drink. Again it was not busy at all. Now for the food. We had a pizza and a caprese salad. The caprese salad was awful. It was on a bed of iceberg lettuce and really lacked any flavor whatsoever. The pizza, on the other hand, was wonderful and that's why I give Crust 3 starts. Only for the pizza. Since this was my first visit, I will be back and hopefully the service and the other food items are better than this visit.","Consistently great service with a smile and a superb Spicy Fennel sausage thin crust pizza. We drive from Mooresville just to see y'all !!!","A) Great staff! Everyone is super friendly!. B) Buffalo chicken pizza is outstanding. I was skeptical at first with the French fries on it, but it was amazing.","I love Naked City Pizza. This was my first trip to their Tavern -- a much better location with more room, better parking, than their location on Paradise (the only location I had been to). It's hard for me to choose what to get here. So many tasty options. I always order too much, then take the extra home. This time, I got a small poutine which was excellent. Then got a Guinea Pie. A new chef, I hear. The pizza was a little under-done (which means it didn't have that crisp, caramelized crust) -- that's why only 4 stars. I'll look forward to a return on my next trip. Still, great food.","PASS THIS PLACE- The food and service here were awful. . We came into this place with a reservation when we arrived in Vegas in September and right off the bat were not greeted at all. We should have known from there the experience would be bad. . We sat down and were immediately rushed into ordering our food and drinks- after our drinks came, which were blah, our food  finally came. We ordered a traditional pepperoni pizza and a side of their so-called-famous meatballs. . The pizza was SO GREASY that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. When we picked up a slice it would fall apart bc it was so greasy. . The meatball was just ok. Nothing to write home about. . When our server came back to check on us we mentioned to her that the pizza was on the greasy side. She then said in a very rude tone that \"That is how it is and that is normal for ALL pizza\". I was offended with that remark. She has no idea what kind of pizza is normal if she thinks THAT was normal. . Any who, the manger came over and had a very similar attitude. . We paid our expensive tab and left- never to return, as I urge you to do the same.","I have been wanting to try this restaurant since they first opened. Finally got the chance to come due to Winterlicious! The restaurant is divided in two sections: dining &amp; grab-n-go. It was a bit dark when first walked in and the waiting area was crowded. Lucky we got seated immediately. The service was good; gave us a detail descriptions whenever we had questions on the menu and refilled water all the time. . Ordered pork terrine for appetizier; I was worried the terrine will be too salty. It got balanced out with a little salad and pickles on the side. (Wish the pickles can be more sour for my personal perference. ) The portion for smoked turkey pizza was huge! Good that it was thin and crispy. I couldn't really taste the sauerkraut and onion from it though. Thousand island dressing didnt over power the turkey. Couldnt finish the warm toffee pudding because I was already too full. . Will come back again for their regular price menu!","The positives: staff was friendly and the beer was cold. That's it. . Two kids spaghetti and meatballs was disappointing. Noodles were cooked fine, the meatballs were small and bland, and the sauce was runny and wasn't nearly enough to coat half the noodles let alone the entire plate. And for $6 each that's ridiculous. . . We order the Mama's Supreme pizza. The order took well over 30 min for the pizza. Half the crust was burnt. The toppings were limited and the flavor was blah.  . Very disappointed and won't be returning.","Excellent pizza and salad special. Try the cannolis made in house to order. Definitely be back","It's National Pizza Day!  No better way to celebrate than our local pizza joint. Pizza By Robert is our favorite non-chain pizzeria west of the city. . Their pizza is always cooked just right. Crispy crust but never burnt, and the hint of sweetness in their sauce is an excellent addition. The crust reminds me of Pizza Hut but in a good way (crunchy)  . If your looking for a good hand tossed pizza check them out. Medium 1 Topping $9","I tried their brunch sampler menu the other day. It's pretty hard to find as it's hidden inside an office building. The restaurant in itself isn't too shabby. It's a bit small so if you have a big group, you're probably going to be really cramped together. . I tried their pizza which was delicious, extremely thin crust which I liked. Their sandwiches were also really good. I have no idea what they did to it but the crispiness combined with the bacon and sauce just made it soooo good. I also got to try their french toast which was ok. Nothing too special about it. Out of everything I tried, I actually liked their sandwiches the most. . This place is probably best to hit if you want a casual lunch/brunch. Just remember, their brunch is only available on Saturdays.","French fries were amazing!!! Drinks are spot on! . We had the bbq chicken pizza and the meat lovers, both were awesome!! . Friendly staff, and quick service!","What an amazing food adventure. I wish I had an additional stomach in order to be able to sample more of the amazing bites. . the Bad: So the space was a bit on the crowded side and there really not much room to maneuver around. Layout was kind of strange, but it fit the overall space provided by the art museum. Weather was kind of warm, but that's not something that can be controlled, contrary to popular belief. Who brings their kids to events like this? There is a time and place, this was not it. Leave the kids and strollers at home. Pretty weak bad list, I think. . the Neither here nor there: Beer selection was pretty weak, but I feel this was by design since it was a showcase of food and wine. Beer has not quite made the foodie scene in Phoenix. There were some strange selections/choices of food by the restaurants themselves that seemed odd. It's been pretty well documented out in the web, but Federal Pizza not having pizza was strange. There were only a handful of examples of this, so really a minor thing. . the Good: Great selection of restaurants. Amazing selection of wines. The food being put out by all (even the strange choices) was tops. Add to the fact that they were not cooking inside their actual restaurants, but outside, and these wonderful chefs/cooks/helpers deserve a standing ovation. I can't believe the level of quality and tastiness that some of these chefs are capable of. What a treat for all the senses. Really a fantastic time and I can't wait till next year.","Valentines Day dinner. . . Cozy and warm, sat at the bar for drinks before dinner. They were out of Dewars; apparently a casualty of eating in a WINE bar. . We had an antipasto plate at the bar that was wonderful. . . The best part was the port wine cheddar. Not much to look at but very creamy. My wife and I shared a grilled salad and pizza for dinner. Both were super. We will definately be back.","Under new management, this place is great!. We didn't try any of the alcoholic beverages, but tried out a good variety of the menu:. the pickle chips were a unique choice for appetizer. the taco pizza was a tasty speciality pizza. the pepperoni pizza was a classic pizza with the perfect amount of toppings. . The real showstopper was the service here!. Our server was knowledgeable and attentive. The owner came over and talked and bonded with us . It was a great experience! Can't wait to try out a grinder!","Decent food but don't expect anything fancy. Watch out for their strange payment options. . . they got the best of us and made a very nice profit on us tourists. We had the house salad (just ice burg lettuce and a few toppings), poutine, and a small pizza. When it was time to pay, they said they only take cash or debit due to high credit card fees. Turns out, they only take CANADIAN debit cards, so that left the cash option for us. We didn't have enough CA dollars, but she agreed only to take US dollars at a 1:1 (current exchange rate was actually about 1 US to 1. 20 CA). So we gave her $40 us to pay for a $29 CA meal, got back $10 CA. . . So the meal cost us quite a bit more and we were left with Canadian dollars that we will never use as we were headed back to the US. We even offered to pay the credit card fee above the meal price, but she declined. . . . they are clearly using some deceptive money practices there. Put a bit of a sour note on our visit to this local restaurant.","This place is amazing! The food is so spectacularly fantastic! We had a wonderful waiter, Paulo (I believe). He was friendly and attentive. Did I mention how wonderful the food is? It really is and its fairly reasonably priced for the high quality of food received. Our table ordered lasagna, chicken marsala and quattro formaiga pizza. We didn't have a single complaint. In fact, it was funny how many sound effects we were all making (yum, oooo, ahhh). I can't recommend this place enough.","opens late, close to u of t, always hot pizza, generous amounts. mm-mmm","The last time I was at hot rocks, I had the most interesting and delicious pizza experience. If i had written a review that time i would have given it 5 out of 5. Oddly, I hadn't been back in quite a while until just recently.   . This time I ordered the Macedonian  pasta with a starter green salad. The salad was unique. . . but not good at all. It was waaayyy  overdressed. It tasted like every ingredient had been pickled  and then doused in lemon juice. I couldn't handle more than a couple mouthfuls before I gave up. . The pasta. . . looked good. . . . sounded good. . but again was overdressed. There was so much dried basil in the sauce. . and instead of a light pesto. . The dish was swimming in oil. I'm not kidding. It was more like oil soup with penne noodles.  . I'm was supremely disappointed. But I will say the service was excellent. The server did come by and asked how everything was but I didn't have the courage to send my food back. . . . Not saying this place doesn't know how to do pizza. . . and maybe I came on a bad night. .  but I would be wary of ordering the pasta and salad.","Originally went here because of a restaurant. com certificate. . The place was busy, but we received great service from our servers, and the food was good. . We had the thin crust Monster pizza - yum!","Wow, that was a pricey meal!  a small pizza and a burger with lemonade cost us 30 dollars.  . A nice place to visit and check out. Once. But the price/value is a little askew for me.  . I did love the lovely outdoor patio and my burger was fantastic. I tried the Fontina burger. A creative and tasty burger, but I think the Fez Burger is the best \"creative\" burger in the Valley. Nevertheless, I enjoyed mine bunless to save a few calories and carbs.  . The pizza was not very memorable, but we did order the pepperoni pizza. It tasted just fine. . They must have one of the coolest restrooms in the Valley. Very neat. Definitely remember to wash your hands before you eat. . Return Factor: 20%. Kid Factor: 80%","Bleh. . Maybe their pizza slices + pop deals are decent value, but my standard medium regular pizza (plus pineapple - yum!) was only a teeny tiny marginally fractionally  bit nicer than the same order at the neighbouring Pizza Pizza, but three dollars more expensive. . I'm also pretty sure one of the staff members who dealt with me was high. . Judge me all you like, but I'll head back to Pizza Pizza next time.","The best word I can think of to describe this place is authentic. From the local art to the hand crafted coffee drinks and gourmet pizzas. And the patio is an awesome place to hang out in the sun with a coffee or with friends for drinks after a mountain bike ride.","My wife and I are from Rockford Ill and this place brought us back home. We drove an hour and it was well worth it. Spot on fantastic Chicago style pizza. We got the regular thin crust and brought a small stuffed  home. Loved both. . excellent service. We will be back. . . . . .","The pizza is the best I've had. It's loaded!!!! With topping and delicious. Warning the Meat Pizza has so much meat on it your hands will be greasy LOL. I've also had the Mediterranean Pizza and it was Perfect. I was shocked they served fried chicken OMG the way it is seasoned it is like old school southern style Sunday dinner chicken. It's so crunchy and seasoned just right. The potato wedges are huge and filling and also have flavor. I will be a regular here for sure.","I was in Vegas with the family . Good pizza Great staff and great price. . Will be back when I'm going down Sahara BLVD checking out my next spot. .","Best pizza ever! . Yummy thick crust! Mm mm mm !  . But they wouldn't give me a water cup cause they were out and said I could buy a soda for 1. 25 and put water in it. . . Yeah no. . Super parched. . But either way the pizza is DANK!","If you're looking for CHEAP, I guess this is the place.  . They serve all of the pizza and salad you can eat for $5. 49 (soft drinks are $1. 79, or free for seniors). There's a temporary lunch special for $4. 99 including drink. . The two types of salads were fresh tasting and good. They had a variety of pizza to choose from. While the pizza LOOKED really good, the taste didn't match the appearance. It really tasted like inexpensive frozen pizza that you'd get from a grocery store (I didn't see them making it, but I wouldn't doubt that it was made in a factory somewhere and shipped frozen) and the crust tasted like cardboard. . The place really isn't meant for \"Pizza Snobs\" to enjoy a quality pie. It's meant to be a cheap alternative to McDonalds, and it seems as though it's marketed that way (photos of kids and teens eating pizza hanging all over the walls, arcade in the back, \"Macaroni and Cheese Pizza\" as one of the types). . There were teens and families with small children everywhere. I was the only person not there with someone under 18.","I love Pj Pizza but my order was wrong. Oh well it happens. I called and spoke to Anna (assist mgr) she fixed it all up in a jiffy. No arguments, no fuss and all taken care of. Nice to feel like your business matters. Especially in a competitive biz like pizza. . :)","This delivered a pizza to with all the cheese over one one side. When I called to complain the owner was very very rude . I will never go there or buy anything again. . Sent money back","Cashier Takes my order for (the last of) cheese pizza while I wait in line to buy cigarettes. . Woman ahead is told her total, her response \"Oh yea I forgot, can I get that cheese pizza\" . WHY ask me if you're going to make ME wait? I didnt forget to order, she did. She should have had to wait. University student vs an employee on a LIMITED break. Which was explained to her, minimum wage doesnt inspire much care for the customer. . . Fuck this spot","First, it took about 5 minutes of waiting before we were even noticed. Then the host told us just to sit wherever (why have a podium and a host if tou have open seating?) Our host said it would be another 15 minutes because they stoke the fire at 4, but when we sat down our waiter said it would be 45 minutes. We waited and when we got our pizza it was extremely soggy, we couldnt even hold it without one hand on the bottom. Our waiter only showed up once to half fill my water. Overall not a good experience. Go to a different grimaldi's","Lebanese Bakery Cafe and Desserts is located on Birchmount Road South of 401. . I would never notice this place because it is like tugged inside a factory looking complex. . The inside decoration is really simple but quite comfy with plenty of seats and even a little fireplace with armchairs. . There are 2 areas you can order food from. . one is the bakery for pizza, fatayer(pies), shawarama and salads. . . We tried some of the little appetitizers ($1 to $1. 50) each which are all really tasty. I love the dough! It is firm but fluffy and have a lot of texture. Hey and almost all of them has spice inside! . The other area is devoted to sweets and drinks. Almond and Pistchio bakalwa. I have to tell you I do have this weakness over flaky pastries. Though both of them are really sweet but oh flaky shells dripping with honey. . . great to enjoy over a cup of dark arabic coffee. . .","We are so happy that tailgaters can choose Surprise az, . Love the food, love the pizzas, and wings, but sometimes we feel like we're invisible. The daytime service is not fast enough. We eat there several times a month.  . If the servers could pay just a little more attention to those who want to get their checks and leave that would be great. We will be back!","Good fresh food in an industrial setting (loud acoustics). Pizza is amazing and so is the spicy Mac n cheese. Two things that I don't like: 1 the drink prices are too high.  (Two glasses of average wine shouldn't cost more than one of the pizza entrees. ) And 2. they charge $9 for 4 slices of garlic bread and $14 for three medium sized meatballs, which seems a little excessive for what you get. Maybe if they charged a little less for drinks and apps, they might sell more. The cigar room is good but the ventilation isn't. You can smell cigars sitting outside the room so that's not too good when you're tying to enjoy a nice meal. I've eaten here several times and will likely be back, I only wish they were a little more reasonable around the drink and appetizer prices.","We got a insider tip from one of the relatives of the owner that the pizza to try was the Euphoria as it's a little different than the regular and his favorite. So was it good. . . . yup it was. . . . very, very good. Pizza had a great crust, chewy on the inside, crispy on the outside and quite tasty (due to the smothering of garlic butter). We added some meat thing to the toppings since the Euphoria is vegetarian but honestly we probably should have just left it alone. . Can't say how other things on the menu are as we've only ever had the pizza but the plates on the other tables sure looked good.","Great pizza and great beer. Don't be deceived by the coffee house look like I almost was.","Living in a town of spas and resorts, with so many local \"stay-cation\" destinations, there is fierce competition to offer the best amenities, facilities, pools, spas, dining, and relaxation. My number one choice for all of the above is Firesky. Romantic, intimate, superior accommodations, outstanding food and drinks, unbeatable amenities, outstanding customer service from the front desk to the bar and grill. . Things I love about Kimpton Hotels as a whole:. 1. The \"In Touch\" loyalty program:. -Customizing your stay and an added surprise. . Not only can you customize your personal preferences such as the type of pillows you want on your bed, or whether you want a yoga mat in your room, but you receive a $10 \"raid the mini bar\" card upon each check'in. . -The mini bar is fantastic with everything your snack-loving heart could desire from Goodie bags with gummy bears to Clif and Luna bars, organic dried fruit, Snickers, nuts, and even more specific essentials such as Tylenol, band-aids, and intimacy kits ranging from $3. 50-$6. 00. . -Free Wi-Fi in your room and around the resort. . 2. Meeting all of your needs with amenities galore. . -This is a big one! . Perfect example of exceeding expectations here was although our room did not have a DVD player, the front desk had one sent up and connected for us, free of charge.  (I have stayed in other local hotels where there was a $25 charge just for having one in the room). . -A long list of complimentary items in (case you forgot them at home) such as computer/mobile chargers, feminine hygiene products, razors, clippers, USB cards, and humidifiers. . -Take one of their custom designed bikes around town, and you can even add a gourmet picnic basket. -Complimentary transportation within a 3 mile radius, perfect for going out in Old Town. . -Hosted complimentary wine hour every evening at 5p in the lobby. . 3.

Bigelow Bath and Body Products. -Funky and comfortable bath robes, ours were cheetah print. -Fully stocked honor bars. -Flat screen televisions. 4. Exclusive offers sent to your email. . -Often that means you can get a room here for $99 - and if you find a better deal on another site (i. e. Hotels. com) they will not only match but either give you an additional credit, or in our case - matched the price and sent a bottle of chilled champagne to our room. . 5. Eco friendly practices:. -They recycle everything from phones to batteries. . -They buy organic coffees and teas . - They serve organic wines during their evening complimentary wine hours. . - The cleaning staff uses green products. . 6. Pet Friendly. . -Pet beds and food and water bowls delivered to your room. . -Your furry friend even gets a welcome board with his or her name. . Things I love about Firesky:. 1. Taggia Restaurant. .

The Property. . Small, intimate, easy to get around - has the look and feel of a Hawaiian resort. . -Torch-lit Pool, known by this name at night when torches magically illuminate the pool has poolside bar and wait service, ideal for adults, and features some comfortable canopied day beds. No tto mention the \"Aqua Bar and Grill\" has fanstic burgers. . -The Sandy Beach pool is ideal for families and young children, and features a sandy beach. -The Lagoon. Sitting areas and fire pits make this a perfect and calming space for relaxing with the morning paper, or sitting around a fire with friends at night. . Absolutely perfect in every way!","We've been coming to this location for years and haven't had a bad experience yet. They recently renovated the place and it looks great! The staff are alway courteous and smiling, the pizza is away delish and their baked wings are always perfectly crispy. I tried the Broaster Chicken and it was BOMB! I usually have a hard time deciding what to order. \u203c It's a great neighborhood spot where we always feel welcome. Five out of five.","A friend and I came here for lunch to try their items. We ordered:. Chicago style pizza dip. Bacon and beer nuts. Roast pork sandwich. Sweet Italian beef sandwich. Green chili pork. Poutine. Meeting at noon, the Goose Island Pub was empty save for two other patrons. All sandwiches were shared between us. I also ordered an iced tea which was refilled frequently. . Starting with the bacon and beer nuts and the Chicago style pizza dip, I found the beer nuts nice and spicy with small pieces of bacon mixed in. The beer nuts were quite spicy. The pizza dip is a different way of having pizza without getting a pie. It's served with pieces of garlic crust and you spoon the dip onto the crust with some giardiniera (if you want) and it's quite good. . All three of the sandwiches had good flavors and the breads were soft and good. The green chili pork sandwich was on a kaiser roll and had a fried egg. . Finally, I have to mention the poutine. This is the only place in Las Vegas to get authentic poutine. It was the first time I had tasted real poutine and it was quite good.  . Service was very good. The place was very quiet. I'm not sure if the Hard Rock's clientele were all interested in going to the pools but I sure saw a bunch of scantily clad ladies heading that way. . Chef Bradley Manchester has come up with a limited menu of good sandwiches and snacks. This is a great place for getting a quick sandwich and a beer.","My review is based on late night visits. Decent local pizza joint that has your basic slices (pep, Hawaiian, vegetarian) and then a couple Indian twists: Tandoori slice and Donair Slice (ask for sauce) and both of these are delicious. Always hot and ready slices, whole pizzas are available too. The guy who works here is a nice, he likes to joke around with clientele. Love the graffiti and sticker bombs inside the place (which is standing room only). Great late-night/after bar food, don't expect anything else.","The wait is ridiculous even for being busy. There was an hour before our pizza even went into oven. No pizza is really that worth it. I've had better.","BEST PIZZA EVER . . . and much more!!  Salads are great. Lots of choices for adults and kids. Delicious. Reasonable pricing. Cher T. , General Manager is personable and very attentive to guests making sure EVERYTHING is perfect. Service is exceptional by all staff -- smiling , polite and efficient. Order is ready AND served in a flash. Lots of places to go for pizza -- but fat Cats /  Pizini - Gilbert is the BEST !  Rick &amp; Peggy S.","So most of the reviews we read showed how the Flamingo was a bad hotel. I beg to differ. We got a great rate for room and flight through Vegas. com $236 for a flight and hotel for 2 nights, 3 days. We weren't expecting much for the room, because who stays in there room in Vegas anyways?. POOL: Why we chose the Flamingo, THE POOL! The GO pool is totally worth the stay. There is one major big pool with a waterfall and there is a small pool towards the entrance. The upstairs area pool is for kids and families. There are palm trees in the water and there is a small lagoon area. Dancers come out at around 11 - 12:00 PM noon to dance while trendy tunes are blasting around. They have happy hour specials from 8 to 12 PM. $20 bucket of beer (5) and $5 bloody marys and Coors Light cans. There is a grotto, several drink stands and servers that walk around to take orders of food and drinks. We ordered a chicken quesadilla and chicken tenders and were super happy with the taste and portions. Can't complain here. You are not supposed to bring in food or drink. They will allow coffee and water. Yes, things are a bit expensive in regards to drinking at the pool. Their collective flamingo cup with slushy alcoholic beverage runs about $22. Get there at 8:00 AM when the pool opens, so you can get a good seat, otherwise you won't find one and you will have to lay your towel out by the pool and sit. Cabanas get booked fast. Daybeds are $249. Not sure how much lounge chairs are. Think you can book ahead on the cabanas, possibly online. NEED YOUR ID and ROOM KEY TO get into the pool, so plan ahead! Towels as you walk in. . ROOM: We arrived around 11:00 PM. We asked for an early check in. It would have been $30, which isn't a big deal. But the lady asked us if we wanted an upgrade for $20 and she would wave the early check in rate. SOLD. Our room overlooked Caesar's Palace. The beds had white sheets and covers with a pinkish furry thing at the end of our bed. There were two Flamingo property photographs that were trendy on the walls. The couch was grey with pink trimming and our view was great. We were pleased with what we had. Yes, the bathroom looks a bit dated, but everything was functional and clean. Again, you shouldn't be in your room, so we were happy with the location on the strip and our view. The Flamingo is a great location on the strip. You can easily get to Caesar's and its about a 10-15 min walk to Bellagio and the Paris. About a 20 min walk to Cosmopolitan and Aria. Taxi cab rides to Cosmpolitan or Aria were about $10. Split the costs with your friends and you are saving a lot more money. Amenities like coffee, shampoo/conditioner in one, soap. TV was fine and the AC worked very well. . TIP: If you have a total rewards card, you go into check in a lot quicker. We bypassed 100 guests by going into the Total Rewards line for check in. CHA CHING! If you don't have one, go over to the Total Rewards desk, get your Total rewards card and then go check in. You'll save time. Also, your Total Rewards card will get you discounts here and there on Harrah's properties (Harrahs, Flamingo, the Quad, Caesar's, Ballys etc) . Paradise Buffet: We were planning on going off the strip for lunch, but we were at the Flamingo and saw a buffet. We paid $30 but added on a $9. 99 all you can drink beer, wine, bloody marys, mimosas deal. The buffet was typical with prime rib, shrimp, chicken, pasta, salad, mac and cheese and lots of desserts. I drank my $9. 99 mimosas and beers and had a great buzz going on! So, if you sit there for awhile and drink, you'll get your moneys worth, especially since all the casinos charge so much for drinks. Of course you could sit at a machine or gamble and stock up, but that could get expensive. So remember that many of the Harrah's properties have the $9. 99 all you can drink option for their buffets, expect for Caesar's Bacchanal buffet. . Casino Payoffs: Pretty good. I had luck here. Played Star Wars, played Sex and the City and the Hangover and won money, so I'm a happy camper. . There are Flamingos as the pool, real live ones. Saw a lot of people eating at a pizza bar located by the Paradise buffet. Looked and smelled delicious. A reasonable price to stay at a central location. They have renovated areas and rooms, so give it a try. Again, dont compare it to Bellagio, Encore, Wynn or the new places. If you want to save some money, stay here.","After many drinks in me, I was craving pizza, which is my standard fare of food when under the influence of alcohol. Luckily my friend agreed and we had not gone to Aria yet during our trip, and Yelp directed us here. . Admist the casino and other dining options, located next door to the sports bar area, we were told it would be a 15 minute wait but then called immediately. Score!. We were seated and given drinks shortly after. We saw the table next to us of 3 young boys (10-12) given 3 large pizzas for the 3 of them! We were in shock as they annhilated all 3 pies! they all passed out right after, and it was fun free entertainment. . My friend and I shared their caeser salad, which was really good but glad we asked for the dressing on the side. If you're not a fan of anchovies, avoid this salad as it's really strong. They also provide a side of egg yolk for the dressing as well, but we didn't touch it. . We then asked if we could do a half and half pizza as I'm a white sauce fan, friend is not. The waitress warned us that it would turn pink in the middle and we were okay with that. When I ordered the forager (mushrooms, bacon, spinach) and my friend ordered the margherita, the waitress then told us the whole pink sauce again (within 30 seconds of telling us the first time) and again, we told her it was okay. . Pizza arrived not too long later, and can't go wrong with woodfired pizzas. Mine was slightly burnt around certain parts, but it was super tasty. Hit the spot. My friend's margherita was excellent as well. I couldn't even finish 2 of the 3 slices, so we took it to go and it was a great midnight snack. The pizza was around $26 which was not bad at all. . They also had a huge line for pizza slices to go (and table top seating) which is super smart for people who need a quick bite or craving after drinking.","Not impressed with this place at all!. I've eaten here many times and it gets increasingly disappointing every time. The sushi pizza is more like a flat bread sushi pizza, so it's almost  like fried toffee when you try and chew it. . . . very gross. The gyoza is okay, cooked well and very tasty, but the seaweed salad is horrible. The maki's and hand rolls are never spectacular.   . And you know this would all be forgivable if this place was cheap, but it's pricey for what you're getting. I would pass on this one.","We had Fazio's deliver dinner last week &amp; I can say, that it is as good as any pizza I've eaten from the South Hills.  (If you know who I mean). I ordered a large white pizza w/ mushrooms &amp; extra cheese and a Italian hoagie. Both were fresh &amp; delish!  The extra cheese was not necessary. There was enough leftover for dinner the following Monday.  . The delivery person was very friendly &amp; helpful. This is my new go to pizza place and I live in an area that have plenty choices.","Really warm and friendly staff, delicious margarita pizza! Will definitely go back and excited to try other things on the menu!","Loved the pizza here! I tried the La Parma one because I was craving prosciutto. I was not disappointed! I would definitely eat here again.","Absolutely terrible service. Our server was the most clueless guy. He told us that he didn't recommend the lasagna and the extra thin crust pizza. So I ordered anyways. Pizza was ok. The lasagna tasted like the forest floor. This place is terrible.","My new favorite Wood Fire/Steel pan pizza place in Madison! The atmosphere is cool and eclectic. The basement lounge is comfy cozy and cool in the old Bank Vault. . Back to the food. Best crunchy crispy wood fired crust. To die for. . Cannot wait to go back when the weather allows the doors to be open on all sides. . One small complaint, it took a while to get our first round of drinks, but after that, service was excellent.","We ordered from this location last night for the first time in about 8 years. . We got take out because we were busy and we wanted to take out some place close. We usually go to Little Joe's Pizza as it is our favorite, but it would have been an additional 20 minutes and everyone was hungry now. . On the phone, we ordered the family special. One large pepperoni and a large pineapple pizza with a side of cheesy bread sticks and a 2 liter bottle of Pepsi. One we got home we discovered that their large size pizza was about 14\". Little Joe's pizzas large pizza is 16-18 inches so you can see our disappointment in the size of Pizza Huts pizza. The bread sticks were good. I liked their marinara dipping sauce. I didn't mind eating the pineapple pizza even though it seemed greasy and the crust was light and fluffy. The pepperoni tasted horrible which turned my husband off to ever ordering here again in any situation. . I'm only giving it 2 stars due to the taste of the pepperoni pizza and the small size. For the same amount of money at Little Joe's Pizza I could have fed 2 more people so I don't feel I got the best bang for my buck.","We had a beer at the bar and ordered a pizza to go. It was a very pleasant dining experience, with the hard-working bartender being very attentive but not obnoxious. . The pizza is something special with extraordinarily fresh mozzarella and a tasty sauce that had some texture, but not too much . . . for a person like me that won't eat chunks of tomatoes. . They kept the pizza in the \"crisper\" for a good 25 minutes while we finished our beer and by the time we got back to the hotel it was pretty soggy. Sticking it in the oven mostly brought the crisp back. . From the look of the salads around us, they were generous. I really like this place and would definitely go back. . (Beer and wine only, with a very limited liquor selection)","We will never go to this Sauce again. I ordered a salad and a pizza. We finished the salad and waited and waited for the pizza. I got up and asked the waitress if they forgot the pizza, she laughed and said yes that they forgot and it would be 10 min before we could get it. She never apologized or offered to take some of the price off, nothing. Just rude!!","Absolutely HORRIBLE!! Messed up the order called back to get it fixed and they were RUDE about it. . . Burnt the pizza and refused to replace it cuz a piece of it was missing. . . Ordered a geek salad and was given Italian and Caesar dressing!! Will NOT be ordering from them again!! TERRIBLE","My girlfriend threw a suggestion for lunch out of left field today! . One of her customers came and raved about the pizza at Mangia and Bevi - a very cool looking joint on the east side (right across from the Toronto Sun building) on King Street East . . . and I was excited to try something different. . We had a simple lunch:  I had the Salata Pizza, pretty nice with ricotta, black olives, roasted tomatoes and arugula and my girlfriend had the Giudaica, which was excellent! It had percorino, artichokes, mozzerella and mint. One of the nicest combinations I have tried. We shared both pizzas and unanimously declared the Giudaica the champ!. If they had a wood-burning oven, it would put their pizza over the top!. I also love that they serve hot antipasto with the pizzas!. The wine was basic, but the portions were quite generous for the price. . Good simple quaffing wine. I had a really nice glass of Nero D'Avola for eight bucks!. Service was really nice and the everyone appeared to be very down-to-earth. . I would love to return for dinner sometime . . . and perhaps try one of the pastas or even the funghi nordici salad (saut\u00e9ed mixed mushrooms / arugula x-v oil / aged balsamico / parmigiano). Ciao for now and head out to Mangia sometime soon!","Great customer service ! Everyone was very sweet ! The chicken Parmesan was delicious!!! The garlic knots were great as well! The pizza was huge &amp; perfectly seasoned ! Must check it out !","Have mostly ordered delivery from here and they never disappoint! We usually get our pizza thin crusted/ well done, with pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives. The seasoning is on point and the sauce is perfect for the pizza. Going to the restaurant may be tough due to lack of parking but it is honestly more enjoyable at home with friends.","We ordered on a Wednesday at around 5:30 pm. The order arrived by 6 and was fresh and hot. It was, however, missing the potato wedges which we called the store about. They were redelivered about 45 minutes later. After calling about the wedges (which my daughter really wanted, so she didn't eat), we realized one of the pizzas was missing half the toppings. Decided not to call. The online ordering was good but does not allow for 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. Not really family friendly. . Sorry Pizza 73, not gonna order again.","This place is kind of really awesome. We arrived right when they seemed to get busy for lunch but the place is huge so there is no need to worry about not getting a table. Upon entering, the host gave us a card and explained how the whole restaurant worked. You take your card up to the station you want (they are labeled) and order. From there, they scan your card and give you a little beeper to tell you when your food is ready. There are two bars, one at the front and one at the back where the same card concept applies. I ordered the bruschetta pizza and antipasti plate while the other people in my party ordered pasta carbonara and a chicken panini (can't remember exactly what kind). With your meal, they give you bread and there is oil and balsamic at the table. Overall, food was very good and I loved the atmosphere. The only issue I saw with the whole thing was that people could walk out without paying for their meal. I even asked the woman checking me out how they dealt with that and she didn't have an answer or solution to it yet. Definitely worth trying because it's pretty good Italian food that's fast!","We stayed at the quality inn near the universities and wanted some pizza. Found this place on yelp. Great NY style pizza. Family owned so they want customers to be pleased. You can get a simple garden salad for $3 and a chef salad for $3. 50.","Everybody claims to know great pizza when they taste it. I'm no exception. Born and raised in New York, I've had the opportunity to try some really great pizza. And I've eaten pizza all over the country and even in Italy. . Okay. Now that you know I'm an expert. . . Nello's serves up some really great pizza. I had a \"mini\" size with pepperoni, jalapeno, and anchovies. Perfectly done! Great flavor (although you might wonder how with anchovies). They have got really great pizza sauce as well. . All I had was the pizza, so can't speak to other dishes they offer. But I heard no complaints from those around me, and the food I saw looked attractive and appetizing. Nello's has a very good staff (read attentive, quick, and friendly). I hate to say \"you can't go wrong\". But Nello's seems to be a great choice no matter how you slice it.","You can't beat the pizza, beer, atmosphere or staff; always friendly and fun. I won't eat pizza anywhere else. Radio City is a hidden gem in Vegas!","Peking duck and pizza are two of my favourite foods, so to hear that they were being combined was a dream come true. Levetto was pretty easy to find - just north of Dundas &amp; Spadina. We walked in at around 2pm for a late lunch, and there was only one other table there. Though the space isn't large, the minimalistic interior keeps the restaurant looking spacious. . You can choose between four or six slices of a rectangular pizza. We opted for two smalls of the Peking Duck pizza and Soppressata pizza, which came to just under $20. The Peking Duck pizza is topped with hoisin sauce, scallions, and cucumber, while the soppressata comes with large basil leaves, dried sausage, and rich tomato sauce. Both were so delicious, with very crispy crusts. . The servers were all very nice, and I would love to return to Levetto to feature more of their items!","Tried this place late last night. Got 2 XL Pepperoni Pizzas for $15 even. Pretty good deal, I think! And now we have plenty of leftovers for a few days. . There's not a whole lot of places to sit there, but I think they do mostly pick-ups anyway. Employees were friendly and polite. They had a nice big tv there for people to watch while waiting and they keep the a/c running so it's not hot like you'd think a pizza place would be. . I saw someone eating a Philly Cheese Steak and it looked and smelled delicious. I want to try that next, it's only like $5 with fries. . The pizza was good and greasy, in the right way. It reminded me of the pizza I had the first time I went to New York City, it was a place right off Times Square. Anyway, Sofia's pizza was yummy. It tasted very fresh and just plain yummy. The crust was good and thin but not crispy and the sauce tasted like actual fresh tomatoes. Pepperoni was. . . pepperoni. lol. I'm sorry, nothing out of the ordinary there. . Our dog really, really liked the pizza. It was pretty ridiculous the way she whined until we gave her some. Usually she doesn't make a peep. . So there's that.","The cobra team really enjoyed the stay. We had a three bedroom suite (could of been a 4 bedroom but the hotel couldn't find one available so two of our team had to be on a different floor. ) Ours was a two bedroom suite with a additional attached room. Perfect for the team. We had a great gathering spot, with a central kitchen area , which a amazing place to pregame and snack. They had a projection for TV in the living room. Plus a pull out couch. A con is that they took out the ovens *we bought pizzas to bake* which was a recent reduction due to a few headaches the hotel had with drunk cooking. . . The beds where conformable and the team really felt refresh, even the soldiers who slept on the pull out quite enjoyed it. Bathrooms were spacious and clean. . Just like jon p. Like didn't care for lack of poolside service. But understanding this wasn't a party hotel, really can't be too negative there. Pool were a good size and was very sunny which is a plus considering so many others are dwarfed by other hotels. . Overall this place is a great choice for large teams. Such as the Commanders Crew of 10. I would come here again for that reason.","Left me upset enough to create a yelp account. customer service is just important to me as food. I can't really comment on the food but I wanted to share my experience using their delivery service. I found this place here on yelp. Looking forward to finding a new place for pizza. I place my order online. I was called within minutes to confirm the order, they told me it was going to be an hour. I said no problem and waited. . after an hour nobody showed up. . I called to get a status. They simply said sorry its already out for delivery. Thinking it may show up any minute I waited. . . . another 30 mins later still nothing. Im only a mile away. Called again same ol story they gave me an insincere apology, which is why I didn't want to wait any longer. Im starving and can't leave because they are still on the way. . . maybe?? With making no effort to earn a new customer just seem they rather get me off the phone to take more orders. Having to repeatedly call with no kinda real info or eta when ill ever get my food. I canceled my order and went to find somewhere else to eat. Which defeated the reason why I wanted delivery. If I had knew it would be this frustrating or this long I wouldn't have ordered. They are quick to charge my card but getting food another story. Im sure they have wonderful food but ill never know. They have left a bad taste in my mouth. So if you give them a chance don't make it for delivery.","I ordered one small pizza and one medium pizza directly off their menu with no special additions. That is not what was delivered to my door. This was late on a monday night too. Not like some busy weekend rush or dinner hour to get in the way.  . The real frustration came in trying to fix the order. After calling the place three times, I was put on hold, hung up on, unable to talk to the same person twice, major communication issues, and not once offered an apology or way to fix this. They really need to work on the customer service. Over two hours later I was left with two small pizzas totaling $ 35. . While I can't vouch for the actual taste of the pizza since I ended up with plain cheese, the service sucks. This place just lost my business. Not worth the hassle. I wish the best of luck to the rest of you!","I just love this place. And have I told you how much I love their eggplant parmesan?! I truly appreciate that they leave it unbreaded, so you can truly enjoy the flavor without all the over abundance of breading. Monday is half price pizza night, yum!! And this is what keeps me coming back time after time after time.","I used to like their pizzas, but twice already I couldn't get in! First time, I get a rude employee saying that we aren't open! And tonight I rang the doorbell twice and I was ignored!. And another thing. . . why did you stop serving bacon on pizzas?","My parents came to visit, and I needed somewhere to take them that would please everyone. I am really glad we chose here. They were both extremely happy with their pizza. I ordered the truffle pizza, which was delicious. I will say that it did not taste very strongly of truffles - in fact I can't even remember tasting them at all, which considering it was the most expensive pizza it was slightly disappointing. My partner ordered a pizza with pesto, and he wasn't a huge fan of the pesto which I believe is almond based, making it slightly sweet. I do wish that there were more non-pork options - be it either vegetarian or not. Overall, satisfying and fairly quality ingredients, just needs a little fine-tuning to make everything shine.","Desperately craving pizza, but not of the Pizza Pizza variety, I headed to Pizza Rustica for the first time on the recommendation of a friend who had walked by it many times, never been, but ensured me it always smelt \"very, very good\". . We arrived at about 7:30 on a Friday night, and I was surprised at how very small this place is. There are about 10 - 15 tables and a bar area, and unfortunately we got there just as the last table was snapped up. Luckily there were 2 spots left at the bar, and we were able to get a drink while we waited. A nice surprise occured when our would-be waitress approached us and asked if we'd like to order before we got our table, as the food would arrive as soon as we were seated. Nice one. My stomach at this point was practically jumping out of my throat, so speed was key. . Once seated (about a 20 minute wait at the bar), our food arrived approximately 5 minutes later. I ordered the Tre Carne pizza, with a ton o' meat and banana peppers, onions and tomatoes. The ground beef was fantastic, really flavourful. The pizza itself had a nice thin crust and a thin but balanced layer of sauce and cheese. I personally am not a fan of thick crust or too much sauce - less is more, so this suit me perfectly. . All in all my pizza craving was asauged, and the leftovers (and unless you are ready to eat a small horse, there will be leftovers) tasted even better warmed and with a little hot sauce the next day. The place itself is a little small, so if there are no bar seats I'd move along, as the wait isn't worth it if you're standing around for 20 minutes.","A friend once told me a pizza stone is the secret behind great pizza bread. im going to bet they use a stone here. Bread tasted flawless and i came in on a full stomach. ok i've only tried this one pizza here called Terra (Roasted potatoes, sweet pancetta, red onions, mozzarrella, with spinach) but im going ahead and say that this place is in my top 3 pizza joints in Toronto. great value pizza and friendly service, usually lots of parking on the street. only thing i should point out is its shallow wine list. i think a solid pizza place should have a deep wine selection","8. 50 with tax for a one topping pizza, and $4 for a pitcher before 6pm (and $6 after). The $4 pitcher can even be Yuengling or Blue Moon. Makes for a cheap dinner with friends. . The pizza is greasy but surprisingly tasty. It's a bit smokey (I can't wait until PA is no smoking in bars like Maine and California). . Dollar drinks Friday night attract quite a few students.","Food is usually up to par. My only gripe is wait times. Hot n ready means. . . . hot and ready. Theyve told me if i need more than 2 pizzas to call ahead. Which isnt often. . . i needed 3 once and had a wait. So not bad. If pizza is ready tho, breadsticks arent. I usually order 2 $6 xtra most bestest and 2 breadsticks. I always end up waiting. At least 10-20 min. Very rare i walk in and right back out. Hitting it before 5pm helps. I havent had any complaints about their food from the fam. Huge plus. Pretty consisent. I miss their cheesy bites. Those were awesome. This location doesnt have a high turn around either. Alot of the employees ive seen for quite some time and are pleasant. If it werent for high wait time, this would be 5 star.","We got our first takeout tonight. Pizza for my husband and grilled chicken club salad for me.   . First - the food was ready to go in 15 min - had to leave right after ordering. I was a bit worried that this would mean it was not fresh. WRONG.   Salad was huge - and very fresh. The chicken was even warm. The pizza was terrific as well.  . Cannot comment on how it is to dine in but we will be trying it out!","We ordered after EDC last night, we got home and were starving and found their menu slipped under the door of our hotel room, it took over an hour to arrive, then when it got here it was 1 pizza short and we had 1 extra two-liter bottle of Pepsi. . When we had ordered, the woman on the phone when we ordered, repeated our order back to us and it did include only 1 Pepsi and 3 pizzas instead of the two we got. . I told the delivery guy we didn't order two bottles and he just gave me attitude and said: \"It's what the receipt says, it's just $3 more\". . I didn't care that it was just $3 more, my point was we did not want two Pepsi's. . Then when we called to complain the woman on the other end of the line also had a shitty attitude saying it wasn't their fault that they took the order wrong and that they're just human, mistakes happen. . They told us we could get the pizza we were missing but we would have to return the extra Pepsi and pay the remainder of the cost of the pizza plus it would take another hour to arrive. . Worst service and attitude ever.","Crush vaulted to one of our favorite Vegas restaurants, especially on the strip. Had the ricotta gnocchi with braised beef, and my fianc\u00e9 had the date, artichoke, and jalape\u00f1o pizza. Both were outstanding. French onion soup was solid as well.","Just got back! This is the third time in a row that pizza was burnt. Not only mine but several others as well. Also the Garlic Knots burnt. Such a shame. I do not think I will be going back to this place now. How one cannot tell when something is burnt is beyond me. Again this was the third time in a row. Heck, even the other person sitting at another table said their fries were burnt as well. . . OPEN YOUR EYES before you have no more locals coming!!!","I always visit Five50 when I'm in Vegas. It's tucked into Aria, towards the Sports Book. It's not a huge place but it's a hidden gem in my mind. The pizza is some of the best I've had. If you're in the mood for pizza on the strip, Five50 is must to check out.","Okay so if you want great pizza on south side go here. Not a disappointment. Slices are huge! It's BYOB. Low key spot and great pizza. Service was great too, very nice. Also a good place when you leave the bars at 2am and want a slice to take home.","My first visit here and i was going to use the groupon i bought, but they had a special of half off any pizza so i decided to try that and save the groupon for another time. I can say my daughter and i enjoyed the pizza, far from the usual papa johns or pizza hut. she usually doesnt like thin crust but loved it. and while my only complaint is that the end of the pizza was a lil soggy but that was due to the fresh vegetables. Overall it was good enough for me to try again.","Our favorite close to home spot! Foods always good, wing night in Wednesday's is our favorite! But the pizza is delicious as well!","I like to try different pizza places . . having worked at pizza shops for a few years I have a pretty good gauge on decent pizza. I can tell you this pizza was very good , solid ingredients and the dough was excellent, obviously made fresh which is very important . Keep up the good work .","Fresh and simple food. Best pizza I have had in 4 months. Staff is really friends and cares about quality. Nothing trendy here. Just a great product served by great people.","Oh so good. My husband loves the panzerotti and I love a simple pepperoni pizza. Such good taste and a nice change from the typical chains. Great little hidden gem in Ajax!","I'm new to the city and am so glad that I found my go to pizza place already!! So far I've tried their Hawaiin pizza and Buffalo bbq pizza, both with turbo crust and they are just awesome!! They do delivery and catering as well. Once I did delivery and they were really quick.","Update: The manager sent us a gift card to try out Giodano's again. Completely different experience tonight. The food and service were much better. The waiter wrote down our orders and they were mostly right. One pizza was missing jalapenos on half and the other pizza had mushrooms which were not requested. Either way, they tasted great. The cheese was melted and the crust was not soggy. The wait was not as bad as last time either (they were not as busy). The waiter checked on us regularly and refilled drinks when needed. After tonight's experience, I would be open to coming back. . Hint for leftovers: Use a small amount of oil in a non-stick skillet and fry them for 2-3 minutes prior to putting them in the oven, it keeps the crust from getting hard and chewy!","Great service and super balls! We had apes pepperoni pizza, veal sandwich and rice balls. Everything was amazing, topped off with great personal touch.","So I'm pretty much an old lady. Although, I do like to pretend that I know what's hip and occasionally douche it up with the young'ns. But, this wasn't one of those times. I took the family to Vegas for a weekend getaway and South Point offered the best value. Yeah it's off the strip but it's fine if you drive here because you could just take the 5 minute drive in if you choose to. This hotel is beautiful inside and out. It doesn't feel all used and abused. It's very family friendly. They have a bowling alley, a movie theater, an equestrian center, an arcade, and all the other things you'd expect from a Vegas hotel; the casino, a spa, fitness center, barber shop, and pools. There's the main pool, a kiddie pool, and a jacuzzi. There is a daily fee for the fitness center, though, wack. . . The room was nice and clean, 500 sq. ft. , the bathroom was big and had a door separating the bathtub from the vanity, which is awesome, right? I also had a view of the pool. . The main floor has something like 9 restaurants, a few of which I did eat at. Also, the bowling alley has a snack bar that serves pizza, hot dogs, nachos, that type of thing. . There was something wrong with the elevators while I was here, not sure if it happens all the time, but, there were only two of the six elevators working; kind of inconvenient. . Overall, I had a great time. It was nice to get away and relax like a grown up. . side note: I won my first night there and then lost it on the second night. . My review and/or star rating was not affected by this experience.","What a freak show. Waited for a pizza order and watched the counter guy getting his neck and cheeks rubbed by another guy who was wearing a grey coat and was obviously not working there at the time. Another employee start laughing and a fight broke out behind the counter. They carried the guy in the grey coat out the door and he was swearing up a storm. The guy he punched eventually waited on me. I don't know who owns this place but they need to know what happened and what a bunch of misfits are working there. Great food. Creepy employees. Keep the recipe, get new help. Others witnessed this crap. Happened on Thursday around 7:30 pm. Never again.","I've eaten enough frozen dinners to know that their alfredo dinner is just a frozen dinner meal reheated. Same noodles, sauce, and chicken. Same with their jalape\u00f1o poppers. Stick to the pizza here, it's decent.","On a Thursday night in August, my husband and I happened upon this three-week-old restaurant south-west of Vieux-Montreal. The small restaurant seats 20 or so comfortably with additional seating at the bar. The place was a buzz with activity. We did not have reservations and the hostess hesitated before giving us a table. . Rustic wood floors and brick walls made Jane feel warm and welcoming. The menu, as in many restaurants in Montreal, was written in chalk on a large black board. The food was fresh and seasonal. The main courses were mainly pizzas with one Fish option. . We shared a warm Asparagus salad with duck shavings and mushrooms. All was drizzled with a pleasantly tart vinagrette. . I had the Schwartz pizza of smoked meat and cheeses. (See the Famous Schwartz Deli site). There was cheese in the perfectly baked crust. It was nice and thin under the toppings, but full enough around the edges that I could really enjoy the bread! . My husband had the cod special - seared cod served on a bed of mushrooms and asparagus in a seafood stock. . The staff were friendly and the service was very good - I could tell these people knew what they were doing. . A great little place!","Love this place! Our family really enjoys the patio! Great bruschetta, salad &amp; pizza!","Liz J. and I visited Caliente's for the first time about a month ago. We were super hungry and wanted to try everything on the menu!. We ordered the loaded fries and breaded zucchini to start. They were both delicious! Although they were amazing, they weren't anything out of the ordinary when it comes to bar appetizers. . Next, we ordered the buffalo chicken rolls and the jalapeno bacon rolls. I assumed we would be receiving two small orders, since they were only $7 each and I became adjusted to receiving small portions of rolls at restaurants. . No. There were six rolls in each order and they were HUGE. I was only able to finish one of each and I was completely stuffed. They were homemade and absolutely amazing. The flavors were awesome and they went deliciously with their homemade ranch. . I was pleasantly surprised with my visit to Caliente's. I assumed it was going to be just another pizza bar, but it wasn't at all. Awesome service, a great selection of drafts and OUT of this WORLD rolls! I also ordered pepperoni rolls to go and gave them to my cousin- she loved them too!","The food here is amazing! If you can find it. This place was a little hard to find if you have never been here before. The sign is not where the restaurant is. We almost went home because we thought they had gone out of business or something. As we were heading back toward the freeway we thought we would just swing around back and there is was hiding behind some giant trees. I am so happy we found it. I got the regular burger and fries and it was super yummy and fresh. I also got the dark chocolate milk shake and it was out of this world!!! Even the cherry on top looked like they had marinated it themselves. My husband got the special, which was some kind of fried pork chop sandwich. My daughter got the pizza, which I tried and it was delish. If you have time take a stroll over to the community garden and look at the plots. Or hope in your car and drive through the darling neighborhood that surrounds the restaurant.","Being from Chicago, I love trying local Pizza companies that serve Chicago Style Pizza. Oregano's recently opened another restaurant on Bell Road in Glendale and I could not be happier. I went in for the first time a couple days ago, and the staff was extremely nice. I ordered a Pan Pizza to go and it was fantastic. My dad heated up the leftovers the next day and said it was the \"best next day heated up pizza\" he ever ate. Love it!!!","We have been going to RWB since it opened, about 14 years ago. My husband says they have the best pizza and that is what we usually order but everything I have ever had there great. We had introduced many friends to their eatery and all love it. In the winter time the winter visitors usually have it really crowded from late afternoon to well after dinner time.","This is a local restaurants it's always very busy the staff and the owners are wonderful it's been in the neighborhood for about 20 years staff is always very attentive portions are large food is delicious the garlic Parmesan rolls are delicious we love everything that we get here normally on Fridays after 430 usually have a wait there's open seating in the bar tables are small but you can make them do if you're in a hurry they serve lots of fish dinner is here but the restaurant never smells like fish every single time we come we have a great time I would highly recommend this restaurant you can call ahead and pick up a delicious pizza if you don't have time to cook for dinner they also make a ton of salads The pizza roll is huge feeds three people easily my favorite is the meatball chicken wings outstanding taste like they were delivered from Buffalo New York  it's nice to have such a great restaurant in the neighborhood highly recommended","Definitely a nice space. Open. Well appointed. Tried it for lunch. Two of sat at bar. Crowded but we got there at 12:30 after the rush. . Bartender brought us water but did not take a drink order. When we finally got her attention we asked about the food since it is a complicated menu. They seem to be excited about their pizza but have their own lexicon and she did a poor job of explaining, but in her defense there is a lot to explain and it was busy. Manager standing around watching instead of helping. Back to reading menu. Decided to just get the pizza special. . Beer came. Very short pour. When I questioned I was told it was a higher alcohol beer so, like many places, it was an eight ounce poor in a snifter. Ok. But I poured out water glass and poured in beer and at best it was a six ounce poor. At best. Additionally, they are charging $8  for that small pour for a mid-range local craft beer. . Then we were told the kitchen was backed up and the wait would be at least 30 minutes. Time to leave. . Bartender talked to the manager and came back and offered some cheese curds but we were already heading out. Paid for the drinks snd left. . Bartender at least tried, earning the two stars and maybe a trip back. . Nice, but seems pretentious, over priced and under managed.","Completely awful. Ordered a pizza and it took 1 hour and 15 minutes and the place was only 1/4 busy and they got it wrong TWICE.  We didn't realize the 2nd screw up until we got home. We assumed after the 1st screw up and apology they'd get it right. The bartenders were dancing like they wanted to have fun but paid zero attention to our order. WILL NEVER GO BACK.","Order came cold and incorrect. Ordered off Grubhub. No fault with Grubhub. Won't order pizza from this restaurant again.","The double-decker Chicago-style pizza is a winner!  The sauce is fabulous and it's cooked beautifully. Well done!","I had been wanting to try this place since it opened because I enjoy Greek food. I was happy to finally try it with a friend courtesy of Groupon. The menu has some great choices. But it's definitely on the more expensive side. My friend ordered the Greek Pasta and really enjoyed it. I had the Lemon Chicken with Greek Fries. The fries were terrific. The chicken was tasty, but given than it was a half chicken I thought it was a little on the petite side. I ordered a piece of espresso cake to go. It was good but when I went to eat it later that night it seemed to be missing most of the bottom layer which was disappointing after I had to wait ten minutes for it to be boxed up. . I've since returned with the same friend (this time with a Pittsburgh Dining Card). We decided to get the Greek fries as an appetizer since we both liked them so much last time along with the spanikopita. For our entrees, my friend got the tapenade pizza and I selected the lamb kabobs. I'm not usually a fan of olives, but that pizza was quite tasty. My lamb kabobs were exactly what I wanted, sitting gently on rice pilaf. For dessert we both decided on the warm comfort of the milopita.  . All in all I dig it. The prices are a little on the high side so having a Groupon or a similar discount helps. Combine that with good food and good service, I'm sure to return again with my Mediterranean food loving friend once our pockets can handle it.","Small little pastry shop which has many sinful dessert items and some delicious looking pizza. Our stop here was for my daughter and she enjoyed a very nice cone of ice cream on a warm spring day. They had a very nice relaxing terrace (outdoor patio area) where we relaxed while my daughter enjoyed a nice requested smaller ice cream cone. . Inside the shop is small and there is a nice selection of prepared pizza plus lots of very decadent desserts and French (from France desserts and eclairs). If you ate here regularly you may have to loosen the notch on your belt by one or two. A nice addition to the neighbourhood and the shops owners were gracious in acknowledging us and were pleasant. . A great place to come if you are having company and need some quick desserts or if sweet food is your calling in life!","I really appreciate Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza. After all, the pizza is simply good. The crust is thin and perfect and the bites are elegantly simple. Some of the specialty pizzas are conceived somewhat strangely. For instance, the arugula pizza just comes with arugula piled on top and dusted with some parmesan, so it's really an arugala salad atop a piece of excellent cheese pizza. While this might be peculiar, it certainly doesn't invoke a complaint. The wings are roasted and they are very good, although not necessarily what one might expect.","Friendly staff, the pizza and salads are full of flavor and you can tell they use a lot of fresh ingredients. Can't wait to come back!","I would like to give it no stars. The pizza was burnt. We ordered a cheese plate, and the only thing they got right was the olives (which is standard). I had to ask for the flatbread that came with it. We ordered one cheese and two meats. . . I got two cheeses and one meat and it wasn't even the meat that we ordered. My cloth napkin had holes in it. But the bartender is flirting with my boyfriend to make it right. . . This place sucks.","I call and the order is normally ready in 20 minutes. Normally, I order a large Barrows special thin crust and it is a great pizza. . . Sometimes my wife and I will eat at Barro's and we will have a pitcher of beer. The service and quality are normally excellent. . .","Make sure you zero out the  tip area on your credit card slip when Papa Johns delivers ( used to be camfield corners now relocated to Johnston rd. . )  . . . . 2 times now. . . someone between HERE &amp; THERE added a tip to my debit card  purchase after getting a CASH tip too. . . . I finally think hubby learned a lesson. . . !!!  Papa Johns offered us a couple free pizzas to rectify the situation. . . . ummmm NO. . . . . a 5 year customer has been LOST . . . . and Hungry Howies has gained a NEW customer !","My new favorite place. Just got home from our third visit to Humble Wine Bar in Lakewwood. Very comfortable place, we actually like sitting at the bar where you can watch the food being prepared. We've had the chicken pesto pizza, the shrimp pizza and the lardo pizza. All three were excellent, but the lardo is just heavenly. If your looking for pizza that tastes like bread with a ton of pizza sauce, this isn't the place for you. Humble's pizza's are thin crust and the toppings and cheese do all the talking. Really outstanding. Great selection of wines. Try the roasted artichokes, they are amazing. Love the location and the nice big windows. Excellent happy hour too.","I'm baffled by the negative reviews talking about price and pretension on here. . . this is why we can't have nice things. . I had a relaxing and truly delicious lunch here this past week. I'm a fan of Jonathon Sawyer so I was excited. My mom and I walked in and were seated immediately. The restaurant itself is beautiful and quaint. It's quite an intimate space but not claustrophobic, very elegant but not pretentious at all. . Service was above and beyond. Our server was friendly, helpful and perfectly attentive. Reading some other reviews made me a bit intimidated at first because I was wearing workout leggings and others claimed they were dressed nicely and ignored by staff. Apparently this must've been a one-time thing because I felt welcomed and no one but me cared about what I was wearing. . We ordered the golden beet salad, carrots &amp; parsnips and the mushroom pizza. We ended the meal with the buttermilk custard. The standout was definitely the carrots &amp; parsnips. They're tender, sweet with a little savory bite, very well done. The beet salad was great as well. It's a bit smoky though so if that isn't your thing this isn't your thing. I disagree with other reviewers on the mushroom pizza. I thought it was delicious, specifically because of the kale. It cuts the creaminess of the fonduta and the result is an awesome umami flavor that isn't too heavy. The buttermilk custard was actually the only thing I didn't love, it's good, but nothing to rave about. . I expected the portions to be small and I found our three dishes to be more than enough food for two people. We even had leftovers. It's a nice restaurant -- don't expect the portions to be the same as the Cheesecake Factory. I think the same goes for price. I was actually expecting our bill to be much, much higher. With two starters, one pizza, one dessert and two coffees - our bill only came out to $46. Perhaps I'm just used to LA prices where something like this would've easily been closer to $80. . tl;dr - If you want a well thought out meal for a decent price, try Trentina. And stop complaining about portion sizes.","Two words: buffalo mozzarella. Somehow, this simple tasting white blob of a cheese makes a world of difference to a pizza. I was really, really wishing there was more of it  on mine, which was the \"Prosciutto\", consisting of the said cured meat, rocket and sweet cherry tomatoes. I finished the whole pie with ease, which is testament to how good it was, as well as how thin albeit authentic, according to my date who knows a thing or two about Napolitan pizzas) the crust was. He had the marinara, with extras of egg and anchovies, which was quite good too. It was a Sunday afternoon when I dined there and I was not in a hurry to get anywhere after, so the length of time it took for the food to arrive didn't bother me much. However, I was slightly disappointed that the pizza didn't arrive piping hot. The outer crust was lukewarm, hinting that there had been a slightly more than desirable delay in it being delivered to our table. Overall though, it was a very pleasant outing. We sat on the terrace, the servers were lovely and the price reasonable. It's a great asset to the neighbourhood.","First off, know that this place is really more for take-out and delivery. The couple tables seem more for waiting. . . it's really small and not particularly decorated. But I ate here, as it was convenient. . I ordered 12 hot wings (can't get a smaller order) and 6 fried mozzarella sticks. They give everyone their order like it's to-go, so mine came in boxes in a bag. The wings were nice and hot. . . waited for them to cool down. The fried mozzarella were good in that the cheese was nice and hot and gooey. . . something I could thoroughly enjoy as I ate them there. However, the breading wasn't very tasty, and they seemed too perfectly similar to have been made there. The marinara served with them was quite good, which would bode well for their pizzas. . The wings were flavored like Frank's Hot Sauce, with plenty of sauce. Nice and hot in temperature, with enough meat on them, these were delish. Most places fry their wings. I couldn't tell for sure, as the skin had a slight crispiness, but didn't taste fried. But I found out that they were.  . So, basically, I was impressed and will return to try their (takeout) pizza!","Nice people. Very friendly. Provided some free garlic sticks while I waited for my pizza. I took advantage of some website coupon deal to get a large pepperoni pizza for around $10 (dine in only). While the pizza was worth $10, I would've felt a little ripped off had I paid the normal price (closer to $18 I believe). The dough is very good (which is supposedly what they are known for), but the sauce, cheese and pepperoni toppings -- I found them all to be similar to what you would get from a made fresh  pizza you get at a grocery store or one of the wholesale club places. While there is no such thing as bad pizza, there is pizza that is just \"so-so\" such that I don't really have any desire to go back and order it again on a regular basis. Such is the case here.","I have eaten here regularly over the last year or so, Just started yelping so it's time to give them a review. . The time a day you go to this place really governs the quality and the freshness of the food in my opinion. I notice that when i go during the lunch hours, the food always seems the freshest. Krazy Buffet is a pretty good place to eat at , during my experience there today and on other occasions , I have noticed that  the staff there really  seem to be concerned with the comfort level of the customer- Making sure your drinks are full- Making sure the food is good- asking if the temperatures OK-- But not overly did or annoying - really more so in the sense of being observant-  I appreciate that kinda stuff. . They have a large selection of Chinese and Japanese food to pick from. Ranging from sushi , noodles , sea foods  , fried rices, vegetables, coca-nut flavored chicken, soups, desserts -ect- - They also have a small selection of typical American likes--- like pizza , french fries , ice cream , salads- ect. . The price seems to very as expected depending on what time of day you go. The same goes for the food. During the day the typical price is about 10 bucks and at night time depending on what kind of foods you desire- like crab legs for instance-- the price could reach up to 13 bucks-- But hey it's all you can eat. . Any way I'm going to give them an overall star score of 4, because the food and the service have  been pretty consistent during every visit I have had, and for me that matters the most. -- Consistency. . Hope this was useful to some one . ENJOY. !","Ordered 2 larges. One all dressed one plain. Received pepperoni instead of plain with giant air pockets. When called back after 10 attempts because their phone lines were busy, I was told that it was a mistake. Yes I agree sending me the wrong pizza is a mistake but the cook placing a pizza with giant air pockets in it which is also 2 inches in diameter smaller than the large ordered in the box isn't a mistake, it was intentional. I have posted the picture. Replacement pizza arrived 2 hours after my initial order with crust just as bas and ice cold. Thank, never will we order here again.","This is good drunk food haha They are usually open till pretty late and sometimes if you are lucky, they will give you the rest of the pizza, and you don't need to pay more for what you originally ordered for - this actually happened to me and my starved biker friend really appreciated it!","The prices are superb and obviously thought out to please students. . The pizza is the best I've ever had in my whole life hands down and absolutely no competition. It was just SUPERB. Three choice of FREE toppings of which I always choose Parmesan. . THIS IS NOT A PLACE TO SIT AT. It's literally a hole in the wall take-out pizza place. Cash only, it takes mere minutes to prepare and it is almost always fresh out of the oven. Beverages are cheap if combined with the slices of Pizza. . An absolute must if you're walking by and hungry. . Careful, you might need to wait outside if there are too many people in the waiting line. (Yes that's how small that place is. )","Went here at 11:30 on a Tuesday, most of their menu was not available. They said they had no toppings except cheese and pepperoni. The woman at the counter was not apologetic or anything. How can you advertise as a top Vegas pizza place and only have two types of pizza a half hour after opening?. I'm vegan and we came here just for the pizza. Not to pay for parking, walk all the way in and just get turned away. Unacceptable. . We asked if they'd have vegan pizza soon and they said \"maybe by dinner time. \". Deserving of zero stars really.","Hard to access with new LRT construction, old tv's in restaraunt area, not many booths. But food was good, what you would expect from any boston pizza.","Great pizza's, with a lot of toppings and nice crispy crust. I had a meat pizza and it had a good variety of meats on it, and they didn't skimp on the amount. . My wife had the cheese pizza with additional toppings. . I usually always finish my pizza but was I glad I didn't as it was excellent cold the next day. . Our waitress was awesome, young and always smiled","Amazing food and great service. I loved the environment. They make their own pasta too. It was yummy. Also I recommend getting dessert and a cappuccino. Delish . This is a great place for a date night or parties. I saw families but it's a romantic place for a date night. My husband and I went there alone and really enjoyed ourselves. Their wine list is crazy amazing. Even people form the city recommended them because they were the only ones to carry certain bottles of brands we wanted. Also they make their own pizzas in a fire brick oven   Try the pesto pizza.","If you like NY style pizza, this place is awesome. You really have to know it's there though. There's usually a small sidewalk sign in front of the building - it's the same building on Tryon that has the Bojangles. Go inside and it opens up into a larger space with more shops. . It's all about the pizza for me. I've been craving old school NY style pizza for a long time. My first bite and that empty hole inside me was satisfied. I'll definitely be coming back for more.","We're a group of healthcare professionals (NPs, PAs, and MDs) that meet every month to catch up and decompress from our crazy jobs; there's about 8 of us. We arrived a bit early yesterday for happy hour, only to find that happy hour was cancelled due to the Rush concert at US Airways. Who cancels a published happy hour? So clearly, they just wanted to make more money off of the concertgoers with no regard to the typical customer. We ordered drinks for the lot, only to be asked every 20 seconds to get out of the way of the serving staff because the place was so packed and there was barely even standing room. There was no way to not be in the way. We got seated on the patio (because an inside table was a 2-hour wait) pretty quickly. However, the misters were broken at the table we were seated at - they worked fine at all of the other patio tables, but not ours. There didn't seem to be any regard for the fact that it was 107\u00b0. We asked to be reseated, they said they couldn't accommodate us anywhere else. We asked about a group of 2-tops that were available, were told they were reserved. I offered to sit at the table with the broken misters until something else opened up, but they said they didn't know how long it'd be before another table opened up. We were pretty much ready to leave (I had said we'd just pick up some wine and go back to my place to make pizzas) when the \"reserved\" 2-tops suddenly became available and were rearranged to accommodate us. The server acted like we were a complete bother to him, like he'd rather be somewhere else with a different group of people. Really didn't engage us very much. The appetizers were fantastic (shrimp and pretzels) and were gone in a heartbeat. Three of the eight of us ordered the prime rib. I joked that I didn't even want mine cooked (i. e. , as rare as possible), and the server told me it was already cooked and my request was not possible. I was kidding, of course, but it wasn't received very well. When our food came, only one of us was given horseradish to accompany our prime rib. When I asked for horseradish for the other two, the server said, \"oh, you want more?\" No, I want SOME. I would say my prime rib was medium-rare at best. It was OK, pretty fatty, but that's a risk you take with prime rib, I suppose. I was going to order another glass of wine, but I couldn't get the attention of the server and he didn't come back to the table to check up on us very frequently. When he brought me a to-go box, I had asked for more au jus and horseradish to-go, so he brought me an empty container to put my remnants in instead of fulfilling my request of new. We usually meet at 6:00 and don't leave until about 9 or 10, usually sit around and have a few drinks while we chat. But this time, we all left by 8 and all went our separate ways. The consensus among the group was that we wouldn't be back, individually or as a whole. . I've been here before and enjoyed myself, but I really won't be back after yesterday's experience. . UPDATE 9/7/2015: Chelsea, manager, messaged me for my phone number to talk about my experience. I sent it to her. Haven't heard a word back. Moot point, really, as it doesn't change my opinion about the place for better or worse. Just solidifies it.","This place is owned by a friend of a friend so I want to see them succeed and I hope this is taken as constructive criticism. That said, I'm torn. I's a great price for a giant pizza but it lacks flavor and they only deliver to the other side of a postage stamp.  . The Good:  Huge pizza for a decent price. . . . The Bad:  I want to love it but it lacks flavor. I think the sauce could use more olive oil, garlic, basil and a pinch of salt to bring it out. The crust is a wonderful texture but again, not much flavor. The pie could benefit from a little pecorino or parmesan in the cheese mix too.  . The Ugly:  if you want it delivered, you better live across the street because that's the boundary!  We live less than two miles and we're told we are outside of their delivery area. . . Hmmmmmm.  . I hope they'll tweak a few things so I can love this place and give it five stars!","4 1/2 stars. Arrived for dinner during the week even though it's a bit of a drive from the strip. Parking was no issue since they are located in a large strip center. . I'm not an regular diner of Lebanese food cuisine but the selection of choices was extensive and they bake their own pita bread in what looked similar to a wood burning pizza oven. The friendly waitress mentioned this is a new location and the interior is decorated tastefully and clean. . I ordered the grass fed lamb tenderloin kabob which included a house salad, pita and I added a cup of yummy lentil soup. The kabob contained bell peppers, tomato, mushrooms and was served over a bed of rice. I ended my meal with the suggested dessert of Shabiet  - which was delightful. . Overall, quality and value here was solid and I would definitely return here if in the area again.","Super fun spot to bring the family. Stopped in for a quick bite after check in and was not expecting much from a pizza place but we were all pleasantly surprised. Maybe it was vacation euphoria but I thought this was a great spot. Our server was funny and great plus only appeared when we needed him. . I loved the Strawberry Lime Cider over ice, kids both had huge shakes that could feed 2, calamari, risotto balls, and the Gotham pizza. . They also have happy hour specials and pizza by the slice up front. Plus if your staying at Aria you can call to get take out. . . Perfect for the older kids in the room with a movie while the parents sin in Vegas","Best pizza I've had in charlotte ! Good customer service and the hidden valley ranch they make is off tha chain!","The best pizza in Toronto hands down!. Reminds me of eating pizza in Italy!. Also a great variety of white pizzas for those that aren't into tomato sauce. . Great place great service.","UPDATE:  I revisited the place today because I thought I'd give them a second chance, after all they are just opening. . Their problem is that they haven't figured out how to do a wood-fired, thin-crust pizza. While the toppings are very good, their pizza is greatly diminished because their crust isn't right. Great wood-fired crust should be a bit crisp on the bottom--but NOT burnt. Theirs is soggy. I first went in during the evening. This time I went in at lunch time. There was a manager there this time who came by and asked how things were. I told her that the pizza wasn't great because the crust was soggy and tough. She indicated that they weren't baking it long enough and would work with the cooks.  . IMHO, the difference between just average pizza and great pizza is in the crust. It's easy to use fresh ingredients, not so easy to make a great crust. This is where they are falling down. Hopefully time will tell if they get this one right, but for the cost ($15+) for a 6-slize pizza and a drink with a sub-par crust is too much to pay. . =====================================================================. It is obvious that the owners put a lot of money and effort into this place. It is very nice inside. The seating is comfortable and well decorated. . However, decor alone does not a restaurant make. When I first walked in I sensed a problem because the place smelled like burned popcorn. I dismissed that and I ordered a pepperoni, kalamata and mushroom pizza. Pretty standard. Their first attempt came out with the crust totally cremated. It was scorched on the top and incinerated on the bottom, yet the center was still raw. I took it back and asked for a re-do. The second attempt came out a little better, but the crust was just doughy, floppy as a dish rag and basically gross. The toppings slid off into a pile of mush on my plate.  . I think the basic problem is that the place is being staffed by a bunch of young kids. They have no idea what they are doing, and there is no management there to help. They have a lot of money tied up in it,  and it is a shame that there is no one there to watch the shop.","This place has good ambience and service, but the pizza leaves a lot to be desired. . Initially I was impressed they offered a clam pizza. It sounded very appetizing. The flavor of it was good, but it was pretty greasy. It almost felt like there was meat in the sauce or something and I'm a vegetarian. The garlic knots were hot and well flavored, but they were pretty expensive for what you got. . My husband ordered the Margherita pizza and he said it was standard. Nothing much to write home about but not bad. Unfortunately, the middle of the slices were very soggy and heavy and it was impossible to take the pizza out of the pan. . All in all I'd say that if you were watching sports at the Aria this place is okay, but if you want some really good pizza, go to the pizza place at New York New York or one of the Italian places at the Venetian.","Good pizza and good delivery. Has improved immensely  over the years. My hubby doesn't like the wing. He finds them small and sometimes looking like they come from abused chickens. Subs are ok. Nice people working there.","Finally got to try this place with my husband and it didn't disappoint! The inside of Barnone is beautiful! I love the industrial look. It's a little hot during the AZ summer heat but it was ok. My husband had pizza and I had the farm salad both were really good and we will definitely be back. The menu isn't very big but they will deliver your food to you at the brewery or winery.","Just had dinner at Sal's and I will have to say, their pizza is amazing! I have tried other pizza Restaurants in the West Valley and theirs has to be one of the best. The pizza was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of vegetables, meats and sauce. The crust was lightly toasted and full of flavor. From now on, Sal's will be my first choice for great food and drinks.","I love this show! It's pricy but worth it! The theatre is nice and the have consession stands that serve alcohol! Course it's Vegas right? You can't bring food or drinks inside so don't try and the pictures are taken in the beginning. The line was long to get in but it doesn't matter bc your have specific seats anyway. So we waited at the pizza spot next door enjoyed some bomb pizza slices and headed in after the crowd was in. Treasure island is a pretty cool casino! We liked it!","We had a few coupons to use for this pizza joint. I had heard great things and others have had really good pizza. I ordered online for a 20 inch pizza with a few different toppings for my family and I. It said it would be ready in about 30 minutes so we went and picked it up. We had a coupon for a free 2 liter soda as well as a discount of the pizza. The restaurant was very big and it wasn't too packed. We were helped right away and the pizza was ready to go. It was really good pizza and all the correct toppings were on it which was great. Everyone loved it and I would definitely go back.","The pizza here is horrible. I've ordered it a few times because it's open 24/7 and let me tell you, it's bad. Prices are great, but it doesn't make up for pizza that tastes like left over garbage dump pizza. . The delivery guys will NEVER bring the pizza to my door. They make me walk out of my complex which is quite large. I order delivery for to the door delivery, not walk, balance two pizzas and a 2 liter while trying to type my door code in. . . no thanks. . I also had an issue, which will be my last time dealing with these idiots. I ordered a pizza, it was never delivered, and upper management is refusing to refund my credit card of the charge. They have been giving me the run around on the issue for over two weeks, and now they are flat out ignoring me, and refusing to refund me.","Had dinner here the other night for a family celebration. I ordinarily do not patronize Chinese buffet style eateries. Was happy to see that they have a short order cook on a grill as part of the buffet, ala Mongolian BBQ style. The offerings aren't as plentiful though you may select fresh veggies from the salad bar for your stir fry. Sushi was good, was pleased to see this as well. The rest of the buffet was a hodge podge including pizza and French fries next to the pot stickers and egg rolls. The dessert offerings looked picked over and tired. Atmosphere typical for this type of establishment. I would probably not return if given a choice. Sometimes you go along with the prevailing sentiment.","I find that this pizza is edible but I am confused as to why so many people think it is so spectacular-it seems to be pretty standard delivery style pizza. They have a number of non-standard toppings and specialty pizzas so that might be part of the appeal to some but I prefer plain cheese or just one topping so the quality of the sauce, cheese and crust is most important. This pizza just seems very dough heavy to me which can result in sogginess-if you like thicker crust pizza you might like this place whereas if you like thin crust pizza you probably will not.","We wandered into this place near St Catherine and Crescent early dinner hour. It is a clean, massive restaurant and there were a few tables filled. Service was good. Good with allergies. . We started with the complimentary baguette and pesto which was delicious. . We shared the Salumi plate which was okay. It had some pickled vegetables, fior de latte, Asiago, salami and a whole lot of mortadella. Generous size. . We also had:. Kid's pepperoni pizza which was a good size. Seafood risotto which was loaded with tiny scallops, not much lobster. It was good. . The lasagna which was good but enormous with an obscene amount of cheese. We brought home leftovers for all of the above.","Great pizza. This is one of the best places in this part of town in my opinion. I have eaten hear a number of times from business lunches to dinners out with the family. The servers are always happy and they are quick too. The food comes out piping hot and the aroma as soon as you enter this place knocks you out. They can accomodate larger groups as well.","This is the real deal folks. I'm picky about my pizza after having been to Manhattan and had the pizza there many times. Mama Gina's does it right. The staff are friendly and quick and Sammy behind the bar is a real gentleman. Oh and the pizza. . . . it's delicious! Five big stars. We'll be back!!","Nice ambiance and excellent service. . We got a chopped salad and cheese pizza for dinner. . The chopped salad was a little on the small side but delicious. We substituted avocado for salami and they were very happy to make the change for us. . The pizza is delicious. Heavy sauce and dare I say it too much good quality cheese. I could have done with maybe 30% less cheese. The crust was where the pizza failed. The center part was soggy. The outer half was crispy and delicious. . With so many great pizza options in town I'm not sure I'd come back. Life is too short for a soggy crust.","We have been here a couple times, . For starters I recommend the burrata ball, it is very tasty but very filling too. Their charity bread is delicious but overpriced. . If you are with someone, you should definitely take they \"social\" option, you get 2 medium sized meals in one !. Their pizzas are very tasty but very filling once again. the way they are served is interesting and you have a pair of scissors to cut them. . I would definitely come back, perfect place for lunch/dinner with friends.","Went to Carolina Ale House (CAH, as they call themselves on their menu) for lunch in a party of 9. The place was busy, as has been the case of 2 other times I have been there. The joint serves beer and pub food with lots of TVs, great place to view games. Unfortunately, the atmosphere is what you pay and go for, not the food. . I had the special, a Greek Chicken Pita. Sounds pretty good right, chicken, feta, olives, etc? The problem is that it wasn't made with care, as the pita came soggy with olive juice dripping through the bottom, as if emptied from a can. Worse, there was an olive pit in the pita, which I bit down on, OUCH. Apparently there was a warning somewhere about olive pits. . . my question, why serve something with pits that can't be easily distinguishable? Great. . . you put a warning, can I warn you that I may not pay you if I don't like the food and walk out?. The fries are flavourful, but it looked like they were rushed. Straight out of the frier and onto our plates. . . fresh is good, but usually you want to run the fries through paper towels or something to get rid of the excess grease. CAH fries apparently come with an extra serving of oil on the outside, glistening!. Other folks had the veggie pizza, a grilled chicken salad, buffalo chicken burger, and the fried fish. I think I probably got the worst of it, the other food looked like standard pub food. I had the buffalo chicken burger before and I would rate it three stars. To be honest, if CAH cooks spent 1 extra minute per plate to actually clean up the presentation, that would earn them 1 extra star. KISS, Keep It Simple &amp; Stupid. Nobody walks into CAH expecting miracle food, charge me $10, make me a good burger. Chicken pita would've been fine and good, why add olives and turn it to disaster, honestly, just stupid. . Will I go back, probably once in a bit, but their pricing makes it a rare sports event occasion  or an occasional group lunch. Maybe when March Madness rolls around, we will spend some time there for happy hour / game watching.","Called in our order on NYE and it was ready as promised. The pizza was fantastic. Nice thin crust as we remember from NY. We also ordered wings. They were disappointing as to the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. They were small, meatless, and overcooked. I have had the fingers before and they are far better.","The food is outstanding!!! I usually get their chicken sandwiches and fries. . . So amazing! It was $22 for a small pizza, cheese fries, and a whole chicken sandwich. My BF and I split it, and had a ton left over. Which isn't bad at all considering the portions. . It's a dive type of place with a bar. You can eat in or take out. It's a very random place in Greenfield, but the food was so delicious! They have a menu on their website too!","Pizza is a staple where I am from. I also grew up with a family who owned and operated pizza places and still does. This place knows pizza. The Mahalo pizza was phenomenal. Even better was the staff. Great place that is still yet to be discovered. Christy the owner was awesome as well. Good luck to them i will definitely be back if work permits me to","This place has an old style feel to it. There are two main guys who work there and everyone seems to recognize them. They even got a little cartoon on the tip jar that looks just like said 'pizza making' dudes. Guy I dealt with was very nice. White baseball cap. Grey hair. Mustache. Friendly and welcoming. Pretty cool feel for your typical pizza spot. . . . But the price is f*cking amazing. $11 large pizza? Forget about it. A little greasy(it's a pizza. What do you expect?), but extremely satisfying. Hate to sound like a glutton, but it's one of those \"you should just buy the whole pie instead of only a slice\" situations. . This was one of the first places that I visited specifically because of the Yelp reviews during my lunch. And it did not disappoint. No disrespect to Pizza Hut or Dominos, but the taste is authentic and the price is right. Don't pass this place up as I'm sure if will be your new favorite pizza spot.","My wife and I stopped in after a short walk from our nearby hotel for a meal dining in. We were, quite honestly, a little fearful when we entered the establishment due to the decor (best described as 70s Goodwill), but we were immediately won over by the smell of the place. It smelled of yeast, fresh dough, tomato sauce, herbs and more. We were further encouraged by a gracious welcome at the cash register. . The dining room consists of just three or four tables and an old covered sofa. Clearly this is a pizza house that does a busy delivery business and very little in-house service, but we were pleased to see a wall covered with thank you notes from local elementary school students spanning more than one year. . After discussing the menu with the gal behind the counter we decided on a galactic pizza and a dozen hot wings. A mere 15 minutes later we were treated to a truly tasty dinner. The pizza was topped with fresh ingredients in good proportion, and the large wings were cooked to crispy perfection. . We would absolutely recommend this gem to others, and when we return to the area we will surely visit again. It really is unfortunate that the business seems to be so focused on delivery. . . with pizza this good, a dining room makeover would surely attract a steady business of family diners.","Good pizza, used the walk up window and ordered a slice. I love the walk up window. reminds me of back home. Got the pepper and squash slice. Its the hot sweet combo thats interesting. Goes great with a cocktail","Dominos is dominos. But when I walk in and order and watch my pizza be ready for 40mins. I had to stand up and ask them to look at the name on the box an hour after I ordered. This dominos is slow. Drive 5 miles out of your way if you want it. Edit: our soda was flat. Seriously go get Ian's or drive out of your way for dominos don't go to this one","Took our son to another kids birthday party here. I would have never went if I knew they didn't like people to conceal carry. Which by the way is not against the law to carry your gun in. They can have you trespassed which is a misdemeanor. Games are way over priced. I was at a competitors a week before. Playing deal or no deal. It only cost one token. Peter piper is 4 tokens. The exact same game. We had a large pepperoni.   15. 00 dollars very over priced. I will say the pizza was good for a place that uses sub par ingredients.    . To summarize they don't support Second amendment rights, games way over priced, pizza over priced. . Pros it was clean, pizza tasted okay.","I went to Buca for the first time recently, and was greeted warmly (without reservation) and given a table straight away. I appreciated the prompt service. For appetizers, I shared the nodinis. They were divine! They came perfectly crusty and hot on the outside and warm and doughy on the inside, drizzled in a nice olive oil with garlic and sea salt on top. I think everyone would enjoy these. . My main was the pomodoro e tartufo pizza, which is essentially a pizza with tomato sauce, truffled burrata, and fresh shaved black summer truffles. For $29, it was very steep as far as pizza goes, but I love truffle and burrata so I thought it'd be worth it. The pizza was very good, however I didn't realize that the burrata would be a topping after the pizza was cooked, so it got cold quickly. The truffle taste was very light and not overpowering at all, and the crust was good. I would probably order a different one next time, but it was good. I think Libretto is the best pizza in the city so I came into Buca ready to compare and there wasn't much of a contest when considering the whole pizza. The wine and cheese lists were extensive, and if you are a fan of charcuterie you will love Buca. . For dessert, I split the Zuccotto. At $26, it's a splurge, but it was so worth it. The presentation was excellent- the dome was placed on our table, and the waiter explained what it was made up of. Then chocolate glaze was poured around it. It had a cookie base and a light, fluffy chocolate hazelnut mousse inside the chocolate/vanilla striped exterior dome. It is clear that a lot of care went into it's preparation. You can never go wrong with anything chocolate/hazelnut (at least for me that's true!) and it did not disappoint. . Buca has great ambience, great service, and great food. It's take on Italian is innovative and sure to please. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars because of my very expensive main course that was lacking compared to other 'gourmet' pizzas, but the appetizer and dessert were perfection.","The roast duck poutine pizza is one of their most famous dishes. And my mouth was watering even before it was served. It is served on a thin crust with a generous amount of fries and gravy smothered on top. There were also herbs and caramelized onions that added texture. The pizza came out fresh from the oven and was crispy which contrasted with the slippery cheese that melted in my mouth. It was the bomb. It's such a creative dish and a must try!!!!!!! Our waiter was charming and very sociable too,  and very helpful with our questions for menu recommendations. Was a golden experience.","Excellente pizza pas trop charg\u00e9 mais vu la qualit\u00e9 des ingredients et l'attention port\u00e9e a leur pr\u00e9paration, la pate croustillante et moelleuse et la sauce tomate qui go\u00fbte Rome c'est une des meilleurs pizza que j'ai manger a montreal. Si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cuite au four a bois \u00e7a serait dans mon top 3.","Great atmosphere in mid town serving authentic Napoleon style pizza. Service was authentic and great. Would definitely frequent here more often to try the other specialties which judging by tables next to me and my husband looked amazing.","Murrysville Pizza Co. is good solid pizza. We've had their pizza now three times and it hasn't let us down. I got breadsticks for the first time and they were good as well. We'll order again for sure.","I guarantee this is the worst Pizza you could ever get go to the supermarket buy a box of frozen pizza undercook it and there you have it the same taste you will get at this restaurant terrible disgraceful this should never be called the streets of New York because New York's Pizza tastes nothing like this it is enormously much better in New York. . Don't waste your money eating here","Very good restaurant. I loved the food. We were 9 people, 5 of us order the individual side pizzas and 4 of us order the pastas. Everything was delicious. . . The pizzas size is big enough for two people, they were cook on point. I had the seafood pasta and it was great. There was a lot of seafood very well proportionated, it also had lots of sauce as well as the others on the table. . Our waiter was very good. She always had a smile. . I will totally come back to this restaurant when in Montreal.","Went here last night for the first time with a group of 14 people to celebrate my husband's retirement. We had the best time! Great service and food. My husband, friend and I spit the Gotham signature pizza which was excellent! The crust was delicious and crispy. We also order garlic knots, chicken wings and jalape\u00f1o corn bread cheese poppers for the table which everyone loved. I had a mojito to drink and it was by far the best mojito I ever had! Also tried some of my other friend's chopped salad and it was so fresh, yummy and full of goodies that I couldn't stop eating it and it was big enough for 3 people to share. They let us hang out and socialize and took great care of us. Highly recommend!","Overall the food was not awful. I was glad to see they had a gluten friendly option for their pizza crust, but the pizza didn't have much cheese on it. The cheese they put on after the fact was very good however. Just not many gluten free options so I have to give at least 3 stars since they are trying. Atmosphere is good, and waitress was nice. We did wait a while at the front door to be seated when we arrived however. Overall the menu looked extensive, since I had never been to an east side before.","Garlic bread (that you get for free if you check in here) was amazing. Pizza was okay. We shared the margherita pizza. Nothing special, but good value for something not expensive and easy to eat in Vegas. Friendly waiter","Amazing pizza! Amazing Mexican food and hot wings! We order from these guys a lot and never had a bad experience with them. Thanks US Pizza!!!","Pretty good service, they made a mistake on our pizza but quickly made a new one while keeping the other one as well. Ranch is amazing pizza and wings good too.","Great location, incredible vegan foods, and amazing service in a very casual yet elegant setting. Everything here is freshly made (from smoothies to pizzas dairy free deserts) Even if you are not a vegan, you are going to love this place!","Finally made it to this large, loud, dimly lit Italian resto. The verdict: Not bad, not fantastic. . True, I had super high expectations given all the positive word-of-mouth. . . also, every time I tried to make a reservation for an upcoming Saturday, they were fully booked. I ended up reserving a table a few weeks in advance, which just added to my expectations of greatness. . Homemade \"naked\" mozzarella - yummy but a little tough to cut through; not as soft/creamy as I expect fresh mozzarella to be. (However, bonus points for the dollop of jam and the generous pile of sea salt. ). Margherita pizza - so thin they give you special scissors to cut it! The pizza (flavours, crust) was just okay, nothing special. . Meatballs with fettuccine - the meatball was quite tasty; pasta was a bit forgettable. (Tip: For dynamite Italian meatballs try Seven Numbers uptown on Eglinton. ). On the plus side, the portions were very generous. . . my companion and I split the pasta/meatballs and they offered to divide the dish in the kitchen and serve it on separate plates (love that). When it arrived, it looked like two full-sized entrees. . Sangria is excellent. . TIP: Even though the address says Yonge St, the entrance is on Gerrard.","Pittsburgh institution. Great snap dogs grilled to perfection. Have the chilli as a free topping. The pizza here is great and greasy. If you like fresh fries this is your place. The large can feed a family of 6. If your in Oakland this is most stop.","I was craving pizza - but I just wanted a slice. . . Slice On Broadway filled my craving and left me wanting more! Staff was exceptional and pizza was amazing will be coming back for more!","I have never had any issues. Very good pizza and they will make whatever kind you want fresh and deliver to your table. $5. 99 buffet for salad, pizza, pasta, soup, and dessert is a great price. Kids 3 and under eat free as well. The manager has always ben very nice and accommodating to our needs/wants. Try the buffalo chicken pizza, its amazing!","Are you kidding me!? This was SO freakin' fun I cannot even put it in words! I have honestly never painted a day in my life and I managed to pull off a pretty amazing painting (maybe it was the beers! haha---which by the way were happy hour $3. 50/each with $5 pizzas?! so even THAT was amazing! All deals you get at the bar when you're there for Paint Nite! The night we went, we were at PT's on W. Post Rd). It was a night so worth it. Had so much fun and so many laughs and then you take home a finished product. I will definitely be doing it again! And update: We did it again, with 6 of us from my family! Had a great time 2nd time around too!","One hard working red head all by herself on game night was extremely helpful. She quickly made our pizza and wings. While keeping a smile on her face she busted her butt to complete orders left and right. I was in and out quicker than expected. This girl deserves a kudos.","Pretty run of the mill bad pizza. Tasted like re heated tombstone or other home made. But the place was clean and the guy behind the counter seemed ok.","Our hockey team recently stayed here for a tournament and I have to say, this is the BEST STAFFED hotel we have stayed in for a very long time. The rooms were ok, beds small but comfy. Clean. Great pool. . . . etc. But the SERVICE. . . . We had an early game that would have made us late for breakfast and they HELD it over for us. . . . . They allowed us use of their breakfast room for a team dinner when pizza was delivered. They met every need possible in an amazing turn around time. They kept our team together in one section of the hotel so the boys could play in the hall way without bothering other guests. One of the biggest compliments that I can give is this. . . . . one of our boys because ill and they were there within minutes. . . . . not just to change bedding and clean the carpet but they brought ginger ale to help him feel better. They were amazing!! If we are ever in another tournament in Pittsburgh, I hope we are assigned this hotel again! You can't ask for better staff!!! Thank you for a wonderful stay!","Bad service, Bland Pizza, and really really overpriced. The whole night, we only saw our waitress maybe 3 times (not even busy, like four tables out of the whole place had people). With the pizza, there wasn't any pazzaz to it. . . Very bland. and lastly; with two people and no appetizers or alcohol, the bill ended up being about $75. For those prices, i'd expect a much better experience. With service and food.","Really, really delicious pizza and probably some of the best garlic bread I've ever had. If you check in on Yelp they'll give it to you for free, too!. The pizza with the broccolini and artichokes was stellar. I only wish they hadn't been out of half of their beer tap, there was a wheat beer I wanted to try that they were out of. . Affordable for being part of the Strip.","Where do you go when you 1) want artisan pizza, 2) don't want to pay for artisan pizza, 3) are ok with not actually having \"artisan\" pizza as long as it's not a goopy mess and delivery is available? This place! We are very fortunate to live about a mile away from Pasta Brioni and that they deliver decent non-commercial Italian food for a reasonable price. . The food is good, for all that the word \"good\" encompasses. The portobello salad is actually quite tasty, and the ravioli appetizer is definitely a guilty but delicious indulgence. However, we alway crave their pizza on lazy Sundays when we don't want to cook or really make an effort to go somewhere (there is usually football watching involved). The pizza is really good - a tad greasy for my taste, but the quality is terrific for the price. For about $16, you can get a huge margherita or 4 cheese (oh my Gogonzola!) at your doorstep in an hour. Ok an hour seems like a while for one pizza, but we've already admitted to the laziness. . . so we suck it up and bide our time with beer. . Definitely recommend a quality, small local joint like this over ANYTHING with a coupon in the Sunday paper.","We tried Vocelli's for the first time tonight and found it to be great! The guy who answered the phone spoke clearly, listened well, and our order was correct! We were told 30 - 45 minutes for delivery but our order arrived in about 25 minutes. We ordered the Hunger Buster, large one topping pizza, one hoagie, bread sticks, and a 2 liter of soda. The pizza was hot, as in fresh out of the oven HOT! and the pepperoni topping was just curled and crisped, the hoagie was on a fresh bun and it didn't have a greasy river pouring off it, the bread sticks were exactly that, bread sticks. They took freash dough and baked it till a crust on the outside but still soft on the inside them covered it in garlic butter and parmesan cheese. For $25. 00 it was a meal for two days! Will definitely be calling them again!","Hits the spot when I am craving Chicago thin crust pizza. The pizza and wings are fantastic, I haven't had anything else. The customer service at this location sucks though, every time I call in an order I wonder if I am going to get it and if it will be right.","This is my all time favorite pizza place in Las Vegas! There is nothing better than finishing a hike or rock climbing at Red Rocks and grabbing dinner here! Garlic knots are amazing, Stromboli is great, and of course the pizza slices are huge! The only thing that could make this place better is delivery to Henderson, but that's why it's such a treat. Highly recommend this place to friends and strangers alike :)","Came here with a friend and all our kiddos for lunch. They were super quick to take orders &amp; bring out the drinks. They even did half water half fruit punch for the kids drinks. We split a large pizza &amp; when it came out it looked perfect. Once we started eating it we realized it tasted pretty perfect. It was nice and thin but not over sauced or cheesed. And our total was very affordable. I would come back here again.","Take your pick: . (Sunday evening, party of 7). -The absentee, surly waiter. -The water dripping from the A/C ducts into our heads. -The overly greasy pizza. -The ravioli literally sitting in oil. -The half-hearted oil &amp; vinegar dipping mixture on the table. -The high prices. -The Slow service, despite being one of only five parties dining. -The loud music that desperately screamed 'we're a cool restaurant. . . we promise!'","My husband and I stopped by for dinner on a whim. Our waitress was fantastic with recommending everything from appetizers to drinks and desserts. We had soup, an appetizer, the filet (melt in your mouth delicious), a pizza, and a dessert. Also had two classes of wine, a cocktail and a beer. Every single item was absolutely delicious. We will definitely be back over and over again.","It's not the fanciest place you ever go to, but it's not supposed to be, it's a nice laid-back bar with good pizza and wings.","well I was hoping this place would blow my socks off, but alas, my socks stayed tightly in tact. I had been waiting for this place to open for a few weeks and been checking out the menu in the window and online (I'm at the Golds every morning, not just a creepy window stalker). We finally got a chance to go a few weekends ago and man, was I disappointed. They were busy, which is expected on a Friday night. We had to sit in the lobby of the hotel, which we did but was super awkward. We ordered a few drinks and hit the menu. I ordered the deviled eggs and wifey got teh cheese plate. I went with the short ribs with blue cheese grits while wifey went with teh ricotta pizza with pork belly. The apps were done right, no complaints there. I liked the crispy bacon under the mix in the midle of the eggs, nice touch. The entrees, on the other hand, were sub par. My \"short rib\" dish was a large beef rib, and not a true short rib. I'm not THAT picky, but when I want short ribs, I want actual short ribs. the meat was super chewy, essentialy beef jerky on a large stick. The glaze tasted good but after wrestling with the knife to cut off a few pieces, that was it. The grits were also bland, no blue cheese to be found. Wifey's pizza should have read as Pork Belly pizza  and it would have been on point. Now I know it sounds crazy to compain about too much pork belly, but the entire thing was pork belly and there was no ricotta to be found. it was also super salty and just not very good. The server comped my short ribs due to them being inedible, which was very gracious. I had high hopes for this place and will give it another shot. I'm hoping it doesn't go the way of St Francis where it's got tons of potential, but simply can't deliver","Ordered on my mobile app. When we got there, we paid and saw our pizza come out of the oven. Waited 5 minutes before the guy behind the counter got around to give us our pizza that was clearly sitting on top of the oven. He was busy cleaning he said.","I would've given Bannock a 4 if it weren't for the following:. - went there with co-workers for lunch around noon on a weekday, it wasn't very busy yet the hostess asked us if we would be okay with getting seated at a high top table. All four of us are between 5' and 5'2. . . seating at a high top table with our legs dangling all meal seemed ridiculous, especially since the place was half empty. When I asked her again if she had seating at a normal table for 4, she glanced at her sheet and said she actually did so we got seated there. No idea why they would try to give us uncomfortable seating as the first option?! made me feel unwelcome. - heard a LOT about the duck poutine pizza, the fries were a little cold and tasted frozen not fresh, the duck was delish but the pizza bread was awful. . . it was an arm workout to cut it with the knife they provided. . Pro's:. - my friend ordered the mushroom pizza, it was delicious, same issue with the bread being difficult to slice but the mushrooms were super fresh. - reasonably priced. - service was attentive. - one of my friend's meals was the last to arrive, after we all received ours, so they gave her a complimentary soup which was really thoughtful","My favorite pizza in the city. I drive 20 minutes to get it with zero hesitation. Soups are great too.","Great find!     We needed a quick fix before heading over to a late show. This place was great. Cashier was very polite and professional and pizza chefs were very helpful. Good pizza - loved the Vegan cheese. We will be back.","Man, does this place suck. TRUST THE REVIEWS! I ignored the negative ratings, and that was a mistake. I ordered a large pepperoni and pineapple pizza with EXTRA sauce. What I got: Large pizza half pepperoni and half ham &amp; pineapple with \"easy\" sauce?? This place is a joke. Drive to a different one - it's worth the gas.","Stay away. I'm a woman that just experience verbal assault by a sexist manager. . This is the most disturbing experience I've ever had. They completely messed up our pizza order, took an hour to deliver it then an hour to come back and reimburse us then wanted the whole pizza back as if we should pay for their mistake by not eating.  when we told them we had already eaten some of it they wouldn't reimburse us. . When I talked to the manager about it he was rude. He talked over me, When I said this was not very good customer service he said \"so what\".  . The managers name is Rick and he's sexist misogynist and a very bad man.  . Also the food is terrible.","The food is amazing. Customer service is OK. sort of. . I came in for lunch with a friend. We had no idea what to expect, so of course I check the reviews and I see they got great ones!  So, we decided to check it out. I stood for a while staring at the menu because I didn't know what to order. It wasn't that there were too many or too little amount of items to choose from, but they all sounded delicious. I decided on 1 slice of mushroom pizza and the lunch special chicken wings. It was a pretty good deal. My friend's food came out first. She ordered the meatball sub and fried ravioli.  (The ravioli appetizer is to die!) My slice of pizza finally came out but I didn't want to start eating until all my food was ready. . . Waiting. . . . Waiting. . Waiting. . . . . . . . . . . . My wings took forever!!! I ended up taking a few bites of my pizza while I wait for the rest. Pizza was amazing!!! Crust. Perfect. Cheese. Perfect. Mushrooms. Perfect. I usually dip my pizza in ranch but I didn't even need it. With the pizza almost done. . STILL waiting on wings. My friend finished eating before my food even came out; such an inconvenience!  I would give this place more stars if I didn't have to wait so long just for an order of chicken wings. Did they have to hunt down the chicken first?","This was the first time we tried Vocelli. Tired of the chain pizza garbage, this was a great choice! Awesome pizza, fresh salad, and the Vocelli rolls were incredible! We had a bit of a wait (about 50 minutes) but it was a Friday night. Reasonable prices. I would not hesitate to order again.","A very small tucked away little pizza shop, family owned and run like a NY pizzeria. One of my favorite pizza places in Vegas. Expect it to be busy at times and to have to wait. Try the Zeppolis!   :-)","So we recently moved to Brookline and this place is just up the road. Having a great pizza shop within walking distance is a great thing, unfortunately it is not this place. . . After two orders of undercooked pizza we tried a final time tonight and specifically asked for the pizza \"well done\" hoping that way it would come out cooked correctly. Sadly this was the most undercooked yet and since neither of us enjoy raw dough we won't be back. .","First I'd like to say that Nick and Angie have done a tremendous job bringing great beer to the burgh. . . this was my go to for one of kind, can't get anywhere else beer. Sadly, I noticed a trend of serving beers under 7% in snifters a few months ago.  $7 or 8 for 10oz of a beer I can get anywhere else in a pint is just a little presumptous and overpriced. If you look at their draft list, there are few beers than make it into a pint glass now. Snifters and tulips seem to be the norm. I'm sad to say I've stopped going to Caliente because of this. While I love what they bring to the table and their pizza is really good. . . I can go elsewhere and spend less, and have the same experience and beer now. I'd suggest happy hour if you want to try it out. Half priced drafts from 430-630pm.","Best pizza I've had in a looong time. Great for just hanging out with friends in the bar area, or even coming with family, hanging out and playing games in the restaurant area. Aside from the pizza, wings, chili cheese fries (green chili, mmmmm) and apps are awesome. My official go to place now.","Your local Boston Pizza with decent food served with a smile. . The location of this BP's is a huge convenience for me, so I've popped by a few times. Generally, I enjoy the food at BP's and know that it's a safe bet for a late night meal or a casual beer on the way back home. For this location, I have only been on the lounge side and it was a whole wall of VLT's with plenty of large TVs that have various sports events on. The service I've received at this location has always been good and friendly with the generally above average food I've come to expect. . I'm sure I'll be back for more perogy pizza and boston brute sandwiches in the future.","The mentions of waiting and waiting turned me off from coming here for a long time. We went on a Tuesday night around 630p and there was no wait. I think we got lucky considering it had just opened for the night but in the hour we spent there it filled up quickly. Once we got inside I could see why there's usually a wait - the place is small! Our waiter was really nice and came by at just the right times. He suggested we order three plates per person. We ordered the tuna tacos, the flatbread, the wings, the fries and a sushi roll. . Tuna tacos ($11); they come as an order of three. We got 4 instead for an upcharge I'm sure. Why have items come in threes when it's a sharing kind of place? Then someone is a jerk for eating the last one and someone feels like they got shorted one. These were good and I would recommend. They're two bites each. . Flatbread ($10) was dripping with cheese and honey; should just be called a mini pizza. Not very refined and sticky. . Korean wings ($9) were also really sticky. Don't order these unless you want to get up to go wash your hands. . Fries ($6) were like truffle fries at any other place; similar to the ones at Good Food on Montford. Greasy. Skip. . Queen Charlotte Roll ($10) was probably the best part of our meal; 8 pieces, I've had better but at least this was what we expected it to be. We ordered the fresh wasabi to go with this ($5). About a dime sized portion (see picture). All of the above plus 1 cocktail and 1 beer came to $72. Is this real life? The quantity of food is very disproportionate to the cost. We should have just stuck with sushi because at least the price on the rolls is proportionate to the size of the item. It was okay but I wouldn't come back here. The reason we finally came was because we'd received a gift card from a friend. In theory being able to order items from different cuisines sounds like a good idea but in practice all those foods shouldn't mix. We both felt off afterwards. Save your money and your stomach for someplace else.","Very funky restaurant with cool decor. Drinks pricey but fast. I had the Akira Back sakatini and Yasuke sour. The menu is actually quite extensive and hard to pick and choose. The Tuna pizza with truffle oil was AWESOME! I also really like the kimchi and bacon fried rice. The wagyu short ribs were very moist but a bit cool when served. I think if it was hotter the beef would be even more melt in your mouth. . The spicy tuna roll was really good and the miso cod was nice. I would consider going back but probably would have preferred more of a tasting menu or chef selection. The waiter was not super helpful with the food selection and I felt a bit rushed through the meal at times.","This place has definitely improved since the new ownership. Good pizza and wings and great prices. Always good service and fast as well. I highly recommend going to this place for your local pizza spot.","Close to my house so I go here once and a while. Slices have usually been sitting around but for a whole pizza they're pretty decent","This was our first time enjoying Mama's Pizza!  Loved it!  The Sicilian pizza was excellent as were the choices of beer. The homemade house dressing was very unique and tasty!  Out server (Emily) was very friendly and offered great suggestions!   Definitely will be back to try other entr\u00e9es!!","As far as chains go, CPK is A-ok! I have never had a bad meal here, at the same time, though I have never had a \"blow my mind\" meal here either. I met my dad last night for dinner and we ended up splitting a  half portion of the thai crunch salad (veggies, cilantro, peanuts, wontons, rice sticks, and thai peanut dressing) and a BBQ chicken pizza with bacon (bbq sauce, chicken, gouda, red onion, and cilantro). The pizza was a 6 cut and was perfect for splitting. The crust was more, shall we say \"crisp\", than I would have liked but the flavors were all there, perhaps a little too much cilantro though. The bacon, per my dad's request, was ok-did not particularly add to the pizza much and I would have been fine without it actually. The salad was a nice size for splitting since we were going to share the pizza already. I really liked the peanut dressing. Our bill came to $30 and was very reasonable. This is one of my dad's favorite places to have dinner so I will be back for sure.","There are many arguments about the best pizza in The 'Burgh. However I will tell you that this place is easily one of THE best. . We live in The Strip so I may be a bit biased, but Bella Notte definitely delivers great flavors, crispy crust, and a favorable amount of cheese. The staff is super friendly and the beer list is substantial. . If you want to eat there on a weekend, be prepared to wait for a table because like everywhere in The Strip, weekends are their busiest time. However if you're willing to venture out on a week night you're almost guaranteed to get a seat right away. . We love this place and are regular customers. For me, pizza doesn't get much better than Bella Notte.","A friend took me here for lunch. It's located on Bell Road, a busy north Phoenix thoroughfare in a car dealer ghetto just off of I-17. I could smell the place before we got into the parking lot. I knew those would be good. . I got a chopped brisket sandwich and a cup of potato salad. Friend ordered pulled pork and grilled broccoli which I coveted, even though there was nothing wrong with the obviously homemade potato salad, I'm going for the veggies next time. I had no regrets about the brisket which was smokey and tender. A variety of sauces stood at a continent track which I sampled sparingly to avoid covering the smokey goodness of the brisket. . We were having family over that evening and had planned for pizza. Making a command decision, I  bought a pound of pork and a half pound of brisket. At home I laid the meat out on a plate to warm in the microwave. The brisket had a nice red smoke ring, with tarty scorched ends. The pork was tender, pleasantly stringy, and succulent, even after being refrigerated and microwaved. Naked Barbecue is one of the best two barbecue jointed I've sampled in Phoenix. Of you're looking for authentic slow-smoked barbecue, I suggest you Go Naked.","The health department rating is an \"A\" and the food was great. Yeah, it took 20+ minutes but it was made fresh!!  They have $1. 00 slice if pizza on Mondays and Tuesdays!  Enjoy. . .","We have visited Heart and Soul Cafe a few times in the past 6 months. They are consistent on good service and good food. The place is clean. We have had salad, sandwich, and pizza. . The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. . This is a spot we pop in when out running errands and need a bite.","Like this little place a whole bunch!! Always interesting and unique beers. And, although we've never done anything else, the pizza is honest and well prepared. Not sure why they don't rate better in the \"best of\" rankings. This is a simple neighborhood bar with friendly staff and reliable food. Can be a bit noisy and crowded. But if you get here early and stay through \"the game\", you're sure to have a good time!!","Great restaurant located in the Mirage. Wonderful atmosphere, service was great and pizza was delicious. Definitely recommend the Margherita pizza. My boyfriend ordered pasta and loved it. Not overpriced either like most Vegas restaurants. Oh also the Tiramisu is to die for!!!!","5 stars for atmosphere, 5 stars for taste. 1 star for service. Our waiter was nice and had a great personality, however one of the worst servers I've had in a while. My husband and I each ordered a beer (It's St Pattys day, so obligatory), and our almost 4 year old an orange juice. Waters for all three. Received the beers and the OJ which was presented in a pint glass with a straw. . . for a three year old. Upon taking our order our son spilled the OJ in front of the waiter and the waiter watched as we franticly tried to mop up the mess, never offering assistance. We ordered fried pickles, a pizza and a burger with NO avocado aioli. 30 mins went by, still no water, no check in and tables that arrived after us received appetizers.  (It was lunch, and not busy what so ever. )  I finally flagged down our server and asked for waters and a status on the pickles. Immediately water and pickles arrived, as well as our food. Pickles were the best fried dills we've had in a while, and pizza was perfect as ordered. Burger- smothered in avocado aioli with extra avocado on the side. Husband said it tasted great after he wiped off the dreaded avocado spread (it's a good thing he just doesn't like it and isn't allergic. . . we'd have problems if he was. )  No ask if we needed anything, no offer of condiments nor were any available at the table. Waiter checked in once we cleaned our plates and was prompt to bring the check and collect his tip. Woman who I assume based on pictures is the manager gave us glares each time she walked by, and even served the other tables but not our own. Not sure what's going on with the employment structure here, but was sadly disappointed that our first visit to a icon for Tempe was run in such a manner. I have been a Tempe resident for 10 year and the husband well over 20. We will return, but with the knowledge the service may be sub par. At least everything tasted great!","Quick service. Clean unassuming dining room. Delicious pizza. Lowest prices in the city.","I am so excited to have a Long Wong's in my neighborhood. It's Friday and time to celebrate so we ordered take out. . We ordered the Small Family Special, 24 wings with two sauces and a 16\" one topping pizza ($26. 99, extra toppings $1. 75)  We had pepperoni and added sausage and extra cheese. We also ordered potato skins and carrots and celery with ranch. All this food was only $41 and some change. Super fair pricing with more food for your money in my opinion. . Long Wong's didn't disappoint on the wings. We had garlic parmesan and BBQ.  The wings were big and perfectly cooked with just little crunch. The garlic parmesan is a white saucex nice and garlicky but not overpowering. The BBQ was just right, not to tangy, not too sweet.  . The pizza was big and super cheesy with extra cheese on it. The slices were big too. You will definitely be full. . The potato skins were delicious with yummy cheese and bacon. The order was nice sized, I think 10 halves for $5. 75. Definitely a great value! . The large order of carrots and celery with ranch was only $1. 75 and I was glad to see this on the menu. It's a must have item when eating pizza and wings. . All in all, this place was a fabulous way to end a hectic week. Everyone was pleasantly fed for a fair price and the order was prepared quickly. Nice staff too!  We will be back!","I had Marco's delivered to a hotel and specifically requested plates, parmesan, and red pepper flakes. The young man I spoke to kinda of brushed my request off as if it was a given that I would receive these items. Pizza was delivered WITHOUT plates, cheese or pepper. My family loves Marco pizza, but when you drop the ball like this, it makes me want to go elsewhere.","Ive eaten here twice now. Both times were a great disappointment. First time I ordered pizza it was burnt so badly I couldnt eat it. . The second time I ordered the meatballs and pasta. The sauce is so bland it makes store bought taste great ! . Please do yourself a huge favor and try one of the many other restaurants in town. You will thank me later.","Excellent, excellent! The restaurant was clean, the service attentive, the hostess, waitress and the rest of the staff were friendly and fun. We went the Mama Gina's a week ago, ordered four pizzas (meat lover's, hawaiian, margherita and bbq chicken) and an appetizer sampler, and everything was fresh, hot and tasted great. The fries are addictive; crispy-crunchy outside, tender inside. We will definitely be back!","Very good wood fired pizza w homemade mozzarella. Each pie serves one and prices reasonable. Service was great and quick at lunch. Would go again.","A favorite ahwatukee spot that never disappoints. Ordered carryout last night and got our usual Yukon Gold Pizza. This pizza has been our favorite for years and we rarely deviate. The potatoes are thinly sliced, the pancetta and Gorgonzola are perfect compliments. We tried it on the whole wheat crust for the first time and it didn't disappoint so if you prefer whole wheat give it a try! We always get the egg on the pizza and recommend you so too! We also always get a salad to go with and there isn't a bad choice on the menu. Last night we had the chopped chicken. It's a great blend of ingredients and the pine nuts add a nice crunch. Do yourself a favor and check out Nellos soon. You can't go wrong with anything on this menu, we've tried almost everything and NEVER had a subpar meal. The customer service here is always top notch as well. Family friendly but also good for a date night. Tip:  If you order the Yukon gold pizza, get the egg!!! It really takes the pizza to the next level. The weekends are busy so you may have to wait a few minutes for a table, but its worth it!","Great late night pizza. Sad to see the reviews so low. Service is a little lacking but I'm from LA were people are rarely friendly anyway. . . I don't usually get bent out of shape when someone is \"rude\" just seems like they are under staffed and pretty busy making fresh pizza. There is one guy who works there that is very upbeat and friendly. Great pick up specials as well. Try it. . . It's pizza can't really mess that up.","Excellent service, very clean! Great selection of slices and panzerottis . Quick cooks friendly. . Always fresh! Never old and stale slices. I constantly see them replenishing and making fresh pizzas for slices. . .","I only gave it a 1 star as it wasn't possible to score it less. We stopped there for dinner, they weren't very busy, not unusual since it's Tuesday. We ordered a small house salad, with grilled chicken and a personal pizza. It took over 30 minutes to get the salad. We finished the salad and was told the pizza would be out soon. I was drinking ice tea. The waitress re-filled it, and when I took a sip it wasn't tea - it was coffee. I told the waitress about it, and her response was they don't service coffee, and got me a fresh drink. At one point a server stopped by to ask if we had our pizza. Forty-five minutes later I went to find her to tell her to bring us our check for the salad, ice tea and soda as we were leaving. Before they brought the check, the pizza arrived - in a to go carton. I told them we didn't want it, and then we had to wait for the manager to deduct it from our check. Manager never came out - they said they were slow because they had a new cook, yet other, larger tables were being served in less time. Ironically, one of the handicap parking spots in front of the restaurant had a 15 min parking limit. Not sure you could get much in that amount of time. Don't waste your time or money on this place. You have a choice when you go out to dinner -don't chose this place.","this place was recommended to me by two older italian guys who have been around the block a few times. first, i've never had chicago deep dish style pizza. i've had plenty of sicilian pizza. i ordered the large deep dish with meat all over it. good quality pizza, alot of sauce, and lots of toppings. very flavorful. it's made  just like how a deep dish is suppose to be, but i thought it would be taller / deeper. don't get me wrong, it's a very good pizza. i thought the thickness of the dough was very similar to sicilian, rather then a deep pie. maybe this is how it's suppose to be? anyway, the large was very filling. there's alot of sauce &amp; toppings. very small place. order ahead of time because of the 45 minutes it takes to cook. you can order it to go, or order and have it ready when you arrive. they serve alcohol as well. others i know swear by this place.","Been going to Nello's for years, but after last night, I'm taking some time off and spending my pizza $ elsewhere. Not crowded, table for 3 in the bar. . . . 2 entrees came out quickly while I waited for a woodfired pizza. My wife's salad was missing the pancetta as advertised. My pizza finally arrived but was made incorrectly. . . I was told no problem, we'll make another one. . . . waited, waited and bingo ANOTHER wrong pizza - this time it wasn't even close. After 2 hours I asked for the check and I'm gone. Nello's get it together please and do something about your pizza dough - it's like cardboard lately. Headed to Florencia for a while. . . . and so is my $.","Just got my pizza minus a key ingredient! Why the 5star review? They handled that shit promptly, without question. For a 24 spot, the service is on point.","Parking lot was packed! So I was hoping that it would be a good indicator that it was good food. . I was not disappointed!  We had the nachos for an appetizer and it was better than I could have imagined! Seasoned ground beef, homemade cheese sauce, jalapenos and all the goodies!  We also had the bbq chicken pizza and it smelled amazing! AND tasted even better!  Service was good, food came out super fast, even though it was busy.","I had a great experience at Rocco's and can't wait to return! This is only based off of one take out order. When I walked in I saw a bunch of pizzas and goodies all around me. It smelled so good! The employee that took care of me was super friendly and the pizza was ready at the time they told me! I ordered the white pizza and I'm happy I did! The crust is perfect, the pizza is thin! Delicious cheese and garlic sauce! I will order another white pizza but next time I'm going to ask for half of the fresh ricotta cheese. I do like ricotta, however it was just a little too overbearing for me on the pizza! I got the large for $15. It is pretty big! I can't wait to try just a plain cheese pizza! I will return to Rocco's!!","I like the fresh taste of their pizza. Don't know the ambience or service -we always do takeout. Preferable to typical chain pizza.","We went tonight, thinking it might be kinda crowded, since it's Saturday. It wasn't too busy. . . we went after 9pm. The staff is really nice. . We had pizza and wings. The BBQ wings were smokin' when they got to our table, and were really tasty. Crispy and tender at the same time, just how we like 'em!  The pizza was fresh and delicious. The cheese was perfectly melted and the crust was flavorful. We also enjoyed their ranch dressing, with both the wings and pizza (we like to dip the crust into it). . Overall we really enjoyed our experience. Next time, I wanna try either a sandwich or a dish. But, tonight we were in a pizza mood.","What to say about this place didn't really get a try the pizza too much after waiting 40 minutes for the food they made it wrong the couple bites that I had I was not impressed at all Italian beef that's horrible I think I could have got better sandwich at Arby's the Greek salad was very small mediocre dressing had no flavor the tomato soup tastes like something out of a can overall very disappointed only thing it made it worthwhile was the manager comp in the mail and sending us home with a spinach pizza tried that one was not very good but thanks to the manager I will give it another chance maybe in a few months after they've been open for a while","When I lived in Cleveland, this was my favorite Italian restaurant. It's locally owned, and they make their own sauce. They were shut down for a while remodeling, and I was having withdrawals. Thankfully, they sell their sauce at the grocery store, so I had a little saving grace. When they did open back up, my fiance and I went, and the remodel was beautiful. The space is larger, and the furnishings are all brand new. Enough about the building, though, let's talk about the food!. Their pizza is out of this world good! I moved to Georgia for the weather, but if I ever return to Cleveland, it will be for Stancato's pizza. When my parents visited Cleveland, we would always go here for the food. Their pasta dishes are pretty good size, and also quite delicious. I have not found this quality of Italian food anywhere else I have lived. I highly recommend checking this place out!","A quick stop in for a bite and it was wonderful to see the new modern changes of this old haunt. . Excellent TV's and a NEW server that was backed up by a seasoned pro, making sure we had everything we wanted. As expected the ownership team was present and welcoming, that was my favorite part. . We shared some wings and a pizza and both were great. The Pizza crust is 2 large flour tortillas melded together with some melted cheese then over topped with great sauce, above average mozzarella and lots' of meat, it was almost executed perfect but still real good. the wings are large with a great classic Buffalo sauce. both ranch and bleu cheese served as requested. Awesome crisp celery and carrots served along side and that was FRESH! These wings are about a million times better then BWW and a far better deal. . I really like this great little sports bar with a great personal touch, Great food and really good service.","We used to go to Beach Pizza in Playa Del Rey, CA and was happy to see one here in Vegas. The pizza is wonderful!!!!  Good selection of kids items as well. We have ordered food multiple times now and have received consistent food and service.","Tried this place for the 1st time. We ordered the pizza and boneless wing special. Pepperoni pizza with garlic crust and 10 boneless hot and 10 boneless hot BBQ. The pizza was very good- the garlic crust was tasty. They also sprinkle oregano on the pizza- it was ok but I think they should ask if the customer wants it on there. Overall I liked the pizza- great value and quality. Now the boneless wings were more like popcorn chicken- kind is small round nuggets. The hot BBQ was better than the plain hot, but still small for the price. They also only give 2 very small containers of ranch- the ranch was good, just not enough. . I have not tried any other food item yet, but I will.","Great food and great service! Cool place we stumbled upon! We had the margherita pizza, wings, and pork sliders. All were fantastic!","I was going to try a place called Goodfellas Pizza and go on a whole Jersey Shore rant. But i decided to support one of my favorite businesses instead. I had the Sunrise today. Whipped eggs and peppers on pizza makes a good breakfast when waking up at 3 in the afternoon. The Atlantis and Eastern star were tasty on my pre-holiday visit in November. They have added a couple new specialty pies since i first came here. . Today i got to chill on their couch and read letters on the wall from local kids. They thanked Carol for donating pizza to their schools. This place is very cute and unique.","Came here tonight and had an excellent evening. Service was impeccable and the waitress consistently asked how I was doing. I sat at the sushi bar and was greeted by the chefs which only added to the fantastic service already provided. . Regarding the food, it was on point in terms of creativity and freshness. I ordered the tuna pizza, which I had doubts on, but it was delicious - the crust is the star. I was also able to try the Hokkaido scallop and the tuna with mustard miso sauce (I think?) thanks to the chefs recommendation and both dishes were very balanced. The botan Ebi was also very sweet and  well presented. . As far as the desert, I ordered the magic egg and it was very light which helped end the night nicely. It looked spot on like an egg! . . . I will definitely come again. Cheers.","If your hungry this is the place to order from! Barbara is so nice at the pizza place and the food is great i don't know what the previous post was talking about. . I think I might have to make this a routine stop every time I'm in vegas! =). The website above is not correct. . www. topthispizzalv. com  enjoy everyone =)","This was definitely an A-OK experience, but mostly driven by how excited my boyfriend was about having Gluten Free Pasta and Pizza so close to home. I ordered regular pizza and it was pretty good, and I tried his GF pizza and it was thin-crust and crunch - which I really like in a pizza. It either had too much sauce or gluten free dough can't absorb sauce well, and therefore the crust got soggy pretty quickly.  . I would go back again, but if it were't for the gluten free stuff, I'd probably skip it.","I've never left a 1 star review before, in fact, I hardly review at all. I couldn't help it this time. . . I stayed here with co-workers this past weekend for a convention for 3 nights at one of their \"Go\" rooms at a little more than $200 a night, including the $40 resort fee. We arrive in the room and discover that the bathroom handle was held together by plastic string and the sliding door was missing the bottom of the track. My co-worker went to use the restroom and hurt her knee from sliding it open, handle flying off and door swinging out. Then we realize that the sink was completely clogged. The handles on everything weren't cleaned and had creams/stickiness on them. The shower was mildewed, etc. . . . We contact them in the morning for a room switch and they said we had to come back, get our things out of the current room and check into the new room by 2. That was the time of the convention so I had to beg to push it to 4. They said I had to be there before 4, so I had to leave the convention 2 hours early, the whole reason of staying there. I head back to switch rooms. I ask for an upgraded room, some kind of discount for the trouble They said \"no, but here's a $25 food credit\". I switch rooms and the new room was identical as the other, and just as filthy. . There was so many other issues with this place. We had to get new key cards several times. Every card they gave us didn't work so we spent a lot of time going back and forth to the front desk for new keys. We called for a room service menu to get food for the morning, which they never brought up so we did not order food. We call to order some coffee and they said it will take 2 hours to arrive. Our sink was still clogged, light bulbs were out, no outlets. . . We probably received 3 $25 food coupons from the front desk throughout our stay because there was so many problems. . I was really happy to check out and get out of there, but when walked away I saw I got charged for a room upgrade and food. I go to the desk AGAIN (after having to go there about 6 times throughout the stay) to let them know of the charges. The food coupons didn't count and only allowed me $35 total, so I got charged on my credit card all of those \"complimentary food credits\" because they make you charge it to your room where they're supposed to deduct it. They told me I cannot combine the coupons and I only get $35. Don't get sucked into taking their food coupons that they throw freely because they will charge it to your room and leave it on your bill. I did, however, get refunded the $200 that they overcharged me for a room upgrade that I did not get. Not only that, but when we were leaving our room, the guests across from us said their entire side of the building had no water and they had to go down to the spa to take a shower. SMH. . All of this trouble and the hotel didn't try to help us with anything and basically just covered the cost of 3 slices of pizza. If they had given some kind of discount or upgrade for all of this trouble, I would have been more inclined to spend more money there, but we all decided to spend our \"fun\" money elsewhere since we were so ripped off. I will never stay here again, and will encourage my colleagues to stay elsewhere.","Great pizza and place to sit and relax. My new place when I'm craving pizza in Vegas. . Highly recommended!!!","We love pizza, my husband is from NY so we are always looking for a good place to try. Rino D's definitely delivers on major flavor and a perfect crust! We love the Greek pizza and all the Mediterranean flavors it brings just remember get extra tzatziki sauce  The pesto bread is amazing and very rustic you can tell they use real mozzarella. We will be back soon for sure!","Good food, ok prices (for Vegas) and friendly staff. Satisfied the pizza &amp; salad urge.","I have been in Vegas for 10 years, moving from IL where they have killer beef sandwiches. This restaurant was AMAZING!! Everything about it was great. The people were so nice to us. The menu was jammed packed with items that sounded so good it took me forever to decide on something. I haven't been so happy about a dinner in a long time. I HAD to yelp about it. I will be telling everyone to come here and try the beef sandwich. Delizioso!!! Cannot wait to go back and try the pizza!!","I've been missing this wonderful place. Light- casual lunch and romantic dinner in one place. Quality food, kind service, friendly cafe-style at lunch, then quiet-bar like dinner time. I love this small local place. Their pizzas, baked goods, esp. breads, salad, soups, cheese plate and etc. are all high-quality.","A little over rated in my opinion. Over priced for the size and quality. Practically a pizza served on a naan(Indian flat bread). . For the same price I feel I could have gotten more food at a chain pizza joint.","This is a pizza 73 place with a different name same crap pizza and same horrible wings just like 73 only you pay more money for the pizza here then at 73 and it's the exact same product plus it Took them one and half hours to deliver it to my  place 10mins away on a Wednesday night I'm  being generous with the 1 star rating","I've been here twice now. The first time I wanted to try their pizza but the oven was broke. I ended up only ordering a shake. I went back a second time (after a phone call ensuring the pizza oven was up and running). I was not impressed. I'm not sure what was weird about. The sauce? The cheese? I've had way better pizzas. Loved the milkshake. I give it two stars because my husband likes it and I have to tolerate it for him.","I feel bad giving this place such a bad review based on my experience a couple of months ago, and never usually dislike places this much, but here I am. I am a resident of the Bloor/Kingsway area in which this restaurant is situated. Now if you know the strip of Bloor where this restaurant is, you know that every second place is a restaurant, and they are all pretty busy. With the selection of restaurants in this area and other Italian restaurants in Etobicoke (just go to La Veranda around the corner!!) I don't know how this place stays open based on my experience. There is just so much better Italian in Etobicoke to be had. . Anyways, I have been here twice. The first time was something like 2 or 3 years ago with a friend for a casual dinner and I think I may have had a salad or something. I don't really remember my experience, I just remember I wasn't unhappy with it and generally enjoyed the experience and decor of the restaurant. But this review isn't based on that. . So a couple of months ago my boyfriend and I were craving Italian and wanted to go somewhere close by. I wanted to go somewhere new and my boyfriend hadn't been there before. Being a creature of habit, he wanted to go to La Veranda around the corner which is an Etobicoke failsafe of ours but I insisted on coming to Sempre. . My boyfriend went to culinary school and is a sous chef at a very busy Italian restaurant in Toronto and he really found the menu to be lacking. He wasn't super hungry and ordered a pizza. I ordered a pasta (don't remember what it originally was now) which took a super long time to come (even though it wasn't very busy), and when it finally came out I noticed that it really did not seem to match the description of the pasta that I had ordered. I recall that when giving my order to the waitress she seemed slightly confused with what I had asked for even though what I had ordered was right there on the menu, and I didn't ask for it with any changes or anything. I recall the pasta I originally had ordered was supposed to have a white sauce and the one I received had a rose sauce, as well as being tortellini. I was honestly so hungry at that point and not one to complain anyways that I just decided to eat it. Well, if what I had received had turned out to be good I wouldn't have been too unhappy but I honestly would equate the pasta and sauce to some crappy wedding banquet hall food. The tortellini had no flavour and tasted like something I could have boiled at home from a package from Costco. The pasta was definately not made in house. The sauce was probably the worst part and made me dislike it so much. It was just too thick, had no flavour, and just so reminescent of crappy banquet hall food and generally unpleasant. The pizza was not up to par of what you would expect to find from an Italian resto in Toronto, had not much sauce and the crust wasn't great.  . There are tons of options along the Bloor strip, if you really want Italian skip this and go to La Veranda around the corner.","Went here for a birthday party. the hostess when asked about our reservation just told us to go inside rather than show us where our table was. This was especially awkward as we didn't know the other party guests we were meeting, because our friend whose birthday it was hadn't arrived yet. . we ordered our drinks and the waitress seemed nice at first but very cut and dry and seemed only cheerful when talking to us about her sunburn and how she planned to vacation to Honduras. . from then on the service was down hill, my girlfriend had to wait 15 minutes to get a coffee, and then we had to wait another 15 minutes before we could order food and we had to ask to order food. . the music was horrible cheesy euro house music that was BLARING and we had to yell to talk to our friends beside us. WHEN WE WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT! haha ridiculous! we asked to have the music turned down, only to have them crank it back up 20 minutes later. . ordered pasta and it was \"okay\" but obviously made from store bough dry pasta, that you can get at Metro next door. i know this from the giant messy pile of pasta boxes literally stacked to the ceiling next to my head where i sat! . we read the pizza was \"good\" so we ordered their signature \" waving flag pizza\" only to get entirely plain sauceless dough that had been in the oven and raw toppings put on after wards. no melted cheese almost zero olive oil. no love put into this pizza whatsoever. . the bruschetta my friends ordered was a joke served on the same overly thin sliced tasteless bread that they toss at you for free when you sit down. . . waitress was basically never there to check on us unless we told another server to go get her. . we had to ask 3 times to be brought sparkling water, no parmesean cheese was offered and there was almost zero pepper coming out. . was brought our bill with the tip already added at about 13%. i don't think i would have tipped more than 5% had i been given the option. . and given the option, i would also never return! . laughable fake italian restaurants like this don't belong in toronto when there's better places in abundance all around us.","Upper crust has great pizza and wings. Also take out and just the same when you get it home ;) wish they delivered !","Saturday. 12/16/2017 maybe 8:10 PM. We always drive by this place and I've been looking at it for 5 years at least!  We are from Rhode Island and both my boyfriend and myself are from very Traditional European familias. I'm Portuguese and he is VERY Italian. . We are picky eaters, and the aroma of food hits you in the face when you walk in. We only like eat freshest garlic and ingredients off the vine. This delicious soft crust compliments all the ingredients. We ordered a 16\" Boss pizza no tomato. Fresh garlic, mushroom, black olives and Italian sausage. I can say this visit was very fast takeout, 15 minutes to bake in the oven and 5 minutes home. They had awards all over the wall and have helped the community. . Next time I think we should get an Italian sausage pizza because it left me craving for more!! This was excellent service but it's not as good as our favorite place. It's very close to New York style pizza with an old world flavor. I like my NY pizza greasy and dipping from the cheese. I would say I'm not sure if I should give it 4. 5 stars or more. Everybody loves this pizza place for the love baked in the food. I would like to try the chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks because I'm definitely coming back. Thank you.","Something has changed for the worse here. We are long time regulars and I have to agree with Erica V that on the last two pizzas the crust has been soggy / gummy and the sauce was runny / watery even when ordered well done and crispy. So much so I called the manager last night. This used to be good pizza but sadly no longer. They've either changed ingredients, recipes and/or chefs. Last week's sausage pizza tasted like bagged hospital grade meat.","I always get good pizza from here. . Tonight I called in my order and drove down to wait for it. As I was sitting waiting in front of the big glass window,  A driver pulls up, walks in and when the other guys went to the back he grabbed some chicken pieces and shoved it in his mouth. Then he proceeded to stick every one of his fingers into his mouth up to his knuckles. I'm not exaggerating. Then he wipes his mouth with the same hand. Then his nose, then he did his fingers again. Then his nose again. And his fingers one last time. . I thought he would at least wash his hands, but then he grabbed someones wings then he took a pizza did something with it then put the order out for pick up. I walked in real quick and asked the guy who just walked up to the counter if that order is mine, he said no I said good because if that is mine i don't want it. I told him what happened and he told the guy to wash his hands. . . . . I feel bad for the people who had this guy deliver their food tonight around 6:15pm. YUCK","Although I usually go to the El Mirage location I have been here twice leaving the gym. They are exactly the same pizza is mediocre, nothing special, wings (suicide and hot) are absolutely amazing chicken is cooked properly wings are crispy and sauce is tasty. What more can you ask for. They only give packets of blue cheese ( and charge 50 cents) which I hate but the wings are the best I have had and they pay attention to your order (most of the time) and get it correct. I have eaten wings all over the valley but somehow I always end up back at US Pizza.","Hit or miss. The first time I went the food was AMAZING so much so I I went back for a second time in a week. The first time I got a 'build your own pizza' with Alfredo sauce and chicken. The second time I ordered the same thing and they forgot the Alfredo but put it on the side, okay fine it was still good. Today, I ordered food to pick up and ordered the same pizza for a third time. I was told they didn't have Alfredo sauce for pizza only white garlic or red sauce (even after having it twice!)  I asked if they could put the Alfredo on the side like the did before, the woman taking my order said they could ( I don't understand why it can be put on the side and not the pizza. ) I picked up the food and brought it home and the \"Alfredo\" was literally warm milk with salt at the bottom LITERALLY! Needless to say, I'm beyond angry. The quality has gone down consistently since my first visit, I won't be returning.","Not a bad slice of NY style pizza for the price. My pepperoni, sausage, and bacon slice costs $3. 75. . Toppings, sauce  and cheese tasted pretty good, but the thin crust was a bit lack luster. Though cooked, it just tasted doughy and chewy. I wish the crust was more crispy. . However, for a late night pizza craving, Pop Up Pizza may just hit the spot.","I am a bit of a Barro's freak, and it's tops on my list for diet cheats. . . I've been going to other locations for years, and realized this one is actually much closer to my house. . While the menu is the same as all others, my experience with take-out pizza and wings last Sunday was a few notches above the other locations. . simply put, the food was prepared much better than other locations I've been to. . . As a whole, Barro's has RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME Pizza and some of the best wings I've had outside of The Great Lakes region. .","I'm a huge fan of Joe's BBQ, and Joe's Farm Grill is okay, but not the best.  . First, the physical facility, while quaint and has some nice history behind it, is just uncomfortable and very oddly organized (drink stations outside, other things inside). The trash cans suck royally. While I can appreciate the effort to drive recycling, having a trash can that has shapes for everything is just dumb. It results in piles of trash near the entry of them and not good for when you take a tray full of garbage to the can only to have to find a place to set it down to sort. . Food -- good. I think the burger and the pizza are probably my favorite here. Oddly you'd expecte more carryover from Joe's BBQ as far as BBQ options, but there isn't -- didn't bother me though. Sweet potatoe fries are great as is the dipping sauce that comes with it. . Shakes when in season with fresh berries are yum. Desserts sound better than they are, so I'd pass and head to Nielson's if you want a dessert instead. . As a place for larger groups it stinks -- tables are crowded and small. If you want to sit outside that may be fine, but the huge trees sometimes attract unwanted insects :-). . Overall okay if you are in the mood for something different.","I lost a little faith in this city by how celebrated this place is. Serviceable at best. Cheese blend is highly questionable, mine was rubbery really. Crust was ok. If you think this is the ultimate then I question your dedication to pizza consumption. . PS: The spot is cash only, which is also annoying.","Been going here for a couple years now for AYCE, but unfortunately, I'm starting to notice a jumping of the shark. . Sushi is still very tasty, but it's often slow getting to you and you rarely get every single item you ordered. There's always a roll here, or a sushi pizza there that doesn't come. When you ask about it you're given a nod as if it'll be tended to, and still nothing shows up. . Whether it's busy or not, service is mostly bad, as it is at many AYCE places. There's the odd server that is attentive, and when it first opened they were all great. Now it's a mixed bag, and most of them don't seem to care. . Also, you'll sometimes find your table and sometimes plates, sticky and still dirty. . Anyway, gave it a 3 because the food you actually do get it still quite good. Prices are also pretty good, and it's the best place in the area. But this place would've got a 4 or even 5 a couple years ago. . . Management needs to get things in order.","Not genuine NY pizza but still tasty. I'm from NY and the crust and style of the pizza was certainly not authentic NY style; however, it was still tasty and I'd go there again. The Broasters chicken is excellent, possibly the best fried chicken I've had. Service was very friendly and prices are fair. The chocolate cake dessert was very rich with strong dark chocolate flavor, which I loved. The appetizers we had (deep fried onion rings, cheese sticks, zucchini spears, and French fries) were ok but nothing special. The passion bread is tasty. The chicken Parmesan is average. The marinara sauce is too heavy on the oregano and you can tell when having it with the chicken parm and pasta but on the pizza you can't tell.","I was traveling in Toronto for work, and we needed some place to eat at 8:00pm on a Sunday. . . not an easy task in Canada. We chose this place because it had a wide variety of food (seafood, Asian, pizza, etc), and nothing was crazy. . . more normal, comfort food. The place next door had like cow stomach or something. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with the service and food. We ordered spring rolls for an appetizer, and then I had a mixed green salad with my mac n' cheese with bacon. Yum! The mac n' cheese was good. Breaded crumb topping, small bites of bacon, and cheesy. Taste wasn't bland at all. Our waiter was nice, and the chocolate marquise was like a chocolate mousse souffle. My coworker got the steak and was very satisfied. I'd definitely come back. The only odd thing about this place was the \"go-green\" motto, so everything looks fancy, but upon closer inspection is a cheap alternative. For example, they have battery operated \"candles\" and the cloth napkins really was made from paper. . Also looks like they had gluten-free pasta, which would've made my sister happy.","You made my heart smile. . Twice!  Is that even possible.  . Dinner was about $26 when we went on a Friday night. But oh so tasty. We had sushi, freshly made donuts, pizza (my favorite), hummus, pasta, BBQ that I couldn't get enough of, shrimp, chili, and much more. They also had huge dessert bar with creme brulee, cake, cotton candy, fruit tarts. And did I mention the freshly made donuts?  . Brunch was slightly different and had more breakfast items. I loved the omlete bar. They also had waffles later on. And yes, the donuts were in attandance.  . They're open seven days a week. . Breakfast   7:00 a. m. to 11:00 a. m. Mon. - Fri.  .

Pizza is plentiful in college towns (Gumby's, Papa John's, etc. ), but good pizza is a rarity.","It's always good. And they are always fast. They make it too easy to have pizza once a week. Kids are getting sick of it because I use them so much. . I don't know why they have bad reviews. They have been awesome","According to my friend O, Grumans Catering and Delicatessen used to be pretty sketchy looking from the outside until recently (they did some renos due to a fire). Heck, I hadn't even heard of it's existence until she suggested we check it out for a late Saturday lunch. Living in Montreal taught me a few things. If you want smoked meat, you go to Schwartz's Deli. How would Grumans compared in relation to the holy Jewish institution? Read on friend, read on. . Having just ate an early brunch at Cerezo, I wasn't exactly starving. But I'll never say no to trying a new place out so I went to meet up with a different group of friends that were also in town for Stampede. At least I was smart and shared two dishes with my friend. Then again, we always share. It's the thought bro! Parking is free on the weekends in their parking lot but you have to street park on weekdays so be aware of that!. The place is very bright with crisp white and blue lines surrounding the walls. They have a lot of food/funny quotes up on the walls which I thought was pretty clever along with a smorgasbord of Bubby's family pictures. The menu has everything you'd expect of a Jewish deli (smoked meat, reuben and matzho soup) but also has a few intriguing twists (smoked meat poutine, eggs benny and challah French toast). A little something for everyone. . - Grumans reuben ($14. 00) - smoked meat, sauerkraut, swiss cheese, Russian dressing on grilled rye bread. I haven't had a ruben for ages but this one was off the charts. The sandwich was huuuuge! Super tender, juicy smoked meat with the right amount of fat on each slice. ON POINT brah. If you're craving a sandwich, go with this one. O wanted it all to herself, so greedy. . - Challah French toast ($12. 00) - vanilla, cinnamon, saut\u00e9ed bananas, nuts and a fruit salad. To combat all the smoked meat we were indulging in, we also shared the challah French toast. Best decision ever. Challah bread is the best. Brings me back to my youth where my one buddy's mom would make it fresh out of the oven whenever I went to their place for dinner Friday nights. This one is for all the brunchies out there. The French toast was delicious - airy, fluffy and delicate. Another solid dish. . - Grumans grilled special ($13. 00) - All beef salami, smoked meat, mustard on grilled rye bread. Two buddies ordered the same thing (losers). One tidbit was that when our reuben came out, one bud said he wished he'd ordered ours instead. #winning. . Two other friends came late and ordered the matzho soup and smoked meat poutine. The poutine looked potent (in a good way). Forgot to mention our other buddy ordered the sundried tomato turkey breast but he ate it so fast, I couldn't even get a picture. I don't think you can really go wrong with ordering anything off Grumans menu. Look out for their daily specials (Tuesday - meat loaf, Wednesday - croquet, Thursday - reuben pizza, Friday - beef brisket). . They definitely give Schwartz's a run for their money.","First time trying this restaurant. It's pretty bad, expensive and the dishes taste like plastic. A last resort only, well, maybe you're better off with convenience store snacks instead. Salads are garnished with all types of peppers NOT mentioned on the menu. Caesar is laughable. Mixed lettuce with peppers, assorted veggies and a few Parmesan shavings do not a Caesar make. Design your own pasta was warmed up pasta with a bland sauce. Crispy crust on the pizza was anything but. Dessert cake was pre-manufactured and tasted full of chemicals, making me wonder exactly how long it had been in their fridge. Very disappointing, as was the 87 dollar bill before tip for lunch for three people.","Really good pizza. Reminds me of the type of pizza I would get back in Michigan. Different from domino's and other chains. Lots of menu options too. Friendly over the phone and decent delivery time.","This is a lovely restaurant with amazing food and ambiance! We loved the pizzas and pastas and enjoyed the small slices of bread on the table at the beginning of the meal. My only complaint was that it was really noisy. Otherwise, it was a great experience. We will definitely be back if we are in the area again.","Great pizza and wings !! get delivery from here at least 3 times a month definitely recommend it","DO NOT!!!!! Order through Romano's pizzeria. Horrific customer service. I was told that I would not be refunded my $20 order. . .  for my extremely cold pizza that they said was fresh out the oven. The pizza felt like it had been sitting out for a few hours . . . that's absolutely disgusting. . . . the manager refused to refund me $20. . . . I waited in my car with my 2 month old new born for almost an hour!!!! To get an extremely cold disgusting pizza. Again what horrific customer service. We had to buy an ALBOA pizza to sastify our  pizza craving. . . I would highly recommend NOT ordering through this disgusting horrific cold gross pizza place. They don't care about what they serve you. &amp; again the customer service was absolutely Terrible!!!!! My pooor new born child having to wait in the car for over an hour because they didn't have their times right. For a disgusting cold pizza that not even my dog would eat. If you want awful gross pizza then this is your place . . . other then that spend your money elsewhere. Would NEVER recommend this place to ANYONE!!!!! In this lifetime.","My family has been coming here for years. No manager on duty tonight. All the kid (workers ) are playing around behind the counter. Order was wrong. They forgot the sausage on the pizza. Fixed it by putting sausage on a cold pizza and putting it back in the oven. When you lifted a slice it all rolled off. . . . . . nice. Manager would have done it right.","Average pizza could be better!! And the portion size is very big like who needs a 28 inch pizza slice","Wanted to give this place a try after seeing it served New York style pizza. Pizza by the slice option allowed us to t et you pizza and split a sandwich. This ended up to be a great way to try different items. We got a slice of pepperoni pizza which were pretty good size slices similar to the size of a costco size slice and then ordered the Italian Bird. The bread on the sandwich was exceptional with a good mixture of spices, meats and seasoning. The sandwich was definitely the high point of the meal. You have to fold the slice like a true new yorker when eating the slice of pizza. . The place is located in the shopping plaza with the grind with a good portion of parking. The inside I dc the the restaurant is small bur nice and quaint. Liked the chalk board that listed the menu, was impressed by that. Will come back to try other items and also go to their North Scottsdale location which is closer to home.","Although it sounds like a wack-job fly-by-night TV warehouse just from the name, don't be fooled nor should you underestimate the impressiveness of this grub-haven on 15th Ave. Last weekend my friend and I had an intense craving for Greek that neither Pita Jungle nor other places could handle.  . We realized that this place Crazy Jim's might be up to the task. I had been told multiple times by friends who work in Central Phoenix about this place (another location on Washington is bonus), only to find myself busy, wanting something else, blah, blah, blah. . The freshly made gyro feta pita was heavenly. The pita was fluffy, the gyro strips were tender and flavorful and the feta cheese and tzatziki dressing were the icing on this cake, so to speak. The accompanying steak fries are thick and crispy. Bobo opted for the spicy beef pita and was lovin it. . The environs are rough around the edges, but this low-key and spartan cafe delivers, amid the sound of local radio piped in via loud speaker. The focus here is on the food and nothing else. The servers were prompt, friendly and chatty, but not too much. . The menu is rife with tantalizing options including pita pizzas, pastas, subs and burgers, but I've never desired to stray from the solid and delicious pitas.","When this place first opened it was MUCH better. Over the past couple of years though, the quality and freshness have been replaced by grease. Nothing special at all, and the older guys have been over heard making remarks about their customers to each other. Not a winning strategy with so many other pizza joints around this 'hood.","i think there are some pizza snobs reviewing this place or something, gus's is BOMB!. they used to have a deal here, the dorm room special (woa, not THAT special. . . ) it was an amazing deal that enabled me to survive college.  the dorm room special was an 18\" one topping with two 32oz drinks for about $10. WHAAAAAAT? how can you pass that up?  and in my honest opinion, i thought it tasted really good. . it's greasy, so if you're a pansy just pass-on.   pass, pansy. . . pass. . . . the inside can be pretty dirty too, but it's not like you'd come in here suit and tie now!  again some honesty here. . . i have seen a rat running around inside. . . i calmly told the workers, and they were a little less calm about it than i was haha.  never stopped me from coming back again and again though.  guess i felt the rat added the true NY character to the joint. . late night crowd can be a little interesting. . . a mix of really drunk kids and some ghetto characters just hanging out.  maybe an occasional hooker too. . . trying to lure the drunks.","What can I say? I suppose I would give them another try. My girlfriends and I went the night of the Tumbleweed tree lighting and Christmas parade. It was very busy. No it was super busy so the service was a bit slower and the pizza was just ok. Several of my friends frequently dine at Crust so it must be better on a \"regular\" night. It's in a great location and I love the patio! Yeah, I will give them another shot and see how it goes.","Hands down - the best pizza around! We've been here a few different times and we're never disappointed!!! The people here are amazing, but that's just a bonus. The pizza and fresh mozzarella are amazing!!! Cooked to perfection, high quality ingredients, even the cannolis are incredible! If the last thing I ever ate was the house made fresh mozzarella, I'd die a happy gal! Don't miss it!","Nice place and the two folks who were working were nice as well. We got 3 cokes, a 16 inch pizza, meatball sandwich and a kids spaghetti, with tax we spent $43. 30. Not cheap but authentic and very good. Kids liked it and so did mom and dad. I would go back for sure and next time get dessert, they had a ton of choices.","Some of the best Italian food in Toronto and would go up against some top restaurants across the east coast. Eggplant parm, king crab / caviar pasta, asparagus with cheese sauce and spot prawn crudo were out of this world. Cauliflower stuffed pasta, garlic knots and artichoke / potato pizza were somewhat pedestrian compared to the other food but probably would have been standouts if the other food wasn't so impressive. Will be in the rotation every trip here","We had a caprese salad and pepperoni and jalapeno pizza. All was good. We lost a little of the ambience when we were seated in \"patio\" which was a view of the strip mall. Still, food and service was good.","Food was tasty, This place has a great wine and beer selection. It has anchor stream on tap. Menu needs expansion though. I would like to see pre made combos on the pizza menu and a kids menu. I think this place has potential though if it expands its menu as the pizzas are excellent.","I used to order pizza from this place all the time when I worked in the area but haven't tried them in a few years. So, realizing different locations are owned by different people, and knowing I currently DON'T care for the one closest to my home, I thought I would try the Strongsville location to see if it has held up. This Strongsville E. O. C. P. often places coupons in local publications. I found one for a medium, two-item pizza for $8. 00, so I ordered one with mushrooms and pepperoni. . Out of the box, the medium pizza was 11 1/2 inches across, with approximately a 3/4 inch edge of crust. Fairly standard and acceptable in my estimation. The thin crust was just about the way I like it, crisp and golden on the bottom and soft and chewy, even the edge. The entire pie was about one inch thick. The sauce tasted good, with a slight tang or acidity to it. On another positive note, the mushrooms seemed to be fresh and not out-of-the-can by the way they cooked (baked) up. I thought the pie could have spent another 2-3 minutes in the oven to cook up the pepperoni and bubble up and slightly brown the cheese. But then again that might have resulted in a tougher, hard crust. So, even the next day, whether eating the leftovers cold or after heating in the microwave, the crust was still just as good. . Overall I tip my hat to The East Of Chicago Pizza in Strongsville, they seem to still be doing a credible job. Since northeast Ohio has some of the best independent pizza places you can find anywhere in the country (I know, I've tried many of them during my travels. ), I usually don't buy pizza from the national chains. For this location I don't mind making an exception.","Thank goodness my husband and I ignored  the 2 star reviews. This pizza is the real deal. None of that frufru designer stuff. Run by hard working young men who served up  New York style pizza:  greasy, thin crust with lots of cheese and tomato sauce. You can even grab a beer from the sports bar next door to complete the meal. . Thanks Tonys.","We received a free slice offer in the mail and decided to stop by for pizza and a salad. The space has a nice rustic feel with indoor and outdoor seating. There are plenty of menu options including salad, pizza and sandwiches and they also allow BYOB. The pizza and salad was great (under $3 for a slice with toppings) and this place is a great alternative to the other formal pizza parlors in the area.","Hung out with my daughter, her hubby and his brother and they all wanted to go check out the Mission at Minder Binder, so off we went. . It was around 5pm Saturday night and we got there we were told that seating in the opened patio area (by the fire pits &amp; fire place) is a self-serve area and that the bar outside was not opened yet that we would need to go inside to order drinks &amp; food so we opted to be waiting on and found a table in the covered patio area. . After inquiring what they had on tap I went with a Wasatch Apricot Hefeweizen , I have to say, this is a pretty good beer, my favorite is the Four Peak's Peach Ale, and well this one comes in a close 2nd. . After drinks were ordered it was time to figure out the food, we ordered 2 pizzas, the Sister Margarite and the Mahalo. The pizzas came out one at a time, don't know if there was a backup in the kitchen. . The Sister Margarite was the 1st pizza to reach our table, it was your basic marinara sauce, roma tomatoes, garlic &amp; basil and cheese. I really didn't care for this pizza, it just tasted bland. . Then the 2nd pizza came out when the 1st one was done, did they think the boys wouldn't have put away both pizzas? I have to say the 2nd pizza was delish, it had Applewood Smoked BACON and sweet pineapples, this was a yummy pizza. . For me, Mission @ Minder Binder is a spot to end the night with a beer by the fire pit, or even to start your night off with, good for drinks &amp; apps","Ordered through grub hub last night and was shocked! Very hard to find Italian food that delivers at midnight that's still good. Chicken parm, little Quattro formagii (4 cheese) pizza it had roasted garlic on it we loved it, and tomato basil soup. All came piping hot and delicious!!","You can never go wrong with PPP, I love the buffet during lunch, who doesn't like all you can eat pizza and salad? The play area is tiny but the games are decent. It was actually cleaner than most PPP I have been to which is a plus, but the customer service was not great. The cashier kept rushing me (probably because a line was forming behind me) and when I finally decided on the buffet she rudely said \"that's all\". Other than that it was a great experience. We will be back, hopefully the cashier was just having a bad day.","Best freaking \"thicker\" pizza on the west side! Must get the 8corner pizza! The crust is the buttery and crispy with burnt cheese on the corners!","Love this place. The two of us split everything. The Caesar salad was huge so we each got plenty. It was delicious. Then we had the incredibly yummy Burrata Mozzarella Crostini with roasted tomato and basil. We also had the Salsiccia pizza, which has sausage, fennel, and onion. The crust was tasty and perfectly cooked. The fettuccine with beef ragux was fantastic, and you could taste the freshness of the pasta. . Just an FYI - they have a decent beer and wine selection. . We finished off with the fabulously tasty lemon ricotta cheesecake, topped with fresh whipped cream. Perfectly lemony and not overly sweet. We each had a cappuccino which paired nicely with dessert. . The service was great - friendly and attentive. . We will definitely return soon.","Been here a few times. Sometimes just for a pint to watch a game and sometimes for a few pints and some food. Used to like the cassoulet but that is no longer on the menu so have been sticking with the flatbread pizza. Ventured away from that recently and was extremely disappointed. I ordered the beef dip. You know you are in trouble when you bite into a sandwich and you cannot bit through it. Beef was mainly fat and gristle. Bread they used was good, as were the fries. When I showed the waitress the \"beef\" she offered to delete the charge. . Go for the flatbread and the beer. Go next door to Hy's if you are looking for a roast beef sandwich.","I came in to the restaurant at 4:30pm. It was mostly empty, however the service was slow and inattentive. . I ordered the clam pizza and am sorry I did. The only clams on the pizza were 1-2 still in the shell on each slice. You had to scrape them out yourself. I would rather eat my pizza rather than work for it. Furthermore, this resulted in very little crab meat on the pizza. Lastly, there were clam shells broken off and melted into the pizza. They were hard to see. Thus, there were 2-3 bites I literally has to spit out as I was chewing clam shells. . When I pointed this out to the waitress Amanda she said sorry and she would tell the chef. She even admitted that this was not the first time this has happened. Despite my complaint there was not an offer to deduct a portion of the bill or offer of free dessert or something to compensate. . Disappointing.","Amazing food and very nice staff! This is my 4th time here and I love the food. Their pizzas aro very yummy!! I ordered 14\" thin crust pizza and it was delicious; they always put just enough toppings and not too much sauce. Their pasta is amazing as well; last time I ordered Egplant Parmesan and was very tasty! I will definitely recommend the place.","Went to this place last night for dinner and I was impressed. They had both indoor and outdoor door seating both having a great atmosphere. The outdoor was on a side street patio and was more roomy than typical urban outdoor venues. Inside had nice decor. . The food was delicious. We got a prosciutto Margarita pizza with mixed berry mojitos. . The mojito was interesting tasting with a fizzy soda taste,  but the fresh fruits added great flavor. . The pizza was great,  flavorful,  crispy but soft on the side. . . It's that perfect equilibrium for brick oven. . . And this is coming from a kid that eats NJ pizza everyday. . . I was a bit scared because of the difference in water,  but bevo gets it right. . . The service,  the atmosphere and the food make this place a must go to.","If you are looking for great, fast pizza at a reasonable price, look no farther. Wonderful wood-fired deliciousness. They have other items available, as well. But all we have ever had is the pizza.","A different kind of pizza, which is refreshing in the Valley. I also enjoy the bar setup, it's a good place to have a drink on a nice day. UPDATE: This is one of my favorite places in the Valley, both the Desert Ridge and Hilton Village locations. All day Happy Hour, kids eat free on Sunday, very fun and friendly staff! Tell a friend.","My family has made a goal to try something new here every time we come. So far, that's been really easy. They have so many #pizza options. Great lunch specials. And DELICIOUS pizza #cookies. Good place just to come for #dessert. Try the #fried zucchini, you won't regret it.","Just got delivery from here and wtf. . . ordered the half sheet pizza and at some point it was evidently sideways from there to here. We got 2 toppings on one side, 2 on the other and when we opened it, about 1/4 of the pizza was \"mine\" as the other ingredients had slid over. This in itself might not be a problem - I could maybe give it an \"eh, whatever, \" but then in taking 2 bites, I knew that for how greasy the pizza was, if I ate it my digestive system would be in for a cleansing if you know what I mean. . I called them back and said I wanted my credit card refunded. She had to call the owner. The driver promptly came back with a \"Transaction Voided\" receipt and I was told that the amount would be credited to my account within 2-3 business days. Oh, and incidentally, they even asked us to return the 2 liter of soda - so we had to pour it back into the bottle from our glasses. I should have said I was keeping it for the inconvenience, but you know, whatever. . Needless to say I will NOT be ordering from Nunzio's again.","Alright, here comes a big one . I have been to Arizonas many times. Mainly because it's close to home, plays the hockey games or UFC fights on big enough screens, and has good food . This is a two part review. Good things:. The food at Arizonas is always tasty and the menu is HUGE so there's surely something for everyone. I recommend the pizzas, the half price apps, or the wings. . The atmosphere during a game is great cause a lot of people are there to watch so it has a sports-bar excitement about it. There are a lot of TVs, you will see no matter where you sit . Bad things:. Service is never great. I feel like they hire pretty girls who don't really feel they have to work at their best to serve customers. I've found most people seem annoyed or unfriendly when asked things and seem preoccupied and like they don't have the time for you. The service while they're busy is even worse- this time even effecting food prep (we came on a busy night once and my bruschetta (picture posted) was SOOO skimpy and not worth the money) . The sound boxes that you can ask for at your table so you can hear the game/fight on tv sometimes don't play the right channel and no one seems to care to help no matter how much you ask. The atmosphere on weekend NIGHTS turns dark and loud with beats blaring- almost like a club- which is very annoying on a night where the place ADVERTISED they were playing the UFC fight (I'm just saying) . Aoo I mean, good food, I go a lot, but sometimes it's really shit. Service is the biggest problem id say. And volume of the music when half the people in the place aren't there for that- they're there to watch a sporting event","So we ended up here right before a concert when we were STARVED and had minimum time to eat. The place was pretty empty around 7p and the prices seemed a tad high for a \"cafe\" but we didn't have much of a choice. . We got 2 pasta dishes, the prosciutto pizza and the pork belly nachos for 4 people. The pizza flavors were SO good - I only wish there was more prosciutto. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the pork belly nachos. . . . OMG I wish I had saved much much more room for those. . . they were SO good. . The drinks were also very good, although I think a bit light on the alcohol. . . . Overall, a solid choice for dinner - the ambiance is really nice despite the fact that it's called a cafe, the food portions were solid but not overwhelming and the food itself was great.","We ordered from this place last Friday because we got an ad on our door saying they deliver BEER!!! Was trying to stay in that night and Gus's Pizza made that possible. . We moved here from Chicago and have had plenty of pizza in NYC over the years and I honestly don't understand the negative reviews about this place. Maybe the staff saw how the company was being looked at on here and made some changes, I say that because we were very impressed. . We ordered a large pizza with bacon and pep, along with a order of Garlic Knots and a 6 pack of Bud. . The guy on the phone was very polite and made sure he got our order correct, he said it would be 45mins to an hour, expected for a Friday night. . 35mins later our pizza and beer shows up. The delivery guy was a little off, maybe had a \"pick me up\" to get through his shift, but needless to say, he did his job in a timely matter. . The pizza was amazing!!! Hot, Fresh, Good Crust. I never eat crust, and I killed this crust. Yeah, Clean plate club over here. It even heats up well. . Most of the reviews are not good, but we tried this place before even reading a review and we loved it. I say, give it another shot. . Oh yeah, 24hr delivery.","The seating is s little scatter brained in the area but the pizza is great and the service was exceptional. . Definitely would like to return and try the s'mores dessert they have. Looked like a hot commodity the night we went.","We like the white pizza  the pizza is good. Salads are small. People are nice. We plan to use them again","Really love this Barro's! The staff is always very friendly and efficient, the pizza is always great. . . they are never stingy with the cheese or toppings. Plus the location is right next to my neighborhood, so it makes it super easy to stop by on our way home.","Stopped in to get some snacks on our way to a softball game and spent about 15 bucks. I used my debit card and asked for 40 back because I needed some cash for next day. The  attendant started to tell me that I had to notify her prior to getting cash back and proceeded to tell me that I had to inform her that I want cash back due to them having limited cash. For the weekend. If that is true then don't offer cash back and my slices of pizza was nasty maybe I'll be back but I will always get cash back with out notice just to piss you off","This was our 1st time to an Oregano's restaurant. If you go at dinner time expect at least a 45 to 60 minute wait. However there is seating outside for the wait to get in and they call your name when the table is ready. We waited almost an hour on a Tuesday. . There are 3 different kinds of pizza crust, deep dish, pan and thin, I wanted to get the pan or deep dish, but the hubby always wants thin crust. And boy of boy, this thin crust is super thin, thinner than a tortilla, so being that way of course the toppings are few. . As for taste wise and portions it was very good, and large. . Now the best things here are the salads!! Superb!!  We shared with friends 2 kinds, the Oregano's salad which had pine nuts, roasted red peppers, raisins, onions and more with an Italian dressing, Awesome, I couldn't stop eating it. The other salad was a funny name that I cannot remember, but it had grilled chicken, tortilla strips, corn, black beans and an awesome dressing, it was the bomb!. And last, you MUST get the warm cookie topped with Ice Cream, holy moly 2 of us shared this and I could have eaten 1 all to myself. We had the Macadamia Nut, totally out of this world, warm gooey and wonderful! I know Chocolate Chip is also a choice. . The service was great, the hostess kept you informed on how long you would be waiting and how many more were in front of you. . The server was one of the best, very on top of everything and very informative, (he was also really cute), he kept our drinks full and cleared our empty dishes right away, and then boxed up our leftovers for us. . I will go back the next time I am here in the valley for sure, but I will make my hubby try the pan crust pizza!","Any place I visit for the first time with fellow yelpers always seems better than without them. Case in point: Old Angle, Primo Vino, Prosperity. I probably wouldn't have gone gaga for those places like I did without my peeps. So having a mini Yelp thing made XYZ very fun. Great view of the spanking new streetscape( unlike the Overrated Dog down the street). Solid tap list, cheaper than Tremont. . Phenomenal pizza! You don't even understand. For 14 bucks we expected a pie the size of a coaster. It was huge, Angelo's- esque in quality and was fun to share among friends. Other reviews say to avoid the za. I don't know, you must have gone on a bad night. Service was good on a slow Wednesday night. Not sure how they fare on the weekend. . Weakest point was the juke. Horrific. For a place so fresh and modern, the jukebox seemed like it had been bought from an old man bar. Or even worse, a college town. It was slim pickings if you didn't feel like hearing the Eagles or Willie Nelson. Parking was ample and close. You lose again, Tremont.","The eatery is very well put together and comfortable. The design and decoration make this place so cute. He staff was friendly and helpful. The outside area was amazing. The view was relaxing and the shaded patio gave us a place to sit and relax. . The food, on the other hand, was not great. I got a \"blackened broccoli salad\" which was not blackened, it was browned and soggy. My husband got a pepperoni pizza which was extremely greasy. The cheese was so strange, it had absolutely zero flavor. The pepperoni was tasty though. He whole thing was thin and soggy as well. . It's a bummer, I was really hoping the food would be as good as the cafe looks, but not so much. I won't return soon.","We used to order from Caliente's a lot. We always thought their delivery was spot on and we even liked to pick up our orders and grab a beer while we waited. The food has always been good. I loveeee their pizza sauce, especially with banana peppers and sausage. . I have a few qualms, though, and I feel like they can be pretty easy fixes (maybe). . 1. I used to always order buffalo shrimp salad and they were always out of the buffalo shrimp so I had to settle for buffalo chicken -_-. I've since stopped ordering it, so I'm not sure if that ever panned out. . 2. I have had multiple occasions where we will order something, go to pick it up, and it's not ready - not only is it not ready, they haven't even started to make it. One time, I ordered pick up, and they . . . delivered it (they already had my address on file, lol oops). . 3. The service is hit or miss. I do love sitting at the bar though, they are very attentive. . 4. This is such a privileged thing to complain about and I'm so sorry, but if you order a pepperoni pizza, you better really love pepperoni because the whole pizza will be COVERED in pepperoni. It leaves it very greasy but admittedly, pretty tasty. . Again, I love Caliente's food. . . there are just little things that I think we should all be aware of :)","It's a family-run business. Friendly service and delicious pizza. As mentioned by another yelper, their pies are not greasy. Will definitely be back. . *I'm deducting 1 star off for the wings; they're your garden variety frozen wings that are baked in the pizza oven when you place your order. It's soggy and not crispy. But then again, it's kinda my fault ordering wings at the neighbourhood pizza shop, i shoulda just stuck with ordering pizzas only.","Pretty good pizza. Located in a strip mall next to various other shops like a chiro massage place and a pub. Place is clean for the most part. There was a water leak on the roof that kept dripping while I waited for our pizza to get done and a unusual gas odor. Lots of choices of to go items from pizzas to calzones. Weirdly enough was that they didn't have free prepackaged condiments such as: Parmesan cheese, dry herbs (oregano, basil, and thyme), or crushed red chili pepper. It was just in several individual shakers. Interesting topping was organic pepperoni we don't have that in the states.","Mom and I sat in the patio on a beautiful Friday. Our server was awesome and very knowledgeable. We decided to order a little bit of everything to try things out: the Farm Greens salad, a large, lovely variety of greens, herbs, shaved carrots/radishes/cukes with a light balsamic dressing - YUM. The Pasta Pomodoro - a medium sized portion of delicious, housemade pasta with a 100% fresh tomato sauce (fresh from the garden tomatoes!), and the white pizza - which was KILLER. The crust was light and chewy, the ricotta they used was silky smooth - honestly the best white pizza I've ever had. Lastly, we shared a latte which was smooth and creamy with a full bodied foam on top. We LOVED everything about this restaurant. So why only 4 stars? The price. I'm a foodie. And this place was delicious. But $14 for pasta/tomatoes? Ouch. It might serve the owners well to create a lunch menu with lunch menu pricing.","I was very excited by the menu at Chaz &amp; Odette's, but the whole experience was extremely disappointing. They originally got our reservation wrong, but we were thankfully seated anyway. Service was very slow, from our waiter who was difficult to find to the *very* backed up kitchen (despite being one of the first tables there). We ordered the lamb meatballs and brussels sprouts for appetizers. The meatballs were luke warm, though the flavor was nice. The sprouts were tasty and probably were my favorite dish of the evening. . We then waited almost an hour to get our entrees. The brisket mac and cheese was very disappointing. We had three small pieces of brisket with bland mac and cheese. The collards served with it were completely unseasoned. I cannot believe they charged $24 for such a small, bland portion. The apricot goat cheese pizza was tasty, but the toppings were very sparse. Each bite was mostly just dough. The burger was overdone, and the accompanying fries were burnt and honestly the worst fries I've ever had. The chicken wings and waffles were cold, which is not surprising given how long we waited to be served. . Everything was just uninspiring, cold, and not well-seasoned.","Kinda disappointing. It was a late night pick and kinda wanted to send it back. The veggies and meats on pizza was delicious but the crust seem pre-made and the cheese and sauce had no flavor.","Pretty decent Italian food. What mostly drew us in were the softball sized arancini. While delicious and flavorful, I would like to try one of these made with the risotto rice rather than the plain white rice. The mozzarella poutine was delicious and pizza was flavorful and had plentiful toppings. Definitely happy I tried this and it was soooo filling!","As a person who loves Downtown, but has yet to discover all the delicious wonders it has strewn throughout, I enjoyed this new place. One, I love the name. \"Red Moon\" is something that catches my attention right off the bat. They have a little bar at the front and the dining area is pretty big, but not too big. You need a code to get into the restrooms, which I find very safe. Downtown folks and bathrooms can get a little crazy sometimes, so I appreciate the thought from the owner(s). . As for the food, quite delicious. We had their Capri salad, lasagna, Margarita pizza, and just a simple sausage and pepperoni pizza. All that was perfect for four of us. The Margarita pizza was my favorite. The lasagna was pretty darn good too, but I have had better. . The only thing that was not perfect, though he was very very nice, was the inattentiveness of the waiter. It took him awhile to realize we needed more drinks and to come check in on us. . Other than that, everything was very nice and delicious!","Great place for wine and pizza!! They even have a vegan pizza!! It is so hard to find a place with vegan cheese and sausage. Love going there for happy hour. The outside seating is awesome too.","This is pretty bad pizza. We ordered because it could be delivered to hotel  . . . tastes like cardboard very light on toppings. . . I would never order again. I think it might be frozen Digorno. The salads were lettuce w three tomato slices. . some of lettuce was turning.","Ate here yesterday as a group of 10 after we hiked at Red Rock. I'm not sure if any of us had been there before, but our cars were parked in the lot and we were a bit hungry so we voted between this place and In-N-Out and pizza prevailed. We were seated right away by the kitchen around 3 ish. . I don't know about you, but I HATE splitting things as a group. The group wanted to order three large pizzas to split between us along with garlic bread. Ugh, I always feel like I'm going to have to throw down $10 for two slices or some other nonsense. I decided to opt out of the pizza and garlic bread sharing (and bill splitting) by ordering an Italian beef sandwich and fries that came with au jus (hence the reason I ordered it) and jardinere for $6. 99. The fries were thick and gave them to a guy at our table and I ate the sandwich. It was filled with a ton of meat, but I wish there had been a bit more aus jus and jardinere. It was really yummy and I'd for sure order it again, subbing onion rings for an extra charge, though. . Apparently the pizzas and garlic bread (half with cheese, half not) was really good, according to the rest of the group. One of my friends from Jersey also opted out of the pizza sharing and got the $5. 65 two slices of cheese pizza and a sprite and she said it was ok. . The place is covered by family photos and the owner (or I assumed he was the owner) told us who the various people were on the wall.","This is THE best pizza I have ever had ! The crust it with out a doubt the best! Light and fluffy and crisp on the bottom! I ordered a cheese, pepperoni and a veggie pizza. Even my one year old was ripping pizza ! She loved it ! Adrian and his wife  made it feel spot on with the hospitable service. We will defiantly be back when we're in town again! We're from Las Vegas &amp; come to Scottsdale a lot &amp; stumbled across this place shopping. What a great find! MUST TRY!","I love the individual pizzas but the macaroni and cheese is beyond TO DIE FOR.  The best I have had in my life.","This review is based my latest experience. I have always ordered from Magura, mostly satisfied with my orders. I ordered Hawaiian pizza with bell peppers and fingers. Now Magura is a little over 5 minutes away. I used the Eat24 app to place order at 1624 and was supposed to arrive at 1708. The food arrived 15 minutes later. So it took 10 minutes to cook the food. Doesn't pizza take longer to cook? The bell peppers were missing from the pizza. It must  have been pre-made. The fingers were greasy and tasted weird. I should have taken a picture. The fries were good. Had to throw the fingers out. Won't be ordering from there for a while.","This is a must have in old town, the pizza here is amazing, light, crispy, and fresh! While the pizza was cooking we met the  family who owns Crisp, they are wonderful people who have been living in the valley for over four years now after moving from New York. Support your neighbors while enjoying a delicious pie!!","I was hungry aftr watchin zarkana show n this was nearby. . saw this place was open. . . wanted to try a slice of pizza. . was told if i sit at bar they have limited menu for slices. . if u dine in restaurant area gotta order whole pizza. . . i got a seat at bar. . friendly bartendress gave me a menu n got my order. . i tried the forager which consists of white sauce, spinach, whipped ricotta n mushrooms. . it was delicious! Washed it down with a pepsi. . i was satisfied. . . i will be back!","Sauce is just my pace. It's a relaxed atmosphere where you order the food from a counter and it is brought to your table when it is ready. They offer pizza, tasty salads, panini's, and pastas. I have only tried the pizza and salads, but I have been very happy with both. They also have a huge selection of wines to choose from. . The pizzas do somewhat remind me of Italian pizza, just a crisper crust. They have some very unique pizza flavors at Sauce. Last time I ate there we tried the  Rosemary potato, spinach, feta, and olive pizza. I was a bit hesitant about the potatoes, but it turned out to be really good. . I have to admit Sauce was a bit over hyped, but still the food is good and I really like the relaxed atmosphere!","Great place for kids. Laid back atmosphere which we loved, yet still hip and cool. Food was delicious! I felt like I was in Europe when we tasted the food. We ordered 4 pizzas all yummy (no we are not total pigs, the pizzas are individual sizes) , and we also had delicious arugula and prosciutto salad; which was heavenly. What i liked is that their menu is big enough to keep you coming back to try different things.","The best pizza I've ever tried in my life!!!! After you have a few bites, you don't wanna stop it, you just feel like to keep eating. I would love to go back again :D!!","Excellent Service. ASK FOR MEAGAN!!! The pizza was great. I recommend the Caesar salad with salami and mozzarella. We had The Don pizza and it was awesome.","Great patio and pizza located on a cute side street in downtown Montreal. They had good beer on tap and yummy sangria! Service was excellent with a relaxed atmosphere.","Ordered and picked up two pizza's tonight, asked for extra sauce on them. No extra sauce on either and didn't get much cheese on one of them that was suppose to be half cheese half sausage. Called and spoke to Saba the manager and he said it was my fault for ordering extra sauce, \"the cheese sucked up the sauce\". What?! Refused to replace. Never had this problem before. Not worth $45 I spent for two pizza's.","So yeah, I'm reviewing a chain. I wanted to try the \"new and improved\" Domino's Pizza. Everything those commercials said about their old pizza was true-- cardboard crust, ketchup sauce, bad toppings. So, is the new Domino's better than the old? . Yes, but that's not saying much-- it moves up from negative stars to 1, perhaps1. 5 stars. The cheese and toppings are much improved. The cheese abundant and tasty and the mushrooms were thickly sliced whole brown mushrooms. Really good. The sauce was a bit salty and bland-- not horrible, but nothing to write home about. . They still have a problem with the crust. The crust on both mediums we ordered was mushy and underdone. While it wasn't as blatantly offensive as old Domino's crust, it still had a lingering aftertaste like those Bisquick pancakes mom used to try to feed us in the 1970s. Add to that an abundant dusting of garlic salt and you've got a taste reminiscent of your first boyfriend's attempt to make you an \"Italian\" dinner with garlic bread. I had no idea they even made garlic salt any more. It hasn't improved. . So, the pizza has improved, but not enough for me to ever eat it again.","We had the bone in wings mild and a deep dish pizza. Sooooo good! The server was very nice and friendly. We will make this a regular stop.","The pizza was amazing. We were so surprised how good it was. We ordered in one night at the hotel boy I'm glad we did. My wife got a salad and that was also good.","Guys is my absolute favorite pizza in Cleveland. It's also one of the only places to get late night food because apparently the Eastside has an aversion to eating after 11 pm or something (driving me crazy on the reg). . I'm a big fan of getting their giant New Yorker pizza and I have absolutely no justification for that. I eat one piece and I'm stuffed, but it's just so big that it barely fits in the car and I kinda think it's funny (maybe that's why I just can't help myself). . I'm also a big fan of the pizza by the slice. There's usually no wait and it's cheap. . Another great tidbit is that you can save the little coupons on the box lids and once you get 10, you get a free pizza!","I love this place. I get take out a few times a month since I work close. They have great pizza, great salads, and the bartenders are super awesome. The pizza is a little pricy but totally worth it. 5 stars.","I normally order pizza from this location on a regular basis. I would carry out but this was my 1st time having it delivered. . . I completed my order at 7:00 it was confirmed on the delivery tracking that the order would be delivered at 7:37 well I did not get my order until 8:15. Almost 40 mins after the tracker staled that I would have my food. The pizza was cold and my wings were under cooked. I called the establishment and was told I could get a free pizza :( the manager stated that she would used this as a coaching opportunity for her drivers. Honestly that is not my issue. It will be a while before I return here.","Hmmm. Not sure how to rate them. The bedded duck pizza was a bit salty (they used feta instead of the advertised goat cheese). I liked the spinach artichoke dip, and the turducken burger was pretty good. My dessert was supposed to be a fresh fruit trifle, but it was nothing special since it was just yogurt and blueberries. The decor was nice. Service was so-so. I had a bite of darren's cheesecake, and it was really good. BZ's is just a little inconsistent.","Seriously the worst service I have ever got in my life . We called in to order a pizza and the kid on the phone couldn't even figure out how to take my order then I told them 3 different times we had cash and to please bring change for it . You think they brought change ? Nope they tried to give us change back as if we were tipping the kid 20$ for the delivery . 3 timesssss I told them . Horrible cold pizza too I will never eat with Pizza Hut ever again . Ever!!!","Pizza by Robert is awesome! We eat here probably once every two weeks and haven't been disappointed by anything yet!  The pizza is made with awesome ingredients and is just so good. Prices are pretty good and they always have a coupon for something. Definitely worth checking out!","We stopped in here on our way home from the Glendale Glitter and Glow Block Party. It was 9:00 and there were about 12-15 other people there (one large group and one smaller group). The large group seemed to be a group of \"regulars\" so we thought that was a really good sign!. The bread with the red pimiento dipping sauce was good - my husband loved the dip and we quickly needed a second dip. We started by sharing  the hot antipasti special. The eggplant rolatini and the stuffed mushrooms were very good. . For a main course, my husband had the South Beach pizza which had mozzarella, goat cheese, mushrooms, spinach, peppers. I wasn't in the mood for pizza or salad, and the entree menu is not that extensive. I decided the chicken &amp; shrimp carbonara pasta as I liked the sound of the ingredients but didn't really want a cream sauce. The chef instead used all the same ingredients but cooked it in olive oil and garlic. There was a lot of garlic, but it was very good. . As the other two reviewers said, the portion sizes are very large and we both brought home left-overs. . The waitresses were very nice and friendly and even thanked us by name (from the credit card) when we left. . Overall, I thought the food was good value and would definitely stop in here again.","Ordered catering for a family event. We had a gathering at the house after a funeral. We ordered a few sheet pizzas, penne pasta and meatballs, garlic knots, house salad, and a mixed sandwich platter. All items were fine except the sandwich platter. So much so that we took the platter back to the store to discuss our dissatisfaction. . The bread was VERY DRY, shredded cheese (on a sandwich?), limited meat, at first I thought no vegetables but later I was told there was a few slivers of lettuce, condiments only consisted of mayonnaise, and there was to be a variety of 5 different sandwiches but in the end we only received 3. You can see from the photo that our guests did not find the sandwiches appetizing as the plate contains 28 sandwiches and only 11 were consumed. Of those consumed most were left on their plates to be thrown out. . The gentleman we spoke to quickly got on the defensive when we tried to express our displeasure. He made such remarks of \"Nobody has ever complained about it\"  \"Our bread is good\"  \"I eat them every day and there is nothing wrong with them\". He invalidated our complaint and instead of trying to understand why we went out of our way, on a day of family mourning to addresses this, he acted put out and offended by our desire for a refund.  . This was a $60. 00 platter. You look at the photos and decide if this is what you would expect and then consider before your next dining at Zeppe's is this the type of customer service you want?. At first we were only offered a in store credit of $20. This was a $181 order. In the end we received a $40 credit but why did we have to go through this in the first place? Give us a good product and there would not have been the need to address this.","Went in for lunch, looked good so I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza, and some garlic Parmesan fries. They burned the pizza and under cooked the fries. But to top it off, the order came to $10. 27(pricy but whatever its vegas), and I gave them a dollar tip (wrote on the reciet and even totaled it out for them). When I went to check my bank account, they charged me $12. 32. . . I hate to be anal about one dollar, but they did not deserve it and it was blindly taken from me, from right under my nose. The woman cashier was nice but the gentleman cook seemed like an asshole and gave me a sassy look when I asked for a side of ranch. No mention of the ranch costing extra or anything. . I would of paid for it. . Assuming it cost a dollar. . I guess I did pay for it. Whatever, last time I visit them.","Delicious NY style pizza!. We spent some time at Red Rock Canyon, and this nearby spot was the perfect place for a quick bite. . We were skeptical about the place, but the crust was thin with a bit of crispiness. The cheese was nice and melty.  . The meatballs appetizer was good enough, though it was very standard. The meatball was soft. . Our waitress was friendly and gave us some tips on local places to visit. I'm pretty sure the owner is from New York, so he knows what's up.","Great pizza and food. Atmosphere is awesome. True chicago style pizza resembles a lot like giordanos east in Chicago. Must go","For a reasonably priced Asian Buffet, Krazy Buffet is the place to visit. Avoid the early morning rush around 11:30am-12pm on Saturday's as wait times can get as long as up to 30 min to an hour! Food taste wise is alright, not the greatest but hey, you get what you pay for right? Although I do admit the selection of food is pretty good from sushi, to chinese, to pizza? Large dessert section too to keep the little ones, and adults happy. :)","Super Pizza is a great mom and pop pizza shop! The people are super nice, very welcoming and the pizza is delicious! Pizza is slightly greasy but what pizza isn't! Great go-to pizza joint if your not down with the cookie cutter pizza shops! Say no to Pizza Hut and yes to Super Pizza.","I'm not really sure why overall this place has bad reviews on yelp. I order from them some what often and I'm always satisfied. It's super cheap and really good. I don't like heavy seasoning and oils so this is a pizza place that doesn't make you want to roll over and die after. They always take an hour to deliver no matter what time I call. Worth the hour wait especially for the price. Only negative thing I have to say is usually the girl who answers the phone isn't very friendly and sometimes acts like it's an inconvenience to her. . . only reason I didn't give them a five star","Best pizza in town, in my opinion!! Small, clean retro restaurant, but nice atmosphere. Really good Caesar Salad. We usually have the Chicken Hawaiian pizza because it's not very salty at all and it's delicious! Crust is excellent, too. Every time I go, I say I'm going to try something different, but the pizza is so darn good, I give in and end up having it every time! Service is always friendly and efficient. Kelly usually serves us and she's such a sweetheart! And a fantastic server! From my experience, the price is average and comparable to other pizza places. . If you want an excellent pizza, I'm pretty sure The Place won't disappoint!","I was feeling lazy after orchestra rehearsal on Sunday evening, so I decided to try Pizza Break. There were a few ongoing specials. The takeout special was $10 for a large pizza with 3 toppings. I decided on mushrooms, chicken, and Italian sausage for the toppings. 20 minutes later and it's ready for pick up. It's in the same plaza as Ay Caramba, so it was easy to find. The restaurant is pretty small with only a few tables. It's definitely a take out joint. . When I took a bite into the first slice of pizza, I could taste the freshness of the ingredients. The fresh tomato sauce really popped out the most. The crust was crunchy on the outside yet with a slight softness on the inside. I'd definitely come back.","The margherita pizza itself was about 3. 5 stars, but the quick service and low prices make this a four star restaurant for me. I look forward to trying the wings and additional specialty pizzas on my next trip.","Enjoyed this place. Nice inviting atmosphere. Friendly and professional wait staff and bartender. Negroni and citrusy mocktail were excellent. Had the bucatini , Margherita pizza, and Caesar salad. All ingredients were fresh tasting and the preparation was perfect. Parking was easy. Would definitely return.","Got the garlic Parmesan wings at the request of my girlfriend but wasn't disappointed. Had the pizza for the main course. Pretty plain Jane with the pepperoni but it was delicious. The crust is flaky yet full and I'm not typically a crust guy. Great overall meal and was happy they had some Four Peaks on draft to wash it all down.","One star because I can't tell you if the pizza is any good because every time I call they put me on hold. First time 10min so figured they forgot I was on hold. So Hung up &amp;  called back when they asked if they could put me on hold I said no &amp;  they put me on hold anyway.","Despite poor reviews, this is still 1 of 2 bars showing WWE (the other in Mesa). I was impressed w the number of tvs bc they're everywhere even with sound outside. . First experience: Service was a little slow. Not enough staff, but those here were working hard. I waited between beverages which is a negative. Food wasn't good. We got traditional fries that were not all the way cooked, drenched in oil, soggy/flimsy. They came w ketchup and 2 sauces. We picked house made garlic aioli and chipotle. Big mistake on anything made in house. See THE BEST For more on sauces. . Next several experiences: pizza-thumbs down. Reuben (why did I order Irish fare here) had processed Swiss singles but crispy corn beef, tasty thousand island and dry sour kraut on well toasted marble rye. Pickle was the highlight but fries have seriously improved. Burger-just okay. Cooked as ordered. Bacon was extra crispy and again the highlight. . Earlier last year and this year (2014) There was a special menu for the WWE event which did feature a cheeseburger and fries for $7. 99. There were healthy and vegetarian options with the most expensive item being $13. 99. . Now there's a very reasonable regular menu and no gratuity on PPV nights. . The menu pricing seems strange. Some items are $2, $3, $10, while others are $8. 98, $5. 50, $7. 59, or $0. 95. . How do you get the beers so cold? I watched the bar tender pull the mugs, already full of beer from the cooler. Then she topped them off to give a head. Creepy or ingenious? UPDATE: haven't seen that since summer. Beers are still cold and bar staff is tops. They're on it, at least the awesome blonde behind the bar. . If I lived nearby I could see this as a more regular place. Definitely live no cover for PPV. . THE BEST: they are masters of sauce. . . ranch, pepper, all kinds. Give it a go.","I have been going to Oregano's since I was kid, and there has been no place that tops this restaurant. My family and I would drive an hour just to eat here before they opened the Glendale location. They have creative and diverse Italian options to suit everyone, and they're old-style decor really sets the atmosphere of the restaurant. I have never had bad service or bad food from this establishment, and I eat here more than any other restaurant in town. . PS: The pizza cookie is a MUST HAVE!","Awesome place. I will order wings and pizza from here rather than Native. Yumm! Meat lovers pizza was the bomb. . Honey hot wings were delicious.","My only choice for late night pizza, the place is always busy and the pizza is always fresh, well except the slices (only sometimes). The manager also seems to have a very specific hiring policy when it comes to the cashiers.","For a quick and easy pizza, it's hard to go wrong. This is the Chipotle of pizza. It sounds crazy in concept, especially given how long pizza generally takes, but the value is pretty solid for the amount of food you receive (12'' pizza typically costs about $8. 50 or so). . If you want an authentic pizza I'd look elsewhere, but for some good date-night-in-the-house food you don't need to look too much further.","I am so glad one of my co-workers discovered this place! We have ordered a couple of times and have not been disappointed. The first time we ordered, only one of us got pizza. She raved about how good it was (and she is from Chicago). They did forget the fries on one of the orders but quickly sent out another batch to us. The second time we ordered, three of us got pizza and we all agree that is awesome. Lots of topping, even on a one topping order. Light on the sauce, nice thin and crispy crust. Only downside was one of the pizza had a wrong topping than what was ordered. it was still very tasty but that along with forgetting the fries the first time is why this was only a 4 star rating. Good prices, quick delivery. We will be ordering from here again","Wow! We ordered a thin crust and deep dish. Both were so good. Deep dish is totally worth the wait. . We arrived about and hour and half before closing on a Sunday night. Great time to go- no wait to be seated and it cut down on the time to bake our pizza.","Best pizza take out / delivery in the east end; not the quickest, but the highest quality. Great pizza and fries. Falafel was decent too.","Fantastic pizza. They sell their own dough, so that's a plus! . Great NY feel and service is always great with plenty of seating along the aisle, back and outside. Love the samples near the register as well.","If you think this is good pizza, you need to get out more. I tried two kinds: the bronze dragon and the breakfast pizza. I honestly couldn't tell you which was supposed to be which. Maybe it was because the line was long, but the crust was underdone and too doughy, and the sausage, which was on both pizzas, was still pink. I'm not from the Midwest and I have yet to find pizza that even comes close to what I'm used to in PA/NJ/NY.","My pick of the seemingly dozens of pizza shops in Squirrel Hill. Not as greasy as its rival, Mineo's, down the street. I usually just get slices, but their Farmer's Pizza (with mashed potatoes and corn) is definitely worth trying. A good place for a quick lunch, and it's open late, too!","Fantastic pizza and pasta. One of the best I've ever tried. The dishes had a nice meat to pasta/pizza ratio. You can also tell their ingredients are top notch (literally the smell of freshness hits you as you walk into the door). . The service was also second to none. As others have noted, one of the owners came by to make sure all was well and even offered a small treat for our little one. . Highly recommend the Peking duck pizza and any of the pastas. . We will definitely be back again.","Love love love this place. Biggest Calzones I've ever had. Fast delivery. Great taste. We also tried the apple pie sticks and they're so yum! They put apple pie filling inside a pizza dough and sprinkle with cinnamon. So good!","Really good pizza. Crust was a little too burnt for me, but they burn all their pizzas on purpose. Wings have no sauce and taste great.","Ordered carryout, 2 medium pizzas, it was ready in about 15 minutes. Restaurant was clean, employees were all hard at work and friendly. The manager showed me the pizzas and they were exactly as ordered. Pizzas we're great thanks.","I love this place. The pizza is awesome. Portions are large. Order the cheese bread and it will make your eyes pop and mouth water, but keep room for the entree. Servers are friendly and this place is always hopping as it is popular lunch and dinner destination. Very kid friendly. Best pizza in AZ.  We will be back.","We maybe shouldn't have gone when Hey! was quite so new. We were there on September 29th, and I think they were still ironing out some pretty significant wrinkles.  . I think the menu is ever-changing, but on this particular day, I had a spaghetti with meat sauce, which I quite enjoyed. My husband however, ordered a pizza, and it was TEENSY TINY.  It was maybe 8\" in diameter, and while he did love the taste, it wasn't really a practical serving size. Luckily, he had ordered a soup as a starter - however that was served just barely warm. We watched the table beside us order it later in the evening, and saw that it was delivered steaming hot. So perhaps we should have spoken up. However, it was rare that a server visited our table. We felt like we were often forgotten about. . My husband wanted red wine with his pizza, but we were told they didn't yet have red wine (they hadn't received the shipment). They had ros\u00e9, but that wasn't going to cut it. We couldn't help but wonder why they wouldn't have just bought a few cases at the local LCBO?   I don't understand how restaurant liquor licences work, but there must have been an option?  . We then ordered dessert (some sort of cake, I can't remember now what it was), and I, being pregnant, thought a decaf latte might have been nice with it. But, we were told the decaf coffee hadn't come in yet. Again. . . . wondering why they couldn't improvise by running up to Starbucks and buying a few pounds of decaf?  . The atmosphere was cozy and comfortable, with a real \"at home\" feel to it. Lots of kids, very family-friendly. But the service is a definite area for improvement. Food seems to be hit and miss so far. And our receipt was hand-written. So like I said, maybe we just went to early. . I want to like this place!  I love to see great success on Roncesvalles. C'mon Rodney Bowers, show us what you're made of!","I was in town for the weekend from Washington, DC to celebrate my friend's 30th birthday. We had dinner here before heading out for a night of celebration - I opted for the beef short rib. . While eating, I was less than impressed with the flavor profile. I thought maybe it was because I am spoiled by the DC restaurant scene - I only completed half of the meal. Within an hour of consuming the meal, I realized I had food poisoning. I was violently ill for the next eight hours, had to pass on celebrating my friend's birthday that I came into town for and instead spent it with my head in the toilet. . It is interesting to read some of the other reviews stating that Lago has a very high amount of health code violations - not surprised. . Additionally, my friend's husband had a pizza with some of the same meat on it (much smaller amount than my meal). He suffered from some of the same symptoms on a less severe level as mine. . Just my experience, eat at your own risk. . B. PS, here are all of the health code violations (click right, there are over 30): http://www. cleveland. com/datacentral/index. ssf/2016/07/find_ohio_restaurant_inspectio. html?appSession=16012723090076720557387043116441873242689634337233748355385623392227642717882018813140842838815487639001555215132924799686270628&amp;RecordID=22882&amp;PageID=8&amp;PrevPageID=2&amp;cpipage=1&amp;CPIsortType=&amp;CPIorderBy=&amp;cbCurrentRecordPosition=15&amp;Mod0LinkToDetails=True","Stopped in for a slice of some thin crust New York style pizza. Nice coal brick oven pizza with fresh mozzarella and spicy sausage. Thge service was outstanding, and the atmosphere was reminiscent of the Rat Pack. Nice lunch date!","I had the pizza + pasta combo, with fettuccine alfredo and spinach + mushroom on my pizza. The pasta was pretty average, as well as the pizza. But our server showed true customer service and that's the reason I'm really writing the review. His name is Eric, and he was so friendly and calm, it just made you feel comfortable and relaxed during the duration of your meal. (My friend made a comment that his voice is perfect for the radio because of how soothing it is. ) He was so great, one of my friends was determined to tip him $30. He was never bothered by requests and always asked us if we wanted this or that before we had to ask him. Amazing service.","I've been here a couple times now and the service is always fantastic and attentive. The fairly limited menu comprises \"Canadian Comfort' dishes that never fails to impress. Mind you if they've had a busy day they might be out of certain dishes . . like salt cod donut appetizer. . The Bannock bread is featured through out the menu from the pizza to the wraps. I've either had or sampled the pot pie, carne pizza, fish cakes, salads, and desserts. I've enjoyed them all. . . . especially as leftovers as the portions are fairly large. Their fresh juices and lemonades with their unconventional blends are also quite delicious. . They were baby friendly and made room for us to park the stroller though the bathrooms are definitely not baby friendly as there's no place to change a diaper. Definitely recommend making reservations though we've lucked out both times without making any. They also have a neat cafe and grab and go section. . The decor is truly Canadian featuring antique pine and hemlock reclaimed from one of the Queen's wharfs that sat under the waters of Lake Ontario at York Street for over a hundred years (mentioned on their website). I'd definitely be going back ! . We had two appys, three mains, 2 mocktails and a beer for $100 all in","Excellent slices of thin crust pie with tasty options like garlic and mushroom or chicken, ranch and cheese. Huge portions of pie and great place to stop in and have some good pizza right out of the oven. Great ambiance too.","We stayed here for 5 nights at about $50/night. Damn cheap for Vegas! The Flamingo is the second oldest hotel on the strip. It is no Bellagio and it is no Wynn, but it is nicer than most hotels I usually stay at around the country. Also, this hotel is smack-dab in the middle of the strip and perfect for checking out the surrounding hotels and sites. . I like it because it has that 1950s look to it. It has this cheesy pink decor, which I liked because it's vegas! At night, it is the essence of old school Vegas and I loved looking at it. Donny and Marie are the big names performing there right now, which fits in perfectly with the hotel. . The room was decent, the view we had overlooked the tropical pools below and it was nice. Everyone who helped us was polite. . The great thing is that there are plenty of shops downstairs, a casino, a food court, and there is a pizza center which makes a really good pizza for late night snacking at only $12. Plus you should get the fries. For only $5, you get a mountain. And the gelato is good too. While you're there, try the burger place next door. I haven never seen such large burgers in my life. . Check in is a nightmare. Definitely go off the the side and do the express electronic check in to save yourself an hour of waiting in line. . I would go here again if on a budget.","It was alright . Don't see what the fuss is all about. Kind of heavy pizza. Tried it but going back to my east of Chicago !","We have been coming here for almost 2 years! Tonight I had their gluten free pizza (dough imported from Italy) and it was very good. Best gluten free pizza I've had! The beet salad is always a winner! The service is friendly and prompt. Local first cider and house brew are great. Tonight we had all our kids and it was fun. Usually this is a date nigbt. Place for yummy food and beer.","The pizza was very good!  The wings were great as well. We will definitely buy our pizza from Palm Pizza again!!","For those who are wondering why or complaining about fitness centers offering pizza and bagels, if you eat them before exercising or working out you will actually benefit from the complex-carbs.","On Friday night I take my kids for carry out pizza. Knowing that expecting a little wait for our 2pizzas and a 2 liter of soda and crazy bread?!? I understand the hectic atmosphere during the Friday night rush. But 45 mins not exaggerating. Really I could have gotten delivery 30mins or it's free. After seeing the . 3 Rd person leave. I went into check on my kids who was waiting. After expressing my concern for the extrmely long wait. . The lady didn't say anything refunded our money and gave us the pizza. . Leaving now a happy customer. Thank you for turning my frown from up side down to a smile. . Great !! Thank you.","Every time I have ordered from this store, I have never had a problem with the food. The pizza is always hot when I get there, is still hot when I get home 10 minutes later, and tastes delicious. I use online ordering because I can make the pizza exactly how I want, I get a confirmation email, and it's super convenient to access on my smartphone when I'm on the go. . The only issue I have is that the cashiers often act like it's an inconvenience to them that I come pick the pizza up. I feel like they're in no hurry to assist me when I walk in. I don't trust any delivery service to get any hot food to me, and I would like to be treated a little better when I make the effort to come get my food. However, that only cost them one star because the pizza is still wonderful.","I've been to scaddabush twice. . Ambience: Modern, but with a rustic feel. Liked the candelabrum on some of the tables. It's two levels and you can book large parties upstairs. There's a bar area with a fair number of screens to watch sport games. I really like the music there. The DJ plays 90s throwback, which is awesome in my books! The main washrooms are upstairs and there is one accessibility washroom  on the main floor. Reservations are easy to make online through open table. . Service: I had pretty good service both times. The first time, the service was slower, but we were there at a busier time. Servers are knowledgable and tells you what the specialties are without you asking. If you are sharing pasta, they split it up in two bowls, which I always like! Very detailed oriented. B+ to A. Food: scaddabush is known for their fresh mozzarella cheese, pasta, and meat balls. . Today, we tried:. Prosciutto mozzarella - the combo together with bread, fig jam, and mozzarella was pretty good. The mozzarella was very fresh and chewy. I found the mozzarella pretty tasteless on its own, but mozzarella normally does not have a lot of taste. B. Capri pasta: seafood tomato pasta. The mussels are fresh and there's a lot of seafood in the dish. the pasta is super fresh. The only issue was the pasta did not have much taste. The tomato sauce was watered down. Not too impressed, but pasta itself was great. I would buy it to cook at home. B. Primavera pizza: the pizza dough is very tender and soft. However, I found the pizza a bit tasteless. I don't like olives, but the Olives gave the pizza flavour, which was good. B . Mojito drink: it was ok. A bit too sour for my liking, but the drink has orange it in so it's supposed to be sour. . Overall, i wouldn't say the food had a lot of flavour, but it is definitely fresh. Overall grade: B","Stumbled upon Fajitas while driving around. . . . . . lost in Phoenix. . Frikkin' GPS! Left turn here! Right turn now!!! We damn near hit a lightpole before we got our asses good and lost! Grrr!!! Anyway, somehow through this mess we located Fajitias and yazz, yazz!!!. Ya' can't go wrong with amazing deals! The place is actually quite huge and the margaritas (offered at $3/each) didn't disappoint. . We'd actually ordered the Mexican pizza as an appetizer thinking we'd be able to make it to an actual entre\u00e9 (#fajitas). . . . . But this thing arrived and was so huge that it literally became a meal. The savings from not ordering an actual entre\u00e9 allowed us to order extra booze. . We departed full of food and booze for less than $20. Unbeatable!!!","At work we love to order Jets since it's conveniently close. The flavor is just great. I like ordering the two slices of pizza (that are really big) that comes with a soda because it's under 7 bucks. Sometimes ordering on the phone is an issue because I've experienced a lot of errors with this store. Forgetting ranch,  given the wrong soda,  and for when we order a large pizza they never seem to get it right for what we want on each half of the pizza.","I've been going here for YEARS, they have an awesome lunch special. $4. 60 for a drink and two slices of cheese pizza. The slices are huge! Their stromboli's are also delicious. They have recently changed their name on the glass windows to \"500 degrees pizza\" but the original sign remains on the building.","Manger is great . Food is good and servers are friendly. Love the pizza -- $6. 00 on Monday and little extra for other toppings. Beer section is great . Lots of local stuff.","Ok, so I've been ordering from this location for months now and each time the delivery service is getting worse. Im at the point that i will not order from then anymore and will not tell anyone of my family or friends to order from them ever after today. I ordered their $25 coupon of 2 large 2 topping pizzas and 20 wings today. I placed this order at 12:35 pm and as told it would take an hour for delivery(which seemed a bit excessive at this time of day. Since it was after lunch rush). So as the hour mark came and then went the order was still not here. At 20 minutes after the hour it was still not here, so I called them to ask where my order was since its now been an hour and 20 minutes. The girl on the phone proceeds to go on to tell me that the order was out for delivery and quickly got off the phone. So again I sat outside waiting and again another 10 minutes went by and no order. I called back again and this time the girl put me on hold to see where the delivery girl was at. She came back on the line and tried to tell me that there was traffic that delayed the driver and that she was less then 5 minutes away. Now that began to irritate me since they are only 3 miles from where I live. There's not that much traffic that would delay a delivery by 30 minutes. The girl just kept saying she was sorry and never offered up any comps of any kind to show any customer appreciation to keep me as a customer. I then asked her what they were going to do to compensate me for not having my food by an hour and a half. She then says oh well I can give you a $10 credit on your account for your next order. I said fine and hung up expecting my order in under 5 minutes as they claimed. Well that was a lie yet again as it took the driver an additional 12 minutes to finally show up. So now its been an hour and 42 minutes; the driver got out and acted like nothing was wrong. She asked \"hi how's your day going?\" I responded with \"it would have been better if my order was here over 40 minutes ago, on time. \" She then got very snotty quick and snapped \"well there's only one of me and your total is $30. 58. \" I said \"well I would like to check to see if my food was still hot before I pay for it. \" She pulled out one pizza and handed it to me and I checked it. Granted it wasnt as hot as all my other orders from before but it was warm enough that I went ahead and paid for it. I then handed the driver $40 and she said \"let me get your change. \" The change should have been $9. 42 she came back and handed me only $9 not even saying sorry I don't have any change, change she just assumed she could keep the 42 cents and hesitated like I was going to give her more for a tip. Well now I'm seeing red so that's all she got as her tip was the 42 cents she assumed she could just keep and I walked away from her. This whole delivery was the worse experience I have ever had from this place. They acted as though my order didn't matter in any way. They acted like they were irritated with me for being upset for not having my food for over and hour and 40 minutes. It will be awhile before I order from them again if I do decide to.","Wanted some pizza and wings on a Friday and this place did not disappoint. Got there around 5:30/6 and didn't have to wait for a table. We sat downstairs. I got the pear arsenal cider which was amazing (and half off during happy hour). Personal pizzas were also $5 with one topping so I couldn't pass that up. It was everything you'd want a pizza to be. We also got two orders of wings (black and gold/honey Sriracha), which were phenomenal. I can't wait to go back.","I ordered Sophia pizza and I was expecting a delicious food with proper spice. What I ended up eating was testing horrible , super spicy which burned my mouth. I couldn't even have the second slice. The funny thing is we checked the menu to see if there was any indication of the spiciness of the food! No! Nothing . I'm assuming they just dropped the bottle of pepper in the pizza hoping no one will notice.","Great if you're looking for a hip atmosphere but you can find more creative and tasty pizza elsewhere in Madison. Good spot for a first date or quick drink but their pizza was expensive and forgettable. Their garlic mascarpone and mushroom pizza was simple and tasty but that was as interesting as the pizzas got.","Bad service and never enough cheese pizza, this place used to be good but it's gone downhill.","Amazing that this place is inside a Hilton Garden Inn. Much more high end than I expected. Fresh pizzas, bruscettas and great entrees. . Would definitely go again.","Can't speak for the pizza - I've been there twice and haven't had it yet. But a Downtown Vegas spot with VEGAN SOFT SERVE? I approve immediately. Within the first 4 days I was here I had it twice. Swirl is best - but for $3 - this is the best deal in vegan desserts in Las Vegas.","So my bf and I came back here for our 3rd time (never wrote a 2nd time review bc it was great like the 1st time) 3rd time meh not so good. We ordered the Caprese salad which is our fav! But the cheese tasted like rubber! it was so dry and hard and we were surprised b/c it was sent out with HUGE pieces. I told the waiter that it didn't taste right at all and he tried to convience me that it was more \"fresh\" and that is why it tasted like that. . . I beg to differ, I order Caprese salad prob 2x/week for yrs and this was not good. He took the plate away and we sat and waited for 10 mins for him to at least offer us menus. We never got them. At that point I just wanted the pizza. My bf ordered 6 wings which he said were average, nothing special. Pizza was amazing like always. The waiter returns and told me in fact the cheese was dried? wrong and the manager and agreed and said that they were going to stop serving the Caprese b/c it got too dry or the water was taken out of it too much? I don't really understand the process of making mozzarella cheese but I was happy he at least agreed with us. Kinda thought they would offer a small salad or dessert to compensate but nothing. Just had the pizza and my bf had some extra wings. I would return but JUST b/c I love the pizza there. We may order the caprese again since it is such a big portion and usually really good. But this waiter totally turned us off. The last 2 times we were there we had female waitresses who were AMAZING, maybe the male servers aren't that good? Hope I am not being too sexist hehe :)","I have frequented this place all throughout the school year, and I think I can confidently say that Papa Ceo is one of my favourite pizza places in the area. I fail to recall a time when I left disappointed. . Venue:  There really isn't anything fancy about this place. It's pretty old and the sitting area consists of several metal table/chair combo fixtures you might find in older mall food courts. They are pushed right up to the wall so it can difficult to access sometimes should you decide to sit near the wall. The staff keep the area decently clean, but sometimes I think it could be cleaner. This has never really bothered me personally, but don't expect much should you decide to dine in. In terms of their hours and location, Papa Ceo is easily accessible to U of T students in the area and are open quite late, closing at around 3-4 am most days of the week.  . Food:  If you are looking for slices, they offer 8-9 different kinds of pies you can choose from (availability can vary depending how quickly they sell) and range from your traditional margherita to unique flavours like clam chowder. I've probably tried them all and haven't found one I disliked. The pizza is made New York style (thin crust). I find the crust to be crisp on the outside yet kinda fluffy and soft on the inside which is something I really like in a crust. At $4. 50 a slice (tax in) the portion size is more than generous (seriously, it's like a quarter of a pizza) and easily fills you up for lunch or dinner. If slices aren't your thing, they offer a few deals for full pies and a long list of different toppings to choose from. For what you get, i'd say their prices are quite fair. . Customer Service:  While staff come and go, the quality of service has always been great. Definitely more than I would expect from a pizza place. Every time I've walked in, everyone seemed happy, friendly, and were smiling. They've always greeted me when I walked in and thanked me as I walked out the door. It doesn't seem like much, but when you've had a rough/crap day (and believe me I've had many this year), it's the little things like this that really help make the day just a bit more bearable (well, at least for me). . Overall, Papa Ceo is a great pizza place. Despite the appearance of the venue, I think the quality, price, and size of the pizza is great. I highly recommend giving this place a try if you are in the area.","Stopped in on a Saturday for some pizza and was pleasantly surprised. Had one white and one red pizza - they are each four slices. Good ingredients,  tasted good. They do have wine and beer, but we didn't get it this time. A little pricey compared to others, but a good place for Italian food in Madison.","Excellent food and staff! We ordered the jalape\u00f1o corn arancini and an half margherita and half Gotham pizza. Really tasty! . Our server, Victoria, was exceptional!","I've ordered late night delivery for pizza, pasta ans wings as an experiment. Everything sucked. I will never order from them again.","Bannock was one of the first places I ate at when I moved to Toronto, and it has had a special place in my heart ever since. If you haven't had bannock before, the bannock bannock is a great introduction. Or, if you really need a pick me up, get the ridiculously rich duck poutine pizza. . It's reasonable prices, can't-go-wrong \"Canadian comfort food\" menu and central downtown location make it a destination. The service, as with any O&amp;B establishment is always top notch.","We were staying at a hotel nearby. Really delicious pizza, super fresh!! Kids loved it, adults loved it! We have 2 margharita pizzas, a \"build your own\" (spicy salami is really good) and a salad. . The staff went above and beyond and were extremely accommodating. Our entire experience was wonderful!","They accommodated our big group in the separate dining area to the right of the arcade once you first enter. My friends have raved bout this joint and wanted to try it out. Upon entering the place, you would think it's one of the smaller chain restaurants with greasy pizza (barros). But the food actually surprised me here. . Got the old world salad which was filled with all kinds of goodies like feta cheese, olives, red onioin, peppercinis, roasted peppers, cucumber, etc. I think the best part of the salad was their tomato house dressing which is phenomenal. It has a tangy balsamic taste to it which is awesome with any salad I would imagine. Maybe even dip ur pizza in it. . Next time I gotta try some of their pizzas though and I will report back!","I ordered there Brooklyn style Philly cheese steak Pizza. I asked for them to put the  garlic crust but I guess the forgot. When I opened up my pizza box I was extremely disappointed  there was little to no meat on the pizza litterly only about two slices had meat on a large pizzs. . . wtf I did order a philly cheese stake. Know $23 latter and still dissatisfied. . With so many other pizza options around idk if I will be back.","Just stopped in for ice cream. It was good and the pizza smelled great. I would come back and try their food. Plenty of seating inside and benches outside. Workers were friendly.","Yummy yum yum yum yum yum yum. . Okay, this was good. . The menu has a great variety. Awesome salads, meatballs, pizzas, different apps, and the pasta. . . I am going back for the pasta. I didn't try the fresh pasta but I had some of the penne and what ever they are doing with that goddamn sauce is some kind of magical elixir. I don't really eat pasta, on account of the fact that I totally lift, and I don't wanna overload my carbs #brolife but I am going to go back and eat some of this pasta. Maybe a lot of it. Maybe just a few teaspoons. No one knows at this point. Except god. Who doesn't exist. . So anyway, the atmosphere in this place is awesome. They made some great changes and it feels like a space you want to hang out in. Which is exactly what I did. Inside my own personal body. I also had a chance to meet the owners who were very nice. Pro tip; got a problem with something? Say something. . Also, while they have a nice sized TV if you want to watch the game, you would never know it's there unless you sat at the bar. Which I might sometime. But I might never do it. I'm unpredictable that way. You might find me in the far back corner as far from the TV as possible. You can't cage a bird, so don't even try. . Hilarious that anyone would complain about their home made poutine. They make their own gravy and it's really friggin tasty. Especially when it's in your mouth. I just drooled all over my own keyboard. I am going to go talk to the owners and see if they will buy me a new keyboard as a result, or at least pay to have mine cleaned. If they don't, I will be back and I will post a 1 star review. . GET IT TOGETHER LAMBRETTA.","If you LOVE Lou Malnatis like I do, you will be very disappointed by this pizza. We ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because this location is close to the house wanted to try it out. The pizza sauce tastes like the sauce out of a jar, super disappointed by this pizza! Wish they changed the sauce then could be a lot better! Won't be coming back, worth the drive to go to Lou's!","Just dined here this evening. I have to say this place had hands down the worst service I have ever received. Party of 3 adults, the server suggested we order 3 pizzas and an appetizer. We were not interested in their limited appetizer menu so we decided to skip it and ordered the pizzas. It took 45 minutes to get the food, I know they bake it fresh so I was willing to wait but the pizzas were bland and overpriced. And we had 1 and 3/4 pizza left, her suggestion of 3 pizzas was far too much food. Honestly, I would skip this one.","Location is everything. . Located on my usual stumble home, Pizza Extreme is quickly becoming my 3 AM stop of choice. Bring a couple of friends, randomly select 5 items (ranging from chicken drummies to pizza of decent quality), and head home to play some Tekken. If you're a couple 7&amp;7's into your night, you will not be disappointed.","First time here and was excited to try from hearing that it was voted best happy hour in Vegas. We came 3pm one Monday. The service was slow for the place not being busy at all. The strawberry Bangkok drink was really good along with the yellowtail collar. Nothing stood out for me, tasted like an Americanized sushi bar. I've had fresher fish elsewhere and the rolls were lacking flavor. My boyfriend really liked the Cajun pizza, their dough was great. We spent about $80 and I still was not full or satisfied.","We had heard some good things about this place. . . . so we were excited. However, it's sub-par at best. Service was slow and rude. . . . a rarity in this part of Wisconsin, and the pizza was edible but I don't understand why people think it's that good. We won't be back.","Service here is impeccable, the gorgeous girls are always beaming with huge smiles as they serve u giant slices of pie! I try to always stop for a slice when I'm at the Aria Poker Room. Some of the best wood-fire oven pizza in Vegas, hands down. A little on the pricey side. . $7 or so for a slice but it's very large and filled with healthy toppings.","Really nice place and excellent pizza if you don't mind the crust being a little thick. I also had a bruschetta with grilled octopus for lunch the other day. That was FANTASTIC.  I would eat that at every meal every day. . . . . Update: the whole office dreams of having lunch there. It a all time favorite. Also brought my kids:  pizza diavolo for one and gnocchi for the other. They want to go back, they are obsessed!","Part of the Barnone complex in Agritopia, this pizza place offers limited, tasty fare. We got pizzas, shaksouka, and barrata salad to eat and beer from the small brewery next door. The pizzas were quite delicious, thin crust and flavorful toppings cooked in a wood fired oven, and the shasouka was spicy, savory and earned a spot with dollaps ladled on our pizza. The namesake Fire and Brimstone pizza was cooked chewy yet crispy, with hearty toppings that complemented the spiciness from jalapenos. The heirloom tomato and barrata salad came encircled with balsamic dressing that added to the earthy flavors. The pizza, sides, and beer equalled a delicious meal. We recommend giving Fire and Brimstone a try.","We love coming here for casual dinner and lunch. It is also kid friendly unlike other Westgate restaurants. I wish they had pizzas in smaller sizes bc after a salad and appetizers,  the pizza was always too big for a group of 4. But we have always had good service here.","We like coming here because of the variety of items on the menu-pasta, pizza, sandwiches and salads. I have tried a few items on the menus and haven't been disappointed. Service is quick and you don't leave hungry.","I have been to custom built 3 times now the first time was before my yelp days and I boosted all over facebook about it. I let all my friends and family know how awesome of a place it was as well as how awesome the customer service was. I think things have changed since then. . Allow me to elaborate, the second time I went to custom built I quickly left the restaurant and choose not to dine there because I was turned off by this one employee today I went back and have found that the employees name is Larry. The time I walked out was because Larry was on the phone in the back and came out front to greet us. When he came out he was holding his cell phone in his hand and asked to wait a second as he finished his call, we didn't see this as a problem so we patiently waited. When Larry returned he had his cell phone in his hand and was hanging it up he placed the phone on a back counter came to the front and asked what type of dough we would like to choose. He quickly grabbed a regular ball of dough and was about to start kneeding it when I stopped him and apologized to him and told him loud and clear that I could not dine at his establishment since I did not see him wash his hands and we walked out. Bummed out by the incident I still did not want to simply stray away because of one employee so I told my wife we would give it some time and try again. . Well we did and we re-tried today. Like I said previously today the same employee that I walked out on was there and he was at the door. I take it that he did not remember the incident as he did not even recognize me. I thought that was great so that I could try and get a new experience and try and forget about the previous incident. I have to say the evening staff that first introduced my wife and I to custom built was exceptional they were up beat and seemed excited to just make a pizza. Today it felt like it was Monday and things were just crawling. If it was not for that one awesome employee that was genuinely happy to be at work I would have walked out once again that employee's name is MOE and the first thing that he did when he saw us and asked us the dough we wanted was go to the sink and wash his hands!! I quickly pointed it out to my wife and said look at that exceptional employee that is washing his hand prior to preparing our food. Moe quickly keeded out the dough and placed it on the order line to get prepared. Excited by a happy employee this made me happy and I quickly remembered the first time I went to custom built. I said to the gentlemen that was preparing my pizza the first time I came here the young man that assisted me suggested to try and get creative instead of having the same mundane pizza. He suggested trying multiple sauces and I remember him saying you can split this pizza into 16th's to try and give us a challenge we love challenges. When I mentioned this to the guy that was helping me today he seemed a little put off by the whole thing and even said I don't know why he would suggest trying so many different things. I ordered the pizza in 3rds so that I could try the different sauces 1 pesto 1 alfredo and 1 spicy. The guy seemed very uncertain on how to spread the sauces in thirds so he just made circles that ended up bleeding into each other in the cooking process. I layered and layered my pizza with topping after topping after topping. I always have fun in that part I feel like I'm a kid again when I get to pick and choose. . My wife placed he order and I went to pay. When I was paying Larry was at the cash register and I told him that I forgot my belly card but had received the message that all custom built pizzas were 6. 95 for the month of April. He said ok and then I showed him my yelp 10% off for checking in for the first time he again shook his head to which I thought was a clear sign for him acknowledging it. I paid the tab and was just handed my change. I thought that was a bit odd so I asked if I could have my receipt. Larry printed a receipt and gave it to me, I say a receipt because I was unsure if it was actually mine I paid with a $100. 00 bill and did not nee that on the receipt and I also did not see a discount. I didn't want to be rude and be like YO! WHERE MY DISCOUNT SON!! so I just kept quite and said to myself the food will clearly change my mind and it will be worth every penny. . Well I got my pizza and it was totally not what I expected the sauces had all bleed into each other and I could not tell the difference from what was pesto what was spicy and where the alfredo started and ended. Also today I watched as Larry was at the cash register and then went to make a pizza for a guest with out washing his hands AGAIN!!!! SOME ONE NEEDS TO GO OVER SAFE FOOD HANDLING WITH LARRY BEFORE HE GETS SOMEONE SICK!! . I don't know if I can try custom built again and I was a fan :(!","Best take out sushi I've had in the city so far. It's not expensive but it's extremely well made and very fresh even on a Sunday night of a long weekend. That's impressive. The sushi pizza, spicy ofc, was huge and so pretty! Which is what you want in sushi pizza, attractiveness. . But really, this is my new go to! :')","I was so pleasantly surprised to find these jewel . I was so happy with our salad and pizza. I felt like we were in Rome. The authentic food and personnel added a touch of genuine Italian dinning to our neighborhood.","Reasonably good. The service was pleasant, but the room was cold. The dough was too thick on the perimeter of the pizza. Try the homemade hot sauce, though. It was tasty.","Although in a questionable location, the inside appeared clean and open. The dining area was darker and I didn't go in that side. I was greeted upon entering by Juan. Both men in the kitchen were friendly. I ordered to go and was brought a warm garlic knot while I waited; it was delicious. I took my meal home, the price was just over $30 for a 10\" pizza with about 4 toppings, and 10 chicken wings. The wings were ok, not great, but I don't care for breaded chicken wings - they get soggy. The pizza looked great but had no flavor aside from the anchovies. The crust was as bland as eating a pizza box. The dinner didn't sit well in my stomach. Sadly, as nice as the owner was, I can't recommend the food. The gelato looked good but I didn't try it. Great service- not great food.","Came here for dinner during December to have some authentic Italian pizza but wasn't extremely impressed to be honest. The restaurant is beautiful with excellent service and a varied menu. We decided to split the Arancini and the meatball to start and then had an arugula pizza topped with extra prosciutto. The starters were just ok - I've had better arancini elsewhere and the meatball was borderline flavorless. The pizza was good! No complaints there except for the hefty $6 price tag for three slices of proscuttio added. Ended with some delicious sorbet which I want to say is made in-house but can't be sure. Overall a good experience - come for the pizza but skip the apps!","Simply the best!  Try the wood fire pizza and the chopped chicken salad. Love the service. . . Cody, Ray, Nicole, Kevin and the rest of the staff are always attentive and friendly. Go get some!","Nice friendly service. Very tasty pizza. Thin crust full of flavor . Pepperoni pizza with a side of pesto, real good. Classic Cesar's salad was good tasty croutons. If your in Vegas you have to eat here!","Lucille was great -- I went for a late lunch on a weekday, so it wasn't busy. Tried a couple of pizzas and salad and fried green tomatoes. It was all great -- I hadn't had fried green tomatoes like that in years. I'll be back my next time in town.","OK, but the crust needs to be thicker to be true NYC-style pizza. Having been a 30-year NYC boy, authentic NYC-style pizza has char. The real test is by holding up a slice and having it not droop.  then being able to fold the slice lengthwise and biting off a piece. If the pie has chew to it, you have authentic NYC-style pizza. Rocco's is close but, the crust is still too thin. Pizza places do that so the pies cook faster and they can crank out more for more profit. Sadly, that means far less quality. So, a C on the pizza from Rocco's. Now the stromboli is another story. Great crust and plenty of chew. Authentic fillings and sauce. Is there a difference between the dough used for pies and strombolis? Had the strombolis 3 times and each one was a grade \"A. \"  Strombolis took me back to my childhood in the Bronx. Pizza - decent but, not like I remembered.","My last visit. Placed a \"to go\" order 3 small pizzas, 2 with pepperoni and 1 with pepperoni and sausage, all with Asiago flavored crust. I walked in to Hungry Howies to pick up my order and the restaurant was empty. However, it still took over 5 minutes for an employee to acknowledge I was there and  to get my order. . The pizza honestly was one of the worst take-out pizzas I have ever had from Hungry Howies and the order wasn't even correct. I wish I would have looked at my order prior to leaving the store. I called Hungry Howies to let them know that not only was the pizza not very good but my order wasn't correct. The associate who answered the phone response was \"Sorry bout that, not sure who cooked it. I guess we can cook another\". After waiting another 20 minutes to cook another pizza I head back up to Hungry Howies and yes, once again my order wasn't correct (wrong flavor crust). Since I wasn't willing to wait another 20 minutes I took the pizza and headed home. . My previous experiences with Hungry Howies has always been hit or miss. I think I will drive a little further to one of the many other pizza places in my area.","O STARS an Option? . Used to come here years ago as a young child, raced all kinds of laps weekly (first opened). Over the years this place has gone down hill! The owner and his son are douchers, cocky, and selfish. They don't care about their employees just their customers that are giving the creedy individuals money on some sort. This place is WAY too over priced for some childish electric carts, buy some (real) gas go-karts. . and take one for a REAL race. The employees are unprofessional, they stand around the counters on their phones, and don't pay attention to the race track for a second set of eyes. . They don't wear gloves cooking pizzas. You're better off going to FAST LAP or somewhere else with GAS go-karts, and more reasonable prices!","Went to Chaz and Odette for my birthday dinner last month. . . made reservations at 8pm in advanced for 5 we had the upstairs back room to ourselves which was really nice. . Things started out pretty well. . we got a bottle of wine and other drinks. It took a long time but he seemed busy so we didn't mind. Since it was going a little slow we decided to order our apps and main course at the same time. The apps came out fine. The pizza was a little burnt but it was still edible. . Dinner was awful though. . Every dish except the mac n cheese was cold. Like not even warm, cold. We had the Chicken and Waffles and they were hard as rock, the grits were so disgustingly cold, the second pizza was way to burnt etc. The worst part was the server didnt come around to check on us because we would have been fine just asking him to microwave it or something to heat it up. . When he did finally check on us we pointed out that 4/5 dinners were cold and he straight up said he \"probably let them sit down there too long\" . He then asked if we were interested in dessert but we said no because it was already after 10 and dinner was over 2 hours so we didnt want to wait another 30 mins for dessert. . I hope these were just some new kinks that they straighten out but if not i would not recommend going here.","As a native Chicagoan I grew up going to Giordano's  as well as the other top Chicago style pizza joints. I know good Chicago pizza - this is NOT it!  The pizza was undercooked and frankly gross. My husband, myself and my daughter could not eat it. We even thew out our leftovers the moment we got home. They are doing Chicago style pizza a disservice. The chopped salad was delicious. The mozzarella triangles were great. The wait for a table was minimal. The wait for the pizza was 45 mins as expected. The restaurant was nice. The staff was nice. The high chair was even clean (harder to find then you think). But if a pizza place can't put out amazing pizza, nothing else matters.","Holy mother of pizza heaven, in all of my years of pizza eating this was by far the best I've ever had! We ordered the Verrazano (like a supreme) and all the meats and veggies married in my mouth with the right amount of cheese and crust. . . . light and thin. . . . tasty and delicious:))) Im glad a friend told me to try this place, it is right around the corner from my house and if i was never told how good it was I would have never tried it. I have a few places that I go for pizza and stick to them, this is now first on my list:)","In short: Splurge on the Menu Bianca at least once in your life. Then come back for more amazing food on a very approachable, upscale-casual a la carte menu suitable for anything from evening beer and pizza to a fancy dinner date.  . My wife and I came for the Menu Bianca for our anniversary last year, and it was one of the best meals we'd ever had. There are at least 12 courses, and yes, they are each very small-- some as small as a bite each-- but in total it adds up to a really full meal even for a big guy. It *is* more than a little shi shi, and for Cleveland $100 a meal is pretty high. But for a meal this size with these ingredients and this amount of care, you'd pay a lot more in most other cities. This compares to the French Laundry in terms of taste and attention to detail. It's amazing and delicious and you should try it once if you're into gourmet food. At $40, the pairing was an amazing deal-- a full cocktail, small beer, and the equivalent of three or four full glasses of wine for us. . So, that's the rare, dress-up-nice-and-blow-the-budget option. The menu, web site, and reviews make it look like this might be the only side to Trentina. But Trentina has another side. . What isn't obvious is that their a la carte menu is very reasonably priced, approachable, and suitable for a nice casual night out-- particularly on the patio. It's all still amazing food, hand made and carefully prepared, and as good or better than any other place in town. Appetizers, salads, crudos, and pizzas are all in the $8-12 range, pastas come in small ($8-9) or full ($16-18) sizes, and mains are in the $21 range. The market price fish was $28. This is absolutely stunning for locally sourced, fresh, chef-prepared dishes. Did I mention Jonathan Sawyer is a James Beard awarded chef? . We got the grilled broccoli and salmon lox for starters, and then the bucatini (small), osso bucco (small), and lasagna for mains. Service was a little slow to start, and so they surprised us with a free potato saltimbocca pizza. The wood-fired pizza was really tasty and as good as anything we had in Italy, the pastas were the real star-- particularly the osso bucco. Lox was amazing, but pretty small. The broccoli was incredible and complex--I would definitely get this again too. This amount of food would have fed three people handily (and all for about $60 if we had paid for the pizza). As it is, we took home half the pizza and lasagna for our lunches tomorrow. . The one negative: cocktails are overpriced and not all that creative.  $14 for mostly standard classics (modified takes on a G&amp;T, old fashioned, Manhattan) with good, but not amazing, ingredients. Stick to a pretty well-selected wine list, or have a Peroni. . We were way too full to try dessert.  . So, bottom line: Yes, you can come here and drop $300 a couple on an amazing experience that takes hours and is a real gourmet foodie, snobby treat. And you should. But you can also come for a plate of amazing, handmade pasta-- or a perfect wood fired pizza-- and a beer, on a casual weeknight dinner out. No, you won't find huge, Olive Garden style portions with unlimited breadsticks. But the meals are good sizes for any upscale restaurant. And whichever kind of night you're having, the service is top notch and doting, as befits any high-end restaurant. . One note: the web site is minimalist and a little daunting. No prices are shown and what looks like the lunch menu from the URL seems to also be the a la carte dinner menu. Open Table reservations ask for a credit card but don't indicate what will be charged or what the cancellation policy is. So it can all give off a little if-you-have-to-ask kind of vibe. Do yourself a favor and call and talk to the host, and they're very accommodating and can explain the menus to you.","Great pizza. I had a slice of cheese pizza that was just OK (NY style isn't my favorite) and a slice of the Blanca that was just wonderful. As far as pizza goes, it's not cheap at $5. 50 a slice, but it's one of the cheapest meals you can eat on the Strip.","The pizza exceeded our expectations. Good crust, fresh ingredients, not greasy. The service was fine. This is probably best as a takeout place though. The basement space was cold and dirty. It was empty when we were there. I would have thought it was really just used as a takeout place if not for all the food on the floor from the prior day. The space is used for storage and the TV was blaring. I'd give it four stars for the food but have to rate it down given how unpleasant it was to actually eat there.","3. 5* Food is just ok to me. . Came on a weekend, around 2pm and there was absolutely no wait. Usually, there seems to be a line-up on peak times like Friday/Saturday lunch and dinner times. . We ordered a Moretti, Zucca Salad (pumpkin), Mediterranean, &amp; Tiramisu. Both salad and pizza were ok, the crust wasn't crispy. I've had better pizza elsewhere. If you share it between 2 ppl, price is not bad. Otherwise it's a bit big to have on your own. . In terms of the beer, I was really surprised when it came in a tall pint. I'm pretty sure there was only 1 price listed for the beer, so when the bill came, I was surprised that I was charged more than what was stated on the menu. As soon as I brought it to the waitress' attention, she immediately rectified the situation. She was very nice and friendly. . Sandwiches/pastas seem pricey at ~$20 each, but at least with the pastas you'll most likely have leftovers, so it's a bit better in value.  . . I wouldn't be opposed to going back, but I'd probably try the pasta instead. They looked good with good sized portions.","I had never been to or heard of Cici's before so when we came here, I was completely unaware that it was an all-you-can-eat pizza buffet. Considering the selection and quality, it was almost too good to be true! I was aware, however, that they had a macaroni and cheese pizza which I was dying to try; it definitely lived up to my expectations. I was with a group of a dozen folks and we had a blast. They even had a fun little arcade and gave us fresh pizzas for our table. Everything was delicious, including the dessert cinnamon rolls and brownies. There needs to be more Cici's closer to the Los Angeles area!","My wife and I love this pizza joint. The pizza is great (especially compared to the generics like Pizza Pizza). We always get the family fun deal and upsize it to large pizzas. For $41 overall you get dinner plus alot of leftovers to cover a lunch or two. The folks working here are always friendly and the food is made quickly. For pizza in Pickering/Ajax, ever since Pie closed down this is the only place for us.","This place was delicious definitely didn't disappoint, so many options from Burger to chicken to pizza and salads. We got the Sriracha chicken burger, bacon blue cheese burger and the special of the day which was a peanut bacon burger, all were fantastic and so yummy, burgers cooked to perfection And everything was so fresh the pricing wasn't to bad either definitely not for the quality you got. Lots of outdoor seating not much indoor","A couple weeks ago, My friends and I arrived in Phoenix, starving, at about 1am with a 12 hour layover. We shuttled to a motel and discovered our only options were Jack in the Box drive-thru (no car) and Gus's. I'm not going to credit this place with an elaborate review. I didn't know pizza could taste this bad. I mean how do u mess up a pizza. I am not a food critic and I am not picky by any means. My friend could only stomach two slices and he can EAT! The pizza was flavorless, tasted like water just like one other reviewer mentioned and upon swallowing, the cardboard box seemed the more edible of the two. I'm not even kidding. . I must also mention the price. I know beggars can't be choosers. I don't mind paying out the ear for a edible meal when it's a last resort. . We paid $50. and change including $5 tip for the \"two gnarly pizzas and disgusting chicken wings special\".   . Included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee.","Best pizza ever hands down!! I've been coming here for pizza for over 5 years now and not once has it been bad. It taste just as amazing every time. If you're near it and want a really good slice of pizza I highly recommend this place! Plus it's hella cheap and they have more than just pizza.","They have the best pizza. Closest to New York style as you can get. The garlic knots were good. Not overly garlicky. I ordered online and it said it was through Grub Hub but when the guy delivered he was from Italian Village and typically they only deliver in a 5 mile radius. I was 7. 5 but they delivered anyway. Made my day.","Can get pizza by the slice and the stromboli and garlic bread are excellent as well. NY Pizza also has extremely quick service.","We order the meat lovers I recommend it. I will have some friends over for Thursday night kick off for the NFL will definitely have the pizza.","Ordered the other night from here and of course I didn't get pizza. I opted for the burger once again (I've been on a burger kick lately). And of course this place didn't disappoint. . The burger was nice and big, made sure it filled the bun. Topped with the usual lettuce, tomato and onion. Bigger than burgers you may find at other places in the city. I ordered fries as my side and was not disappointed with them. Nice size portion for the price. They had some type of coating on them that made them a little more crunchy than what you would find at any fast food place. . . Deliver is through GrubHub, so a fee does apply (this fee varies on the place you order from, from what I have noticed).","Stopped in here after hearing about the place from a friend. . All of the girls working were super friendly and prompt. The owner was also there, working alongside everyone. . I ordered a supreme pizza. It was awesome. The crust was crunchy, pizza was not greasy and the sausage was awesome. The sausage is fresh ground sausage placed on the pizza, not frozen sausage chunks (yuck) like most places. . I enjoyed it, and will stop back to try the pasta next time I'm in the area.","Love having this place in the neighborhood, the wings and pizza are the bomb. Happy hour is great, price of drink specials are cheap and we enjoy the atmosphere. Can't wait for the weather to cool to enjoy the patio, open those rolling windows up!","Oh Falbo. How I love thee, let me count the ways. . . . . . 1. You are quality pizza, every time. . 2. You are a great value. I do not mean you are cheap but you are quality without being pricey. . 3. You make great thin crust. It is not cracker thin. It is what thin crust should be. . 4. You do not get my order wrong. . 5. You have great staff, EVERY time. . 6. You are easy to get to. . 7. You keep your word on when my pizza will be ready. . 8. You remind me of home. Just good Chicago pizza. . 9. I can get a single topping pizza and be completely happy. They have AH-MAY-ZING sausage. . 10. You complete me.","The Steel pan pizza and Caesar with chicken were both fantastic, on top of the fact that It's a beautiful restaurant. Absolutely check this place out if you're in the neighborhood.","I knew I'd make it here one day and last Saturday, during a tour of the Pitt campus, I was provided the perfect opportunity to pop in and give this place a try without going out of my way. And I'll say it. . . I'm glad I didn't cross the Birmingham Bridge just  for this. Still, something about it is charming and authentic and well, original. And the food wasn't allll bad.  . First the good:  The fries were plentiful and amazing. I realize they probably never change the frying oil but I'm sure that's exactly what makes them so tasty. And the gravy. . . get the gravy!!  It elevates the fry experience to a whole new level. Also tried these fries with cheese; plain ol' ketchup; and bare naked. Delicious any way you go.  . The disgusting: The hot dog. I'm sorry but I don't get the hype. I like my hot dogs plump, juicy and preferably all-beef. This was shriveled, crunchy, crusty, overcooked, and well. . . I don't know what's in a hot dog but it wasn't all beef. I realized after ordering that you can in fact order an all-beef dog, but that leads me to the next point. . . . . The confusing:  I know this is part of the charm and what makes this place an \"institution\" in Pittsburgh and a gripe from a newcomer is worth about a penny, but wow. The menu is super busy and all over the place. . . leading me to miss the all-beef dog option. And I had absolutely no idea where to physically place my order (dogs in one section, fries in another, beer/pizza in another!!!). Fortunately it was mid afternoon, not too crowded, and a polite kid behind the counter had a surprising amount of patience with me.  . If for no other reason than a six pack of beer, I'm sure I'll be back at some point during my time as a part-time Pitt student.","Invited by a new acquaintance, we left the comfort of the Red Rock Resort and drove to Blue Diamond where we found a hidden gem. Cottonwood Station Eatery. We split a salad and also shared the alfredo pizza. Both were delicious! The historic photos and decor were very charming and added to the whole wonderful experience. . This place is very unassuming and unless you know about it, you'd probably never find it. Definitely a locals joint. . Katelyn, thank you so much for making us feel welcome!!!","Pizza and food was good but the service was lacking. They don't have the ability to handle large orders the day of. I don't fault them for having a small kitchen but they should have let me know they couldn't handle two extra large and three large pizzas, wings and a salad. Our order took over two and a half hours to receive and we had to go get it after wanting it delivered.","I have been here multiple times and have decided it's the best pizza I've ever had. So so so good. BLT pizza blew my mind. The cheese pizza has cream cheese on it and it is amazing. Both the deep dish and wood fired are amazing but the wood fired is the best pizza there is. On top of that, it's beautiful in there and there's a wonderful view of the capital. Everything on the menu is very cool and exciting. One of my favorite places!","When we were IN Pittsburgh a couple of weekends a go, I had forgotten to talk about Trundle Manor a life of Death. . To most people, they'd be freaked out. To us? We actually Google odd places to visit, while we're out of town. We hate normal lol. We had a blast!!. Everything is so odd and our lovely tour guide explained everything to us and answered all of our questions. . We were able to purchase some art before we left and they even asked if we wanted to join them and their parents for pizza. . Awesome experience. . We aren't in Pittsburgh very often. But, when we decide to make a day trio, we'll definitely visit again. . So much fun! Oh and their cat us a the sweetest!!","Last night my family at CiCis  Pizza. We hadn't eaten in this restaurant for about a year and boy have they changed. The restaurant is under staffed. We went up to the counter quite a few times and there were not any pizza's. It's hard to believe you go to a pizza buffet and NO PIZZA.  We waited 20 minutes for a desert pizza to be made. There were a few people working really hard but they needed more people. The floor had old napkin and it took quite a few minutes for the 1 person to take our used plates away. We will never go back.","Came here for an early dinner with a friend. It's not a huge place but it's good for a small group. Staff was friendly and answered our questions about the menu. We decided on two half pizzas. They have some quirky flavours like roasted duck or fig sauce as well as more traditional combinations. Pizza quality was excellent! The dough and ingredients tasted fresh and the more exotic flavours worked better than I expected. The desserts were a tad sweet but otherwise this place is pretty great!","Ray's is a greasy-pizza lover's wet dream. Be sure to plan your dieting around this place as you are sure to have higher cholesterol when leaving!!! :)","I have no doubt that this is THE BEST pizza in Henderson, no in Las Vegas. It's a great Mom and Pop restaurant the owners were super friendly and helpful. Joey M. had a request for them to make some cheesy bread that wasn't on the menu and they were more than happy to oblige. The dough for the pizza and for the bread sticks are the best quality I've ever tasted. The dough was light and fluffy, but the crust of the pizza were crisp, it had a great garlic taste that really brought out the flavor of the pizza. The pizza sauce tastes like it was home made too, very tomatoey and you can taste the herbs in the sauce. The best thing is probably the quality of the toppings. The cheese was the best I've ever tasted in a restaurant's pizza. The pepperoni was spicy, the bacon was crispy, and the ham was fresh and sweet. We got a large pizza which is 16\" take-out special for $8. 97 for plain cheese and extra for each topping. We can usually finish a large pizza pretty easily, but I could only eat one slice of pizza, Joey had three slices. We were more than happy to take the other half home and finish it today!  The large pizza with 3 toppings, special request of bread sticks, one soda came to about $22.","Great family spot or place to watch a game. Service is always efficient and friendly. Food is outstanding everything seems to be made from scratch. In house smoked chicken or pulled pork street tacos are a must try. My other favorites are California chicken sandwich, blackened tuna Cobb salad and chicken ranch pizza. House brewed beers are very good. The blueberry beer is excellent and a good rotation of ipa's.","Love Sainato's authentic Italian pizza and calzones. . . have been eating them since Louie was in Slavic Village. We really love the sauce, and I'm glad that he is selling jars now.","Sal was amazing pizza is always great come here often !  Out of all manhattan pizza this is by far the best  highly recommend","Excellent pizza and one of the best salads I have enjoyed in a long time. The chicken was really good and the surprise ingredients in the salad were roasted bell pepper and jalapenos. . . lots of them. Every bite was super fresh. The service was great too. I can't wait to go back and try everything on their extensive menu!","Pizzas are salty. All the time every time. I don't know why . My kids think it's gonna be better next time. No matter what kinda of pizza it's going to be salty. They also use cheddar cheese on most pizzas. The salads are good and we have had the Pablo Picasso a couple of times. The dirty monkey drink I ordered was mostly ice so the next one I ordered I asked if I could have \"light ice\" and when she brought me this the glass was just over half full to \"compensate\" for the \"light ice\". This was odd in my opinion. The first Dirty Monkey I had was so full of ice that it was all that hit my lip as I drank it.","Even though this place is small, the service and food was stupendous. . When my family went there, we didn't expect much, but for a good price, you can customize a pizza to its finest. The crust is thin and crunchy, the cheese is fresh, and if you get the garlic and spinach sauce, it really adds a kick. . It hardly took any time to have the pizza prepared and the man there was very cheerful and asking about adding or removing things, which didn't add to the cost. . He was very relaxed and just seemed to absolutely love his job, adding to an upbeat atmosphere. . Overall, loved the place, it was quaint and deserves more customers.","Thought I'd give them one more chance, tonight still zero hot and ready pizzas and now the customers are stealing sauces when the cashier leaves the counter, which is more often than she's there.","If your from Los Angeles you already know about Sharky's!! This place has amazing fresh, healthy Mexican food! Several different salsas to choose from which is great! From Mexican pizza, to tacos and burritos you have a variety of healthy food choices! The staff are great, very knowledgeable of the menu! This place got me through college in LA so I'm happy to see them expanding into Las Vegas! There will be a total of 14 places in Las Vegas once they are complete with their expansion into this market! A great choice of good food! Welcome to Las Vegas!","Doughy pizza with a bad sauce. . Plus I ordered mozarella sticks and they did not deliver them, charged me for them, and refused a refund. . Do not support this business.","As short as two years ago, RRBC was one of my favorite joints in the Cleveland area. Not a weekend went by that we considered eating there, and not a consideration went by before we decided that we'd go. Today, it barely enters our minds as a destination. Sometimes, when we drive by, I stare at it a little too long, wishing it was the RRBC of old, not the RRBC it's become. . While the beer recipes may be what have been brewed since I first dine there in 2004, it's just not the same. While the food is likely the same recipes, it's again not the same. Almost as if someone switched from hand pattied burgers to pre-packaged Sysco and figured it was good enough for them and the bottom line. And the atmosphere tries so hard to be Tremont or Ohio City with none of the charm. . There are a few bright spots, however; the french fries are still wonderful. The Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza is good, and the meatloaf dinner rivals any blue plate special out there in CLE+. The taco salad is filled with meat and more than enough for the money. . We don't go here much anymore, but, I think about it, and wish that it was how it was, instead of how it is.","I'm giving them one star because they produce pizza that is among the best in the city and another star because they've proven that Corsa Italia can support a dinning scene that is kicked up a notch.  . The prices are a little high for what they offer and the service could be given some pointers and from what I've seen and read on other sites from past employees, the proprietors and management can use an attitude adjustment. A server belittled the busboy in front of us once when the busboy brought to me a glass of wine that was only half full. Another time our white wine was room temperature. We brought it up with our server who reminded me of Yosemite Sam and wouldn't have looked out of place at a Tea Party rally informed me that white wine is served at a higher temperature than beer. Yes, thank you tips, now can you please replace my 22 degree wine. While he did correct the situation in the end, we received the cold shoulder the rest of the evening. When it came time to paying our bill there was a drink missing from it, we informed him and while we didn't expect him to kiss our feet, didn't receive much more than a, \"uh, ya, thanks. \" then printed us a new bill.  . There are many new pizzerias that have opened up with great service and while I appreciate their contribution in terms of atmosphere and food, snooty \"QSA\" isn't what St. Clair West needs.","The pizza is ok nothing to brag about and the service sucks had to go to the counter to get my drinks refilled and they looked at me like I had three heads.","This place has great pizza but my experience with this location has been awful. They either take over an hour to get you a pizza or they don't deliver it at all. The first time I tried to order a pizza from here they ended up being closed because of a management issue and I never got my pizza (I never got charged) but I also had to wait an hour and a half before realizing it was never coming. . The second time I ordered we had to call about delivery and they had the address written down as Camelflower instead of Camelback. Took about 90 mins. . The third time I tried to order a pizza it took 90 mins before it was delivered and that was only after I called to check in on it. They gave me a free pizza credited to my account as a result. . Now, I'm sitting here waiting for yet another pizza that was quoted as being delivered in 45 mins. . It has been 90 minutes, again. We called to check in on the pizza (see a trend?) and they said they only had one driver. Now, I'm wondering if my pizza is going to be cold. . Bottom line, if you can't figure out how to offer delivery then don't offer it. The food is good but the experience is awful. Stop telling people you deliver if you really don't (I could pull off this kind of delivery service as a one man shop). If you're wondering why Domino's or Pizza Hut has been successful it is because they've mastered the art of pizza delivery. Either figure your system out, or give it up. . If you're wondering if you should try this place then you should drive to the location and enjoy the food. Don't wait for your pizza to be delivered. You might starve.","I stopped in today to get a pie. . love the pizza. I am never disappointed. When I arrived at the check out to pay for my pizza. . my eyes couldn't help but to check out everything that was behind the display case. . so many delicious variations of pizza. . I decided on the meatball and banana pepper roll. It looked good!  So I purchased that. I brought back to the office and couldn't wait to try it . .  theres very little meatball or banana pepper. . it was all dough? (see picture)   . I certainly don't expect it to be oozing out of the roll but should be at least enough to see or taste it? Well the dough was good -  seasoned with a lot of garlic and ranch was provided. I am just gonna stick with the pizza from now on.","It's kind of difficult to find this place because, although the address is on King street, the entrance is on Ontario street. . Our group ordered the lunedi (special), carnivora, and patata &amp; pancetta pizzas. They were all delicious! I would say they live up to their claim of being the best pizza in Toronto because I have not tasted better pizza in the city. . We found the size of each pizza to be enough for one person. Others in our group ordered pastas and were disappointed by the portion size. . The decor is nice and the restaurant isn't too noisy. However, it is odd that the washrooms are not located inside the restaurant. . Overall we had a great experience and will be coming back for more pizza!","This is not real food. Everything is super processed to the point where you can taste it. The chicken fingers tasted like they came from a big frozen bag at Sam's Club and they were mushy when we got them. The ranch dressing was watery and tasted off brand. The pizza was also nothing to write home about. The best thing was the 2L coke we ordered. My family refused to eat it. Huge waste of $50. 00.","The new Rustic Pizza in Anthem was good. I am Italian and from the east coast so with that said I am still trying to find a great pizza place. We went 8:00pm at night to avoid the crowd and having to wait so long for food. The place was clean and the staff was very attentive.","It's always something here. The first time I ordered a Herb Chicken Mediterranean delite I called in the order. When I arrived they didn't even have my order and then argued with me. Whatever. It didn't delay my plans too much. The second time, I walked in and received a free pepperoni pizza. Cool!. The third time I ordered over the phone again and they forgot to add on the olives, but provided a little container of them for me.  . . . Ok. . . . ?. The pizza is good, just don't call your order in because you're risking it being incorrect in some way.","Great food (&amp; great prices!) An awesome family-owned/ local restaurant. Their pizza is AMAZING. We had their vegetarian pizza and geek salad. Fantastico! Dining in is a little tight as place isn't big but it is a great place for takeout. Great service.","Bannock is my favourite place downtown. I can get a quick coffee or sandwich if there isn't time for a real meal, I can get a beer while I wait for a meeting. I can also go back for dinner and have a delicious yet surprisingly affordable meal. At lunch I really enjoy the Turkey Burger with guacamole and a tempura battered onion ring. The meat is moist which is usually the challenge with turkey, isn't it?. The steak is great. The hearty duck-poutine pizza is a little much unless you really hate yourself, and the chicken pot pie with mashed potatoes is perfect. The meatless options are slim, but all quite good as well. So really, there's no reason not to go. . Reservations now accepted for lunch.","We found this place through Grub Hub- we have never been to the resturant itself but we have ordered their food for three nights and we tried a little bit of everything. Their eggplant parm is amazing and very tasty. Its as if they add something 'extra' to the breading that other places don't. My husband had a sandwich and he said the filling was great along with the dressing but the bread was a bit hard. . The appetizers don't fail- I go for the appetizer that has cheese sticks, zuchnni, mushrooms and artichoke hearts in it and it really wonderful. The deserts also don't fail. . We did try the stuffed pizza and we had mixed reviews here- I love it, my daughter loved it but since it was stuffed with ricotta cheese and my husband not being a fan of ricotta it didn't go over too well. The large pizza is HUGE to say the least and they don't skimp on toppings. . I recommend this resturant if you want pizza, pasta or even a slice of cheesecake but their sandwiches could use better quality of bread. . Other then that, Its a great place to eat and get your comfort food fix.","What I like about this place is that it is consistently good food, generous portions. It's one of the few restaurants in East Mesa that I know I can take visitors for a good, non-chain, meal. . I was there on Saturday and this is how it played out: Our attentive and friendly waiter immediately brought the super-soft, right-out-of-the-oven garlic buns. I ordered a Shock Top Belgian Ale and  the coconut shrimp with a baked potato and steamed veggies. My friends ordered Fettucini Alfredo with Meatballs, Steak Salad and a vegetarian pizza. I tried the Steak Salad and will definitely order that next time. Not that mine was bad. After all, the shrimp were more like prawns and there must have been 8-10 of them. The steamed veggies (varieties of string beans &amp; carrots) were perfectly tender-crisp. It's just that the flavor on the steak was surprisingly, uh, vibrant. I don't know what they marinated it in, but it tasted like it might have had some kind of citrus in it. Yum. . We ordered two desserts - the cannoli which was properly crispy and the baked apple dumpling was cooked enough to soften, but not make the apple mushy. Yum yum.","Not bad, but not really a wine bar as I expected one? More of a pizza place with a large wine selection. . The good: the Food! We had a white wine cheese plate and it was fantastic. The spinach brie pizza was also fantastic. The little Debbie themed truffles were amazing and spot on in taste! The wine was Ok, we had a red and a white, and the port  and sherry were also good with dessert. . The meh: the whole wine list was a name and a location, which told me nothing about the wine. A huge improvement would be describing the wine on the list and some suggested pairings would go a very long way. The wait staff knew a few of the wines, but could only describe a few, vaguely. . Over all: go. it's fun, it's pricy, it's a high end pizza place with lots of wine.","Hard to believe it was in this place. . . . Wonderful NY style slices from family run pizza place. Entering from Fremont St Mall into hotel at end of mall. Go to far forward left of casino. Watch out for all those crazy slot players maniacally feeding their electronic overlords!","We were here for a birthday party and my toddler seemed to enjoy it. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My daughter didnt really want to run across the Indiana Jones-ish bridge, or go down the tall wavy slides, but being the mother I am I made her go with me and the baby anyways. The baby smiled, oblivious to any \"fear\" and my daughter laughed and all seemed to be ok with mom there. By the way, the wavy slides are fast! I am glad that they allow parents in the play area and on the equipment, in the ball pit and on the slides with their little ones. It was not filled with adults but its a nice option if your child is a little nervous, or wants you to enjoy the fun too. After an hour of play they called us back to a room for birthday cake and pizza (the family arranged and brought their own food in) to celebrate. My only suggestions would be to keep the place a little more \"clean\" for lack of a better word? Perhaps a bit more modernized and less clutter in the back room.","The key word here is well done pizza. . That's what they mean the bottom is not really Brent but is is well done with the darkness and a crisp. . My family and I go here often and I think I have had mostly a lot of whats on the menu and I gotta say haven't found anything that I don't like. . . From pizza with cauliflower and spinach to ribs with jalape\u00f1os to wings that are seasoned to perfection to slices of provolone cheese with tomatoes and herbs atop. . I like it all is all different. . . . I had been talking to the manager after a beer and food tasting/dinner, and we talked about the different meals combinations of foods. He had stated that all the recipes had come from a long line of ancestors. . Food is not only differently good but it is excellent. As long as you get past the well done part.","Atmosphere is pretty nice (a mix between hipster loft and Scottsdale club). Beer selection is decent (better than the average restaurant). Food, however, was very disappointing. I am just glad we were there during happy hour and only paid $7 for our clearly frozen (digiorno) pizza.","Do not come to this place. First thing I see at this Kabob place is pizza rotating on a heat rack that looks 2 days old. Me and my friends order simple chicken Schwarma wraps and wait in the dining area. About 20 minutes later only one of us gets our plate. The server didn't even look like he knew what he was doing AND I saw his hands touch our food when he served it which is disgusting. The rest of us were waiting for another 15 minutes which is a ridiculous time to wait for a simple wrap. The cashier and server came into the dining room to ask what we ordered about 3 times. It's really not that hard. Just make a chicken wrap 4 times. . They then asked other diners what they ordered which shows us just how unorganized they are. When I eventually got my food I had more fries than an actual wrap. Service horrible and food sub par. Not coming back.","Enjoyed everything about the bar. But the lack off staff means service was slow. . Roomy rest rooms, spacious dining area, OK beer selection. Loved the pizza.","We just celebrated our Son Colton 5th Birthday party here and let me tell you it was absolutely amazing!! We paid for a total of 8 kids and they bowled for 90 mins, with a round of Glow in the dark miniature golf, and then each kid got a $5 Arcadia game card it also came with 4 large delicious pizzas and unlimited drinks for the kiddos! I will defiantly be using this place again for future birthday party's!","I think it's better to order and wait in the store than to order online or call it in. Not that it was faster at the store, but the wait time is less - about an hour less. So, we called the store to check on our order and was informed that it would be arriving at 8:15 PM or so. Or so. That's scary. Indeed. It took over an hour and a half for the two pizzas to arrive. Would have been done with dinner and already at home had we gone out to eat at a restaurant. It might have been more expensive but less inconvenient. Talk about paying for convenience! Anyway, girl that delivered our pizza said they were busy when we asked what was going on. I mean, really?! Our order wasn't complicated. I don't understand how others can deliver a similar order in half the time. No, not even half the time! It's less than half! Good news, our order was correct and the pizza was still hot enough to be enjoyed. That's what the two stars are for.","Great pizza! This place is pretty big so you don't have to wait for a table. The pizza was delicious and there were so many options! The wine was also great. Cassandra was very attentive and helpful with suggestions. Later at night it also turns into a good bar for going out at. Overall a great place!","I was craving delivery food and was checking for good deals in the area and i saw the 5 topping large pizza promo and pop so i placed an order and wow! it can only be said the last time was an accident or something but today's delivery was steaming hot, thin crust crunchy pure deliciousness and yes I am super picky with pizza if you can't get the thin crusr well done concept down you lose my business! had it delivered to my house thru a mobile app order and. the delivery guy was super nice and polite as well!!  Well done Domino's!! i am a fan again!","Golly, I would tell people not to go here. I simply ask for four pizzas, two with pepperoni, one with olives, and one with pineapple. They gave me only two pizzas, one with pepperoni and olives, the other with pepperoni and pineapple. I can't eat meat. I was with another person, who didn't mind the other topping on his pepperoni. I went back to let them know they made a mistake. I was charged for two more pizzas one with only olives and one with only pineapple. I saw someone tell the cook, how the pizzas should be made. Once I got my two pizzas, they had pepperoni with olives and pepperoni with pineapples. AGAIN! I was on lunch, there was no point for asking to fix this problem again because I had to go back to work. Brought it up to them, ask them if I could just get my money back since I can't eat the pizzas they made me. I was told I could not get my money back only credit. I don't want credit because that was my lunch money to eat. I was told by the employees, \"mistakes happen. \" After I ask for my money back. Which I understand mistakes do happen, I work in customers service too. But when I see an employee tell the cook how the pizzas should be made, one with only olives and one with only pineapple, and both pizzas still end up having pepperoni on it. That's not just a mistake. Which I still have the receipt that's says cheese pizzas with olives and pineapple.","Charming little pubs in charming little character homes is apparently a \"Calgary thing\". No joke - I saw about five while I was there, happily visited two and had the same reaction every single time: An inherent \"Awww!\", followed by a sharp pain of homesickness (and generally, a pint or two). . Vancouver just doesn't seem to have the good ol' neighbourhood pub around the corner and this former Newfoundlander had her heart strings tugged a few times on Alberta soil. . My gosh, I love me a pub. . This place is pretty dang cute. It's got a pool table upstairs; a good craft beer selection and makes a great pizza. Really. . . what more do you want? Whimsicality + beer &amp; pizza. . . it's the perfect combination. Bonus whimsy points for keeping the kitchen door open so you can see that yup, there's an ancient 60's oven in there. It's not being used as an oven. . . or at least, I would assume not, but it definitely reminds you that, \"Oh hey, you're in a wee house. Continue to be charmed. \". Service is a little lassez faire, which is French for: It's a pub. . . go up to the damn counter to order. The BBQ chicken pizza is extra delicious with banana peppers added. And if they start carrying a better irish whiskey selection, I would consider moving in. . Just kidding Vancouver, I still love you. Psst, Calgary: *wink wink*","DO NOT EAT HERE!!! i purchased a Groupon deal for family meal: large cheese pizza, 20 wings, 2 L soda. WORST pizza EVER!!we ordered over the phone and picked up the order. it was so greasy, the oil soaked through the box onto my car seat. the flavor is so-so-similar to frozen. the cheese was low quality, the crust was blahh, and the worst part: the sauce was thinly spread. the wings were hard, dry, and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. the soda was the only thing our family can use. we also ordered manicotti, some Beach title pizza, and garlic knots. manicotti was okay. Beach pizza was same as cheese pizza with only meager toppings thinly spread out. the garlic knots were hard enough to toss like a rock. we had to order from Papa John's. it is so true: if a deal is too good to be true, it usually is. .","I think I expected more from this place because its supposed to be \"New York\" pizza and the decor of the restaurant is decorated very New York-ish. But I guess it is New York style, thin crust, sliced pizzas ready in the display window. . . but as for the taste, yeah not so much.  . The couple times I ordered pizza from there, the crust was semi burned with black burn spots on the crust and on the bottom. The cannolis were just OK and smaller than others I've had.  . Maybe I'm just comparing it too much to the \"real thing\" and being biased. Word of advice:  Less than a mile down the road is Rocco's NY Pizza. . . definitely go there instead!!!","Our favorite place for pizza, pasta and salad! They say you can judge a good Italian restaurant by its sauce and it's house dressing. If that's true, then this place rocks! My favorite is the cheese pizza, antipasto salad and the sausage appetizer. Their spaghetti with meat sauce is also out of this world. . . enough for two people. I can't believe I am lucky enough to have this wonderful place in my own backyard! I just wish they would bring their Cobb Salad back, it was sooooo good!","Their shrimp tacos are amazing. Also Mexican pizza! We haven't found anything we didn't like. Very busy on weekends, but Monday night's are perfect.","No place settings - had to steal from empty table. Dough wasn't cooked all the way, cold and doughy in spots with hot toppings? Frozen pizza kinda quality. Salads were drenched in dressing to the point of soggy lettuce.","we went on a wednesday after work for a co-worker's goodbye dinner. we had a really good time. . the prix-fixe menu was $25 and the portions are enormous. i had the mussels, lamb shank, and the tiramisu. mussels are cooked with curry which was a bit interesting, i usually have them with white wine or tomato sauce. . . the lamb shank was actually very tender and yummy, i only had two bites cuz i was talking too much and the mussels filled me up quite a bit already. the tiramisu was very good and huge - i ate it all. i had the lamb for lunch the next day. . other things our party got and gave good reviews are the veal parmesan, salmon, steak, burgers, and pizza. the spanish paella was just. . okay. . the waiter was really nice and we were able to get bill split altho there was like 20 of us in the group.","Tried this pizza place today for the first time. I was very surprised how great the food was for the price. Great value. The pizza was phenomenal as well as the extra crispy wing I ordered. I recommend it and will be returning soon.","BAD EXPERIENCED EVERRRR!!! never in my life have complained to any businesses but this Domino's Pizza have the bad service and take forever to have the order ready! took me about  1 hour and 45 minutes (or more) to have my order ready! and gave me attitude!!! what kind of service is thissss????? WOULD never come back here again! ever. . it deserve 0 star but no choice! anyhowwww, the foods are fine though. if you ever consider ordering pizza from this place. just call in and come pick up in 2 hours! many people were complaining and cancelled orders!!","Best pizza I've had in years!!! The dough is homemade, perfectly thin and the food was at our table 10 minutes after we ordered. Thumbs up!","Hmmm. It's smoking. . . Coal-fired pizza. . . sounds good. On the door, on the wall, on the menu. . . It says \" Our Pizza is Well Done. Look around, many pizza's with a somewhat burn crust. . . many smiling faces. The coal is anthracite so it is clean burning. . the oven gets really hot!. The decor is nice but mostly windows and a large square room with a long bar and lots of pictures mostly of local sports. A couple of beers on tap, bottle beers, wines and drinks are available. . A simple menu of pizza, salads, chicken wings and a couple of sandwiches. . Had the coal-fired chicken wings which come out crisp with caramelized onions. The onions were gooood but the wings were lacking flavor except for a little char flavor and a little salty tasting. The pizza was good with a burnt taste which gave it a subtle flavor of charcoal. . . not overly burnt. The crust is thin as you would expect for a fired oven pizza. Had Italian sausage as a topping and it was kind of sweet. . was hoping for a spicier flavor. . The hostess and waitress where very friendly and helpful.","Napoli tries to put itself into the famous Pittsburgh pizza competition against Aiello's and Mineo's, but it falls short, save one standard: it looks damn good. In the end, however, it will always place as shameful, shameful bronze. Here's what is best about Napoli: its cheese, which tastes exactly the same as the other two (same cheese seller?), and the crust is chewy, too. But the sauce is rather flavorless, though a little sweet. . Don't get me wrong. This excellent pizza, and it destroys 95% of all other pizza in the universe. But in Pittsburgh, it only wins the consolation match.","Delicious pizza. Friendly team. Just off the Fremont st experience inside the doors of the Plaza you'll find this outstanding pizza stop. Away from the craziness. Very convenient, late hours and you can even call in your order. The seating area is not all that quaint since it litterally in the lobby of the casino but the Buzz of the machines and tables doesn't really bother you. Very simple cafe but the pizza is fantastic. Enjoy.","IM USUALLY NOT THIS KIND OF GUY BUT SOMETIMES A BUSINESS DESERVES TO BE PUBLICLY SLAMMED FOR A SOLID PATTERN INCOMPETENCE. . . There isn't a -4 rating??? So I ordered 5 deep dish pizzas, 2 cheese and 3 pepperoni. . . pretty simple right? Hard to really screw that up I would think? . I don't know how hard it is to actually take an order and see it through because I've never worked there but I think it would be easy with computers n stuff, or a pen and paper idk maybe it is a hard job. . ? . Anyway I had someone go pick the order up, he didn't know exactly what I ordered but when he came back I ended up with 4 pepperoni pizzas and 1 cheese. . . . ****This has been FIVE TIMES IN A ROW THEY HAVE COMPLETELY GIVIN ME A DIFFERENT ORDER I HOPE THE WORLD SEES THIS AND AVOIDS THE PLACE, drive down the road a bit further and go to another Ceasars, trust me it's worth the gas****. So that's that, ya lost a customer obviously ya don't care because the last two times I got the wrong order I brought it to their attention but yet you all STILL manage to keep a strong track record of screwing up the most important part, THE ORDER!","Pizza is ok. . . Sauce is not good. . . Very clean eat in dining, beware of signs everywhere telling you your on camera. . . Guys behind counter don't smile, and aren't Italian. . . They have a \"version\" of NY pizza, and a very large pie. . . Price is ok!","After Toby Keith's refused to seat us, because their server was late to work, we wakled over to Flour &amp; Barley and had some of the best pizza we have had in Vegas. We are locals &amp; have tried several different pizza joints, this one just moved into the number 1 slot. We shared two pizzas, one with red sauce, arugula &amp; some kind of tasty italian meat (can't remember what it was called, ) and one with the creamy garlic sauce, chicken &amp; asparagus. Both pizzas  were delicious! We will definitely be taking our friends &amp; family here, in the future.","Levetto is a fabulous casual eats restaurant just north of Kensington. They have a nice focused menu offering Italian food at reasonable prices. I had the peking duck pizza and my friend had a carbonara. Both were well cooked and seasoned. I loved the flavour in the Peking Duck Pizza with crispy duck skin and duck meat. The tomato sauce was replaced by a sweet and salty glaze. Overall a mouthwatering dish. . We shared a tiramisu for dessert which was less appetizing. They used madelines soaked in espresso however we found that the madelines were actually frozen not fresh and they hadn't been fully defrosted prior to being served to us. It was disappointing to say the least. . Overall would definitely go back for the mains but maybe hold off on the dessert.","I love Levettos, the pizzas and pastas are so gud. It tastes healthy, not sure if it is. . . Like that feeling of \"yo I ate some aesthetic health stuff\" kind of feeling? In pizza form? and it's, yes. Just, yes. . You have to order up front but that's no problem because it's not a big restaurant. . The servers were super friendly. . If only my house was planted right next to levettos. . Yea I love it here.","I just tried to order a pizza for delivery and got a phone call from the general manager saying that they don't deliver to where I live in DeForest. Except they delivered to my house within the last two weeks!  The manager argued with me saying they never have and told me they don't have record of any orders from my phone number, which I updated when I last ordered online and on their delivery map my address is included. He basically called me a liar to my face, even though the pizza box from their last delivery to my house is still in the garage waiting to go out with the recycling. If you changed your coverage area fine, but don't be a jerk to a customer and call them a liar. I have a medical degree and am not some confused idiot. Then I got an email saying that my order was being made. The manager said that they don't deal with online stuff in their store. Someone needs to get on the same page and be consistent. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I've experienced in years!  I will never order from this franchise nor any other in the area and will be sure to pass along to my friends how they treat customers. I was so excited to find out they delivered here only to be disappointed. It's a shame too, because their gluten free pizza was pretty good. Save yourself the grief and go to Salvatore's Tomato Pie's instead. Way better pizza and way nicer people!!!","I love this theatre! . I live 10 minutes away from this theatre, so it's extremely convenient. . I absolutely love the $5 movies on Tuesdays (all movies are $5 at any time of day on Tuesday). The $5 movies are a great incentive to take time and relax during a busy school/work week. . The staff is very friendly, they have a great selection of concessions (ice cream, popcorn, pizza, nachos, literally EVERY non-alcoholic drink you could imagine) and the stadium seating ensures you'll never get a bad seat. . It's never too crowded when I go, which is another plus compared to the theatre at Town Square.","So we came here for my nephew's 25 surprise birthday party. There were a LOT of us, probably 35 or more including a half dozen under age 10. Big family plus friends. We pretty much took over the whole back patio and were waited on by the super awesome Ebony and Mango (yes, their real names, and they were amazing). These poor ladies not only had almost 2 score people on the patio, with at least 8 separate checks, but had tables inside as well. Yes, they had help from food runners, bussers, and a very competent manager, but they did the brunt of the work. They did it extremely well. . The whole scene was chaos, with people arriving at different times and trying to find seats while saying hello to everyone. The entire time, Ebony and Mango were on top of drinks, appetizers, pre-orders, split up family checks, you name it. Refills, add-ons, \"oh, can I get a whatever\"! On. The. Ball. . The food was really, really good! Go for the garlic cheese bread. I got the Italian beef sandwich and was blown away. I tried several different versions of their pizza and was never disappointed. I even stole a bite of my niece's spaghetti when she wasn't looking and was impressed. I wish I had room for dessert!. Look, I've had lots of Italian food in my life. Good Italian food isn't that hard to find if you are diligent and know where to look. I've worked in 4 different Italian places over the last 30 years. What I haven't found is a place that could accommodate 35-40 people all coming in at different times, at least 8 maybe 10 separate checks, and provide such an excellent experience. Kudos to your extraordinary team!. Special thanks to Ebony and Mango! You were the best! I sincerely hope everyone tipped you like crazy because you deserved it!. Get the garlic cheese bread!","Four stars for food and service, the beer production is a different story . Personally I do not enjoy local micro breweries. It seems like the U. S. Just figured out that you can add actual flavor to beers, and brew masters are going overboard . . The RRBC is a fun local brewery with a great menu and experienced staff . ( the high school hostesses can be bitchy and seem annoyed by customers) . I have been going here a little over three years, and overall it is a fun experience ! . Different daily specials are reasonable and well prepared . My favorite specials are the bucket wing night, 5$ pizza, and the 12$ steak and beer night. Also the burgers, soups, appetizers, and dinner plates have never disappointed me . . The patio during the summer time is fun, and adds more seating! Definitely anticipate a large crowd during weekend dinner times and any popular sporting events. . Like I said, the beer making is the weakest aspect. It is not bad, but also not good . Hope to see improvements for the future.","I looooovvvveeee this place! Our go to pizza for sure. Try the meatball pizza is amazing as well as a good ol pep and sausage!","Customer service from the order taker and driver were decent, but this place serves really, really terrible food. I should have known, but I was drawn by what I thought was an awesome coupon deal. You know how you order delivery, and the food smells good? That's not the case here. It reeked of onions. . The pizza was undercooked and bare. I had the Supreme which was overloaded with diced raw onions and barely had any other toppings. Also, I never thought anyone could screw up Buffalo wings. It's just fried wings with buffalo sauce, but they couldn't even do that. The wings looked unsauced and when I asked the driver about it, he was confident that the sauce was there. After a closer inspection I understood, and it was right then and there that I realized their idea of buffalo sauce is lightly dyed grease. Besides a very faint smidge of color in the grease, there was no hint of buffalo at all. The wings were really old, as if they were reheated and chilled several times. That was most likely the case. I tossed them away fearing food poisoning in my near future. . I am hoping I can stomach the rest of my pizza after reheating it myself. I wish I could get a refund, but I don't want to put up a fight just to hear that they won't provide one. Potential customers, please do yourself a favor and stay clear; the only valuable thing you'd be ordering here is a life lesson.","Unfortunately, this place could not live up to the hype created. The cheese bread was fine but nothing to write home about. You should not go here when you are very hungry because the pizza takes about 45 min to an hour to prepare. Sadly, there was a mistake in the kitchen with our pizza and we waited for 1 1/2 hour for our pizza to be prepared properly. This would have been forgivable if the pizza lived up to my expectations. It did not. It was not even edible. The only saving grace at this place was the staff. Everyone was pleasant and that means a lot. Although, I'm doubtful the friendly service was enough for me to try again. Very disappointing.","This place just opened, and so far so good. The usual pizza shop choices including subs/sandwiches, salads, pastas, and wings. I've played it safe on the few times I've been there and just got basic pepperoni / sausage. You have your choice of their traditional crust or deep dish.  (I hear you can get NY style if you ask). The crust was ok. The sauce a little sweet, but well seasoned. The pepperoni and sausage was of good quality. Overall, a pretty good pizza that's worth trying again. I little pricey, but the normal coupon discounts can be found. . The have a great assortment of specialty pizzas that I will have to try. For instance, the FatBob has garlic butter, red skin mashed potatoes, bacon, red onion and cheddar cheese. Next on my list. . Has a number of tables and booth available for dining in. The place is decorated with Harley Davidson mementos (hence the FatBob name). Also has a convenient drive thru window, in case you worried about burning off too many calories on the ten steps to the door.","I went to SkyZone for the first time last week as part of a company event. I really did not know what to expect, but it ended up being a whole lot of fun! . . . and a whole lot of aching for the next two days. ;). It was that night when we had the bad rain/storm storm so half our party was late, but the staff were quite accommodating. We still got our full hour, even though we started half an hour late. . One of the staff was always with us. He explained all the rules and also acted as a referee during our dodgeball games. He was nice and friendly. . Honestly, I did not realize how tiring trampolining is until I stepped onto the trampoline, and then adding dodgeball to that intensifies the amount of energy you need in order to play. . . for a whole hour. But it was really fun! It gets really tiring, but I kept wanting to play because it's not every day you can play dodgeball on a trampoline. . Afterward, we had some pop and pizza for dinner at the facility, as part of the company event. The pop tasted watered down and the pizzas were most likely frozen pizzas. It is okay if you are with a big group (of kids in particular) and you do not want to leave the facility to eat at a nearby restaurant (such as Pizza Hut), but I personally would not organize any sort of meal at SkyZone. . We will definitely be coming back for trampoline dodgeball though!","The pizza at the original Monical's were excellent and the staff was great to us good service. We will be back to the original Monical's again.","Really nice place. The staff was great - very nice and knowledgeable. . The flat breadsticks - more flatbread than big puffy breadsticks - were really tasty - and the dipping sauce was excellent. . My wife had a pizza - which uses the same crust and sauce as the bread sticks, and she loved it. . I had the Tortelloni - big tortellinis with prosciutto and a creamy (but not too creamy) gorganzolla sauce. Very much recommend if you like that sort of thing. . My son (11 years old) tried the swordfish and enjoyed it - I had a taste and thought it was good - not great - but I'm not a big fish person. . We all loved the sweet potato tots - awesome little things. Hard to keep myself from eating them. . The only negative was the cannoli for dessert - I didn't have one, but my wife and son were not impressed. . The place was not super fast at getting us our meal, but I don't mind a little wait. This is not Olive Garden where they crank out so much stuff. . Very much recommend. The staff was super friendly - offered suggestions - they even offered to let my son substitute his salad (he hates his greens) for something else without us even asking. . Will definitely be back.","The coffee is nothing special and the pizza is like eating dry flavorless cardboard. The older guy behind the bar is an A. H. , never smiles and is quit rude. McDonald's at least gives you a smile and has decent coffee. I'll go to St Clair if I want a good coffee served p[politely.","Tried the pizza for the first time today, I was expecting NY style pizza which it was not. Was with some co-workers, one of the girls asked for the soup of the day as mentioned on the menu, they didn't have one, asked for the free passion bread when dinning in, as mentioned on the menu, they didn't have any because the manager wasn't there and the cooks don't listen to the waiters/waitresses we were told. Overall it was ok.","Have always loved Little Ceasars. Disturbing though when an employee has his girlfriend drop him off Barro's pizza in the lobby in front of customers.","Divey bar right next to CMU, cheap pitchers, dart board, good pizzas, what's more to ask. . Sometimes go on fridays for a cheap drink. Kinda smokey so your clothes might smell weird afterwards. It's good with large groups, they have a jukebox as well.","place is ok, nothing i would go crazy for but something convenient when looking for something to eat. they have a pizza by the slice if you ever want. came in during happy hour which is probably the better option since prices are way better. got ourselves the pepporoni and mozzarella pizza. thin slices, nice and lite and crispy. not overly heavy or making you feel like crap. good portions. size is like a medium cut into 4 pieces. also got the garlic breads, they were ok nothing crazy. chicken wings were good a little hint of spice on them. my parents and i thought the place was ok. wasnt the best pizza they had but for the price during happy hour it was worth it.","Very pleased with the friendly service and food. Was a very quiet and calm atmosphere, the staff couldn't have been nicer. The food was just great!!  Great selection, yummy mashed potatoes, pizza really good, menudo, pisole, good desert section, good salad, nice selection overrall of home cooked tasting food. My only complaint was the tamales weren't fully cooked, the massa was raw, and the ham didn't taste good to me. But everything else was really really good. Nice selection, again the staff was very friendly, they didn't charge extra for drinks. Will definitely be returning!!","I'm from Chicago and have been living in Arizona for a year. I've tried several pizza places claiming to have Chicago's best but I was always disappointed, that's until I tried Vito's. This is by far the best place I've had in Arizona.","We've taken so many of our friends to Joe's and they love it just as much as we do. Their menu is pretty simple but that's the way to do it. Our favorites are the grilled pizzas: both the BBQ chicken and the Veggie. The line can be unreal sometimes but it usually goes pretty quick. The food is great, the reason for the 4 stars is sometimes the staff can be a little unresponsive or flat out ignore you until you say excuse me. This has generally happened when we do takeout and I go straight to the pick up counter. Overall, great place to dine.","after ordering two soups and a small cheese pizza and spending 35 dollars my order arrives and I get soup and an everything pizza ? I call and tell them they sent the wrong order they apologize and say they will send the correct order right now do after an hour I call and they say that the phone person that took my order left for the night and forgot to put the order in. . . then got a little nasty as I was up set them sent another pizza 30 minuteslater. . . 3 hrs for a pizza and the soup was very salty to the point that I wished I opened a can of soup . . . go else were. . . I guess I didn't learn my lesson","Such a cool place across from the city hall. I had my first and best green mac &amp; cheese at bannock. I forgot what made it green. All I know is that I ate everything to the last noodle and that does not happen very often. You just keep eating it wondering why why why is it green and why why is it giving the flavour. But I tell you it is addictive. It looks a little green, but don't be afraid, you will like it. Not overly cheesy or salty. Moving onto another oddity, I had today's special. Korean pork belly pizza. I am not sure how these two go together and really wasn't expecting anything. But wow the the pork belly was tender and flavourful on a think crust. I ate two slices on top of my bowl of mac &amp; cheese. So this says it all. I am not sure how Korean the flavour is, I can taste soy sauce for sure, but it was a good balance of sweet, salty and fatty. I very much enjoyed my meal and the reasonable dinner price. On the other hand, their coffee is not really good so I took off one star.","Dominos has been much better in recent years. Prices, like at all pizza parlors, could be better but the food is well made and good quality. Delivery time is reasonable and the online order tracker is useful for us impatient types.","Super nice staff and the food was great will definitely come here more often ! The only reason i haven't heard of this place before was due to it being hidden but other then that all positive feedback on this location! I had the Nutella crape it was very good next time I'm curious to try the pizza crepe !","I've never been to a pizza place like this one. . . It was restaurant quality food served in a casual self serve type place. Almost like a wildflower bread company meets a humble pie restaurant. You stand in line to order your food and your food is served to you. However u get to pick where you sit and had to fill and refill your drinks by yourself. The food was great, high quality and served quickly. Will definitely return!","Tried it today. This pizza did not hold up to the reviews on here. Bitondo is better and it's close enough to Fresca. This is not New York pizza. If you go there with this expectation you will be disappointed. Pizza Nova is better too.","Joe's Farm Grill is great with tasty burgers, gourmet hot dogs, pizzas, salads and sandwiches. I have had several items on the menu and all have been very good not quite 5 star delicious but above average for sure. I really like the 4B burger with bacon, blue cheese and barbecue sauce. My wife loves the buffalo chicken sandwich grilled and fried depending on the desired healthy eating. I have had the Sonaran hot dog and it is very good not quite as amazing as the el guerra canela Sonoran but easier to get to than Tucson. Overall good food and a great outside eating area for large groups and families.","This place has changed our lives. Seriously! . My wife and I live in Observatory Hill and I adore this neighborhood. Right on Riverview Park, quiet, beautiful historic homes, and close to everything. The only thing this neighborhood is lacking, in my opinion, is more restaurants. Sure, there are acceptable dining options 5-10 minutes away in every direction. But some times you just want fast, delicious and convenient. And to not leave the house. Until recently there was only one pizza place that would deliver to our house. One. And it's downright nasty. Right next door to the high school so that's the crowd they cater too. I'm guessing you can set your standards pretty darn low when your only competition is the school cafeteria pizza. . Then, one glorious day, a menu appeared on our doorstep. Riviera Pizza and Pasta. And they deliver to our home. Worth a try! They have all of the typical offerings, breadsticks, pizza, calzones, hoagies. You know what a pizza place has. What they have that I've never encountered before is a relationship with eat24, an app that allows me to order on my iPad and magically have pizza show up at my house. Whaaaaatt?!?! I can order pizza and never have to speak to another human, and the food will come to me while I'm in my pajamas?!? Finally!! All of my dreams are coming true! It's finally a civilized neighborhood thanks to Riviera!. The food is a solid 3. 5 stars. The pizza is pretty good. It's tasty, cheesy, and just the right amount of greasy. The breadsticks are super yummy and we get them every time we order. We like the calzones a lot, the small one is enough for 3 servings at least. The delivery has always been faster than the quoted time and the drivers are kind and courteous. We've been desperate for a neighborhood pizza place that we actually like. Finally, the storm clouds have parted and Riviera Pizza has emerged. And we are certainly some grateful fans!","I was impressed with the service and the family owned feel of the place. The pizza. Not so much. I agree with other reviewers that it is far too saucy. And not in a good way! And that the sauce is indeed too salty. We only ordered one pie and it was really, extremely filling. The boy and I only had a slice each and split another. . I will most definitely be back to try some other things on the menu though. I am sure that there will be something I like.","Great location, excellent service, and great pizza. The parking lot is kinda small and crowded so during the busier times it's hard to find a parking spot but the location is perfect. The store is spacious and clean. There are always fresh pizzas and they're organized! The staff are super friendly and nice. I went during thats amour day and even tho the store was super busy with double lines out of the store, I was only in line for about 5-8 mins. They were organized and had everything prepared. Great to see how quick and organized they were. Pizza tasted amazing as well and usually the temperature of the slices are good but since they were giving out medium pizzas for a cheaper price they made pizzas before so it wasn't has fresh or warm as I wanted. But totally understandable.","Came here for my cousins birthday. . . . OK first its in the Mandalay bay hotel so its pretty loud out there. Next the place is really nice, it has a pretty cool decor that reminded me of little italy. . So first off the waiter sucked so that means that our service sucked big time. We ordered ice teas and he brought it out like 15 minutes after we ordered it. I had to remind the waiter about our ice teas!!!. Food was bleh, it was not that good, . OK the pizza sauce was really sweet and it felt like i was eating pizza sauce with sugar. Oh and that huge chunk of mozzarella cheese in the middle made it perfect, ewww the cheese was just in one place. Ever thought of spreading it out????? . The only thing good here is the bread and butter and the tiramisu. . I do not think that I will be back  to this place.","This local joint (I live right up the street) is a welcome addition to the hood. Craftsy beers and cocktails, fun supper-club twist apps (fried smelt!) and awesome pizzas make this a great option for a girls night out or a quirky first date. The Pan Fried Bluegill BLT rocks - pimento cheese spread for god's sake!  Even the side of saut\u00e9ed green beans were yummy.","Yes, five stars. My son turned eight and Fat Cats did a great job with his party. Our party planner, Danielle, went over and above by serving drinks to our routy group of ten, making sure they all got their bowling shoes, and walking the lanes a few times to retrieve dead bowling balls. Facilities were beautiful, staff was accommodating, and the pizza was great!  Thanks, Fat Cats, for making this a memorable experience.","Don't expect to get a pizza around dinner time on a Friday. Ordered ours today at 6:30 pm was told 45 mins to an hour and it's 10 pm and still not here. Called at 7:45 asking where it was and was told its being delivered. Called again at 8:15 to find out it was never even sent out but will be the next one delivered. Clearly not the case. . . Hopefully I get it before tomorrow. If I could rate them a half star I would","Pomodoro e Tartufo Pizza - my death row meal. . Simplicity at it's finest, no tricks, no gimmicks, just simple ingredients that shine - thin crust, tomato sauce, truffled burrata, fresh basil, shaved black truffles. Perfection. . If I ever meet a woman as perfect as this pizza, I will marry her on the spot. . I'd love her so much I'd die for her. Scratch that, I'd kill for her. Con Air Nicholas Cage style circa 1997. . And sitting on death row, the only thing I'd look forward to is my weekly conjugal visit with my perfect wife and my last pizza. . It's ok, I'd die happy. . If you don't love this pizza, we would never be friends. . Everything else here is pretty awesome too - the pasta, salumi, desserts, drinks, service - all top notch. They push the nodini pretty hard but go for the gnocco fritto instead, your mouth will thank you. . I'd have Rob Gentile's baby for the culinary benefits.","We have been going to Phoenix for sometime now, but only recently learned of Joes Farm Grill. We tried it out, and let me tell you, it was awesome. Their portions were just right, and even though I was full when we left, I didn't feel gross like I do at other restaurants. I had the BBQ chicken pizza, and I loved it. Thin, flatbread crust made for a light pizza, very tasty pizza. My wife had the chicken Caesar salad. She gets that salad so often that she knows her Caesars, and she said this was her favorite dressing. And the chicken of course was amazing as well.","One of my favorite bars in Madison. Popular with 20-something's on the weekends. Huge horse shoe style bar with lots of standing room around the bar stools and some tables on the main floor. The unpairs is usually less crowded with plenty of booths for larger groups. The downstairs is truly a gem- old bank vault turned into lounge with swanky couch seating. There is also a small bar downstairs. Great drinks for decent price! I love their Moscow mules. Also their pizza is amazing!! And cheese curds are some of my favorite in town. Good weekday specials as well.","Restaurant update:. This continues to be a great fast food place for on-call cravings. It is great comfort food because it is essentially a pizza wrapped up into a yummy pocket. I have eaten here so much over the past 2 years that I have earned even free calzones from ordering online and earning points. Usually if you order online there is no issues with getting your order as you walk in. There is always ample cheese and other ingredients in the calazone and for the people complaining that it is dry, I have not had that experience after eating 15 calzones over the past year. There is so many to choose from!","Gluten free, lactose free, it's a menu you might want to check out if either of these appeal to you. . Voodoo Lounge is over on 16th Ave. I first heard of it when some local shows last summer, but I hadn't had a chance to venture in. Then, I had a best friend that decided it would be a good idea to move to Calgary, which has me on the lookout for gluten free and dairy free joints. Though I'm not sure if lactose free necessarily means dairy-free, Voodoo Lounge remains on my radar for three reasons:. 1) They make delicious pizza. I've had it on a few different occasions now. Must try: Acropolis. 2) 25 flavours of wings that are gluten-free. That's right! Just follow the little symbol next to the flavour. . 3) The kitchen is open until midnight. . . 7 nights a week. If you've got late night hunger, now you know where to go!. General tips: The tables are bolted to the floor. This scares me slightly, and makes me think I should be avoiding Voodoo on especially busy days. So, best time to pop in? For lunch or dinner on a weekday. Apparently they've also got a private party room in the basement. . Anyway, order the pizza. So far, that impresses me! Or. . . if you've got more dietary restrictions, try ordering from the salad bar! Add your choice of any free toppings starting at $8, then add chicken, steak, prawns, or Italian sausage for $3. 50 each. Yummy, yummy salad? I think so!. Enjoy!","We arrived in Montreal after an 8 hour car ride, tired and hungry. La Piazetta was the only restaurant within quick walking distance of our Airbnb that seemed like it had food our kids would eat, so we decided to give it a try. I'm so glad we did. It was delicious! We all loved our meals. Grown ups all got various pasta dishes, and everyone practically licked their plates clean. The pizza received rave reviews from two picky little girls. My lasagna was exceptional. The salted chocolate caramel dessert was OMG so good. The decor is fun and feels upscale without being too stuffy for kids. And the service was excellent too. Our waiter was friendly &amp; attentive but not overbearing. This place made our first night in Montreal a success!","First time trying it. We ordered a variety of things to try. Hawaiian, supreme  pizza and Stromboli were delicious but we weren't too fond of the garlic parmesan wings. Ordered extra crispy, but they were not done enough for our liking.","Large space. Would be great for a party. Pizza very reminiscent of Village Inn pizza-thin crunchy crust with nice amount of cheese and Italian sausage to make it chewy, tasty and filling. Gourmet pizza it is not. It was a Thursday night so I didn't expect a crowd, but I wasn't sure our waiter was on his A game. I hope they are able to fill the place up on weekends.","Great food - must be one of the best kept secrets in the burg!!  . Wings: Tasty and done just right. I got the dried Cajun. . tasty. I also tried hot  buffalo with parm on them (not on the menu) and they were pretty good too. . Stuffed banana pepper pizza (Village tavern pizza): this concept is genius!! ! It was the best pizza I have ever had. They make their own dough - everything is so fresh.  . Fresh cut French fries folks!!! They were really delicious! . Great service, it was clean and there is street parking or a parking lot practically across the street . . . . Bravo Village Tavern. . . . . Bravo !","I have dined here several times and always enjoy the experience! The cheese bread and margherita pizza are delicious. I had to deduct a star because, in the middle of our last meal, we were asked by the hostess to move to accommodate a large party . . . really? Regardless, I'll be back on my next visit!","Went to Scarborough location. Burnt garlic. Fake Italian food. Loud club music. Do not recommend to anyone with a taste bud or self respect. The Sunday sauce was not. The pizzas are not. The carbonara was oven bake. WTF. And to insult Carbonara even more it was served on Penne!  Go somewhere else.","Ordered from here just awhile ago as I was craving pizza for dinner and I saw some of the reviews about this place and about how good the wings and pizza are and I thought I'd give this place a shot today from the time I called in for the order there was kind of a miscommunication about what area to deliver the pizza at as they weren't sure about the address I gave them but it got fixed when I explained it to them. Also found out the most of the prices on the menu went up so they really need to update there menu so people who are new to ordering from a place like me will know and there regular customers will know also they told me it would be a 15 dollar delivery charge with my order which I think was ridiculous and highway robbery but companies will find away to get more money out of you one way or another. Now onto the food the driver delivers my food I pay him expect the change back and he's not sure what to give me back I think he knew just didn't want to come out of his pocket to give me the exact change but whatever I get my food pizza is really delicious probably not as good as some of the mom and pop pizza places I went to but for the quality you get it's good. The chicken wings were good a few wings were overcooked more then others but it was still good would love to try there fries but I might order them the next time I order from here overall with some of the positives and negatives I mentioned this place is not that bad and it might be better then some of the other different pizza places that I didn't have much of a good experience if they didn't charge as much as they did for the delivery charge this place and if some of the wings weren't overcooked and the other problem I mentioned with the delivery driver this place would easily get 5 stars from me but overall I see myself checking this place out again when I get a chance.","Superbe pizza au four \u00e0 bois grand vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de vin bon service je vous le recommande et prix abordable et tout le  personnelles est bien courtois.","The bar looked great and they had some rocking live music but it was too packed to get in to so we had to take a seat in the restaurant. The decor was nice and it was great that the doors opened up on to the patio. They should crack down on smokers right outside though because the smoke blowing in is like eating at a smokers house--gross! The drinks were ok. Nothing special and they featured a big like up of slushy drinks. I was hoping for a Manhattan or an Old Fashioned but they were not to be found. . My friend ordered off menu for a whisky sour but it came in a mason jar and looked radioactive yellow. I had a sangria which was good and a Hendricks with tonic (hard to mess that up). . The food was unimpressive. The thin crust pizza was disappointing with a soggy crust and light on the toppings. The risotto balls were dry and tasteless rather than the delicious cheesy molten goo I was hoping for and even the flavourful tomato sauce with chorizo and capers couldn't revive it. The only good thing about the food was how fast it came out. . The service was good and our server was friendly and accommodating.","The pizza is the best in town. You need to get the deep dish. The store isn't great looking. The bar is  like the Star Wars bar with odd the regulars are. The Empire in Newport and Ft. Mill are better restaurants however if you don't want to drive that far and just want great pizza this is your place.","Oakland has some good restaurants/places to eat, but I never knew about Pizza Sola until we went there after the semi-formal last Friday. I watched them eat that night (lol a dieting monster cannot eat at night, sadly), but the Sheep and I went to eat it the next day. It was last meal of him being a sheep. . Anyway, I think the allure of this place is that its NY-style pizza. I've heard that NY pizza is really really good, and we did try it once during my freshman year Thanksgiving break, but I was so starved by then I probably would have thought OE was amazing food. In general, I'm not a big fan of pizza (mostly because its crazy fattening) but we went anyway. . I wanted mushroom pizza (because I saw Julie order it the night before) but they didn't have any, so they gave me a cheese pizza with mushrooms added. The Sheep ordered pepperoni, of course. . So large that it doesn't fit on one plate!. The pizzas were so big that they were bigger than my face. I swear to god they were. I guess I liked it. Actually, I'm not sure what the difference between good pizza and bad pizza. I would have preferred the cheese to be meltier, but the crust as thin and light, not chewy as a rubber band. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. I probably wouldn't go again, but that's just me not liking pizza.","Very nice pasta and pizza. Got the beef rigatoni and a large pizza to share (forgot the name). The pizza was sooooooo good and crispy on the bottom, the cheese was perfect and toppings were generous. My fav has to be the pasta tho - the rigatoni was perfectly al dente and the sauce adhered to it so well. There was lot of beef and it was very tender and soft. Portion was very generous as well. I'm picky with my pasta and this one was probably one of the best I've had so far. Def coming back!!","High end pizza and psta bar. Nice ambience but not a big fan of open windows with flies roaming around. Pizza and pasta has great fresh ingredients but had to season with salt and pepper. Maybe just to my liking. Overall, good place to try but not something you will crave for. Servers are pretty green for a high end pizza place.","Ordered two pizzas Friday night (June 19th). They were delivered quickly, which was great. However, I bit into one of the pieces and pulled out a 4 inch piece of black hair. I proceeded to throw the rest of the pizza away. My husband called to tell them what we had found, indicating we didn't want another pizza delivered (because who would after finding hair?). Their response? An apology and then hung up. No offer of a refund or anything. Horrible! Back to Papa John's for our pizza from now on.","Worst pizza ever. . . . I was craving some pizza and since my regular pizza joint down the street was closed. . . I decided to try this one out. . . big big mistake. . Their bait there is. . . 2 cheese slices and a small ( kids) drink for $ 5. 99. I opted for to pay extra for one pepperoni slice and ended up paying 9 bucks. . . . . The pizza was a big soggy doughy mess with almost no cheese or toppings. It was about  80% dough, 10% sauce, 5% cheese and about 3 slices of pepperoni. I could barley choke it down. Ended up throwing most of it away. For having \"pizza\" in their name and that being the selling point of the place. . . I was very disappointed. . Never again. The restaurant was not very attractive . . . mirrors were dirty, tables hadn't been cleaned, trash cans were full and dirty, and the counters along the wall were also dirty.","Well, ordered pizza with black olives and pineapple. Came with black olives and pepperoni. Since I am a vegetarian that won't work. The salad was OK and cheesecake ok. Nothing special. Very sad excuse for a Streets of NY.","My new favorite pizza place!! Best pizza in the world! Better than NYC. Great drinks. Casual but fun! SO BOMB.","If you want enjoy a hand made tossed pizza this is the place. I'm a fan of pizzas and this one are so great. One of my favorites!!","Have been to Vegas a couple of times in the past year, and each time my girlfriend and I enjoyed checking out the City Center area and all it has to offer. We bought tickets to see the Cirque Du Soleil Zarkana show at Aria. After the show we stumbled upon Five50 nestled away in a back corner on the lobby level of the hotel. The restaurant received some good reviews on Yelp, so we decided to check it out. Now Five50 is our go-to pizza spot!. It is labeled as a \"casual pizza experience, \" but the ambience of the hotel and restaurant add to its charm. As you walk into the restaurant, there is a long counter that acts as an extension of the kitchen. Here you can place to go orders for pizza and other items. There are also tables just outside the restaurant where you can stand and eat your pizza for a quicker dining experience. The restaurant has definite character and personality. A long curved wall of wooden blocks stacked on top of each other separate the diners from the rest of the hotel/casino. Behind the restaurant is the sports book room where sports junkies can get their fix and gamble on events. There is a circular bar located in the center of the restaurant, along with tv's for your viewing pleasure. The service was a little hit and miss, but overall decent. . The menu offers eclectic pizza choices such as the truffle pizza (I would recommend this!), soups/salads, and pastas. The pizza is prepared fresh and cooked perfectly. Five50 offers a unique casual pizza experience with good food, and all the benefits of a Vegas establishment.","Decided to try Fatbob's Pizza during the holiday weekend. Pizza was very greasy, a sign that they are using cheap cheese. Sauce on the pizza was just average, didn't have much flavor to it. For the high prices that they charge, I expected better quality.  . Overall, I didn't like the pizza, can't recommend this place.","I live nearby and I'm so glad to welcome the former \"Dino's\" family back to the area!  Their food is so good and the pizza's are to die for. This is my \"go to\" Italian spot. . . great food and great service!","Stopped in here because I was craving pizza and was not disappointed. As an added bonus I had joined their rewards club and got 50% off my first pizza (any size)! . I ordered the much talked about margherita pizza and it was delicious! The real mozzarella cheese was centered on every piece and the tomato sauce was perfectly sweet, but not too sweet. It was a really great tasting pizza! The crust, though, was the highlight. I got the garlic butter and I don't think I've ever tasted anything so good in my whole life. Wow. Nicely salted and buttery with a crunchy, yet chewy crust. I almost could have wiped all the toppings off and still been completely satisfied. Yum!. I guess the four stars was because I didn't really get the punch I like from my first taste of a new pizza. Like I needed more of a intensity. Like another reviewer said (and I am completely paraphrasing) it's like Domino's on crack (totally paraphrased). . It was good, good, good pizza, the crust was the shining star and the fresh whole milk mozzarella was such a good taste along with the sauce, I guess I really did just feel like it should have been. . . more. . I'll be back, though, don't worry about that. It's some really good pizza!","4. 5 stars!. Excellent food. Top to bottom, the menu rocks. The pizza is of course top notch as many have said, but the pastas and salads are great too. I recently dined there with some vegetarian friends from out of town, and they were thrilled with the number and quality  of choices they had. The prices are very reasonable, and the service is efficient. I read a couple of reviews that rated the service so-so, but I think we all have different preferences in this regard. I'm not a big fan of the super-bubbly \"Hi I'm so-and-so, and I'm gonna be your server today, isn't that awesome?!\" style of service. I have always found the staff to be knowledgable, friendly, and efficient. . I go regularly, and they are usually able to accomodate for a table at the last minute, as they have a mix of daytime and nighttime clientelle, and seem to be steady and never super-busy.  . If you have questions about the food, or even just show an interest , someone from the kitchen will usually come out and chat. . This is not the place \"to see and be seen. \"   It is a very unpretentious place to have an excellent meal with excellent service.","I do not like writing about unpleasant experiences nor do I like giving one star. However. . . Ive had a pretty unpleasant experience here. While staying at the Aloft, I ordered Lago from the in room menu. By the time I got the food on my table, the cost was already double what I would have paid had I stepped down. Furthermore, the delivery guy lied to my face and told me that tip is separate from the already high delivery fees. . I ended up going down and speaking to the manager, who did give me the tip back that I paid on top of the room service fee and apologized for the issue. However, this totally ruined my experience and I would have expected the manager to go a little further than just getting me the money that was \"stolen\" from me and either comp the rest of the meal or offer a gift card of some sort to compensate for this horrific experience and the blatant lies of his staff, who deserve to be fired for incidents like this. . Outside of this specific incident, it would have been nice for them to note the applicable delivery fees on the aloft menu, which are ridiculously high. There wasn't a word about it. . Oh, and pizza was average at best.","The pizzas are pricey but good. The mushroom pizza is really good. . They have a good happy hour that we have been to a couple times. . I haven't had any wine here but they seem to have. A big selection. . Lots of outside seating, providing the weather is nice.","Driest pizza we've ever had on both their gluten free &amp; regular crusts, &amp; we consume ALOT of pizza. Premixed 'craft' cocktails, !!! Caesar slams, we asked if it was super anchoviey, waitress 'no', reality yes. . . . the place looks so great &amp; inviting, though uber disappointing.","Went to Sams Club yesterday at 7:28 to order a couple of pizzas and the guy behind the counter says he only has what's there. What? A big store like this out of pizza dough??? Really? I thought of running across the street to Winco and buying the pizza dough for them. I don't understand how they could run out. . . you would think at least give a coupon for $ off the next one for the inconvenience. I should have just gone Pizza Hut or anywhere else I suppose.","This is my favourite Holiday Inn so far! I have been here a few times now over the past few years and it's been as great each time. . The building itself is beautiful inside and they have a wonderful lobby area to just sit around and socialize and decent restaurant. I wasn't too fond of the pizza I had ordered. . . it was not too special. The complimentary breakfast however was AMAZING. Just as a note the breakfast might have been complimentary if it was added in the price package I got. I am not sure as I hear some people purchased the breakfast separately. The best hotel complimentary breakfast I've had. It was a buffet style breakfast with a lot. . . and I mean a lot of choices/variety. . The room was spacious and clean. No complaints here. We watched TV and surfed the Internet on their free WiFi with no issues. . Overall, I wish all Holiday Inns were like this. This is my go to stay whenever I visit Montreal!","Have you been waiting for Belfiore's to reopen? Forget it, they aren't, but Dino's has opened in its place!  We went there tonight and tried the pizza, salad, bread, ravioli, eggplant Parmesan and Veal Parmesan. . . . all were great. The service was friendly and prompt. The prices are very affordable. They have a bakery too. . The wait is over!","Pizza is good here whether you decide to go thin crust or stuffed pizza. . Pasta and salad are also good. We've gotten Alfredo the Dark pasta and Pablo Picasso Mexican Salad. . If you go stuffed pizza expect that a single pizza will feed more than you'd expect.","I absolutely love this place. The fries are served in a huge portion that would be good for two hungry people or three light snackers. I would recommend the pizza fries. The ice cream is some of the best I have ever had in Cleveland. The owner went to the ice cream school at Penn State, and let me tell you, whatever he paid for tuition was well worth it. Try the maple bacon and the french toast, both are incredible.","Rarely do I go out of my way to write a review. In this case, I MUST.  It seems that I am, more often than not, disappointed with some part of my meal wherever we go on our bi-weekly date night. I choose, in those cases, not to write a review because I'm concerned with hurting the restaurant. Maybe it was a bad night - who knows!  Tonight was different. . Valenti's has been opened for a mere 3. 5 weeks. That's right. However, they are running it like a restaurant that's been around for years. Valenti's is soon to become the neighborhood gem. . Our server, Amy, was a very attentive server and probably one of the best we've had in years compared to any restaurant we've visited. We started with the bread that was both crunchy on the outside and very chewy on the inside. With it came with two delicious dipping sauces. The artichoke spread was amazing and I made the comment that I would like a container to go because it was that good. Amy brought me a small container to go! (Thank you!!!!). Our appetizer was a lightly crusted calamari with a just right marinara sauce. The calamari was tender as it should be. . Hold on to your seats. . . My chosen entree was the special of  homemade ricotta gnocchi with sausage. Holy smokes this was some good stuff. If I had to make a suggestion, it would be to make it a touch spicier even though it really is good as is. My husband enjoyed a delicious margherita pizza which was baked perfectly. . The bottles of wine were well priced and we enjoyed a nice bottle of Hess for a mere $28. (Not bad for restaurant pricing. ). The owner, Milo, was out visiting with diners and he even took me back to the kitchen to show me the pastas were made every morning. . There is absolutely nothing I would complain about this particular date night. Eveything was perfect. . Valenti's will now be our neighborhood gem!. When going, ask for Amy as your server!","A great spot for our Friday night date night. We were seated right away at a table by the window. It was still happy hour and most drafts were half off. I tried e Shocktop Twisted Pretzel (kinda watery and flavorless) and my go to Leinenkugel Cranberry Ginge Shandy. My fianc\u00e9 had the Strongbow cider. Select apps were half off and we got the pretzel sticks and pierogies. Both were fabulous and left us too full for dinner. The pretzels are served with honey mustard and cheese. The pieogies have sauerkraut, kielbasa and onions on them topped with sour cream. We put in a to go order for our entrees and got a side salad, boneless wings and a flatbread pizza. The takeout did not stay good for long so  it would have been best to have just eaten the dinner there. Our fantastic waitress, Amanda, talked us into the pretzel brownie which was to die for - a fudge brownie with whipped cream, chocolate sauce and crushed up pretzels. A great dinner and we will be sure to be back.","This gourmet pizza joint is on par with Patsy Grimaldi's, i. e. a close second place to Pizzeria Bianco. How do you beat the national favorite? You dont. But that is still a HUGE compliment, as even a close comparison with PB is an honor, in my book. And, Humple pie is biting at the heels of Bianco, no doubt. I work close by, so maybe I'm partial but the pizza is fantastic. They have great variety and do all kinds well. Try the Margharita or Artichoke pizzas. The artichokes on the artichoke pizzas are huge chunks - no skimping here!. The lunch special and happy hour prices are both good deals. I ordered the cold Green Bean salad at happy hour ($3 i believe) and it was surprisingly delightful and refreshing. Puts a new perspective on \"salad. \". Also, the staff is ALWAYS friendly and helpful- even when slammed with the lunch crowd. Have yet to have a bad experience here!. I highly recommend it for a nice light lunch or dinner. Its yummy!","They have sort of weird business hours, but the pizza is great. Crust is on the thin side, and they put on a generous amount of cheese.","Buca is one for those restaurants you have to book a week in advance if you plan on eating dinner at a reasonable time (i. e. no one likes a hangry date at 9:30pm). . Reasons why I keep booking reservations: . The space has soaring ceilings and exposed brick walls. The wine list is extensive and the cocktail list (priced similarly to what to you can expect on King W. ) is not offensive by any means. The pork blood pasta is one of my favourite dishes ever - for real. The basil gelato is amazing. The service is attentive (if not bordering on overly so, at times). Your coworkers will be like \"Oh, you were at Buca? Sick. \". Reasons why I roll my eyes at the restaurant:. The nodoni are literally bread knots covered in some spice and olive oil - I don't get the hype, but maybe I've been conditioned by the media to hate gluten. Also, the waiter told us the tiramisu was the best in the whole city. . . I'm not saying this was necessarily fraudulent, but I wasn't convinced. . Reasons why I hate myself a little when I come:. Some of these dishes: (i) are definitely meant to be shared by more than 2 people . . . Eating half of a burrata pizza was one of the most gluttonous things I have ever done, and (ii) are insanely priced . . . To add \"preserves\" (literally like 3 pieces of pickled artichoke, a couple dabs of a savoury jam and a paint brush stroke of sauce) to your charcuterie, it cost $8. Never again. . Bottom line: try the pork blood pasta. It is spicy, and you will cry - not because of the heat though. Because it is literally that good.","I'm from Chicago so this pizza is as close to home as it gets. . but when you consistently get pizza delivered at work and home and the cheese is always sliding to one side of the pizza box tells you that they are consistent in making the same mistake over and over. . I work at a car dealer and we stopped ordering from them on Saturdays bc on a few occasions we got almost 10 or more pizzas delivered the same way I got my pizza delivered last night. . funny thing is I'm sitting at the bar having some beers while my wife and kids were at home when I got this pic. Bar service is always nice. April is awesome. . I just hate paying $30 for a thin crust and getting it delivered this way continuously . . .","What a great addition to downtown Pittsburgh! This place kills it. Working downtown we definitely have a lot of pizza options but I don't feel like we had affordable pizza options for 1 person. Sure you want a whole pizza for you and a few coworkers then you have plenty of options. But if you wanted a small, affordable pizza just for you the only option was v3. . A coworker and I went here one Friday for lunch and we were both blown away. The place itself is absolutely stunning. Everything on the menu sounds amazing so it's hard to just pick one. The first time I went I got a basic margherita pizza and it was amazing. I'm not a big crust eater but this place has the most amazing dough that I ate the crust. The pizza was not overpriced and it was definitely a good size. I have been telling everyone about this place ever since that day. If you haven't checked out Pizzuvio yet, you definitely need to.","Two words - POUTINE PIZZA.  Portions are very large especially their duck poutine pizza which is a must get. I also shared the benedict which came on a very large piece of flatbread so it was definitely an interesting take vs. the normal english muffin benedict but good nonetheless.  . The food was slightly dry but it was reasonably priced and service was very quick. Solid brunch spot but definitely more on the casual side (there was a cafe area where you could pick stuff up to go I think).","I chose to eat at their Peoria location even though I am on the complete opposite end of town in Phoenix. I was planning to be in the area and didn't want to drive home during rush hour. . I met a friend there and since it was HH we decided to start off with a pitcher of beer. I swear this was the largest pitcher I have ever ordered and it was a good thing I had someone who would have a glass with me. But there was no way we could finish the last of it. There was probably another 16 oz glass left. . We started off with an appetizer. Best bruschetta I ever have had. There had to be at least 2 inches of diced tomatoes on the top just perfectly seasoned. It would be a great appetizer for 4 people or just enough for 2 without ordering anything else. . We ordered a small pizza which would really feed 3 or 4 people. It was a deep dish with fresh mushrooms and pepperoni. There were 6 extra large slices in this pie. We each ended up taking home 2 pieces each. Now I have 2 more delicious meals. . I would really recommend just one or 2 extra toppings so that you get the taste of pizza rather than the toppings. . The only reason I did not give it 5 starts was the atmosphere. I remember the location in Chicago and the atmosphere inside which felt completely different here. . Since I am on the East Side of Phoenix I will try the PV location next and see if it is closer to what I remember from the Chicago location. But, all in all, I am ready to try the other location and the sooner the better.","Got 3 pizzas and antipasto salad delivered and it was excellent. The best part was the delivery guy was the most pleasant delivery person I've ever met. Food tastes better when the people who bring it to you are happy!","Good: I walked in and was greeted by the entire assembly line. . Bad: Everything else. Once they did their company policy greeting, they were real punks. I'll give the young guy an exception. He kept quiet and had to deal with his coworkers longer than I had to. When we ordered, we had a coupon, then asked if we could stack another coupon. They replied with \"No. Because you're already getting like $4 off anyways. \" Ok? Be more more of a smart butt next time, please. Then we ordered the pizza. We ordered a 5-meat stuffed pizza and I requested that they don't put cheddar on it, and instead use mozzarella. They were annoyed, then they took a pre made pizza, and literally scraped off the toppings with their hands right in front of us. . . . . yummy. . . Some additional comments:. * You're a pizza place. Pizza is Italian. It's literally an Italian sin to put cheddar cheese on a pizza. Stop with the cheddar cheese, non Italian \"pizza\" makers. . *And yes, I know how to turn the oven on. Thanks for asking and insulting my intelligence.","Just had a thin crust pepperoni and sausage pizza delivered. It is very flavorful and delicious! Skip the chain places and get Famous Yeti. It will be our new go to pizza place. So happy they delivered to us on the North side of Lake Kegonsa.","I guess being from Chicago I am a pizza snob. I wanted this pace to be good because it 2 mins from my house however, nothing but bad cheap. pizza. When the sausage tastes like mystery meat yu know there is a problem. Nothing home made here, all out of the freezer or a box. Someone stated they had the best cheese sticks ever, really? The best frozen deep fried cheese sticks? Much better options.","I thought being a privately owned pizza restaurant they'd have a good recipe. Sadly I was very disappointed. Paid $25 for a medium pizza and wings and that was with the special. The wings were in this kind of breading which was soggy and unfavorable. The pizza lacked much flavor and wasn't very good. Delivery was fairly timely, about 30 mins but then again it was also early Thursday evening. I probably won't be back. For that kind of money I'd rather go elsewhere and get more quality for my dollar.","Great pizza, great concept, quick service. . This place is great! This was my first experience with a pizza place using the order-at-the-counter concept like this, and I was thoroughly impressed. This particular location is nice and open. You order at the counter and can get pretty much whatever you'd want on your pizza or salad. I got a pizza and a small side salad to go with it. . You order your sauce, meats, veggies, and cheese at the counter. I didn't see anything limiting the number of toppings, but they did seem to be pretty careful about the amount of any particular topping that you get. There is a nice variety of everything, with many options for all of the sauces, meats, veggies, and cheeses. They put it all together in front of you, and then they throw it in the oven. Because the crusts are nice and thin, it only takes a few minutes for the pizzas to cook. We had our pizzas at our table before I even finished my small salad that I had taken back and started eating immediately after paying for the meal. . The pizza itself was great! I had put together a chicken pesto and veggies pizza that I really enjoyed. The thin crust had a great texture to it, and the toppings all had good flavor. Add some crushed red pepper to that, and you've got a great pizza. Because it was cooked fresh, it came out nice and hot, with cheese stretching from the slice to mouth with each bite. I ate the whole pizza and was pretty satisfied with the size. . The salad was tasty as well. It made for a nice starter, and considering the choices you have, it's well-priced. Between the salad and pizza, I was probably a little more full than I normally like, but nothing too uncomfortable. . This is a fantastic option for pizza by yourself or for pizza with choosy people who can't agree on toppings. Pretty darn good, and the price is certainly right.","Great customer service, delivery drivers are super friendly and polite-they answer all my very talkative children's questions with a smile. Pizza is hot upon delivery, every time, and we have not paid over $35 for two pizzas and garlic fingers. I love that you can choose the sauce and crust, and am absolutely a fan of the spicy sauce! They're our go-to for delivery pizza and I would recommend them to everyone I know.","Super quality game store with super awesome staff. This store really appeals to the tabletop gameplayers. The offer games workshop and other rare British tabletop games. Dungeons &amp; Dragons to magic the gathering and other random gaming stuff. I'm very excited about this addition to my part of town!! And it happens to be right next to pizzalicious which is another outstanding establishment.","Awesome coffee shop with a very friendly owner and really pleasant staff. . Delicious assortment of fresh baked muffins and treats. Extensive selection of coffee and tea. . With it was open a little later than 6 on Mon-Thurs. evenings  There is a variety of other food on the menu  - pizza and sandwiches. I haven't tried anything else, yet, but definitely plan to!","Very well done Humble Pie!. I had dinner here on Wednesday night and absolutely loved it. The salads are perfect, and the pizza is just incredible - wood fired with a lot of unique toppings (potato, clams, etc. ). The pizzas are the perfect size for two to share, and leave you just enough room to try their eclectic appetizers. . Beautiful atmosphere at night. I'm not sure how other reviewers are calling it casual? I haven't heard of too many 5-star pizzerias - this is about as nice as they come. . . It's definitely a pizzeria and wine bar, with lots of wine to choose from, and really a nice bar area for happy hour. . They also have a climate controlled patio which is gonna pay off in the summer. The chairs and stools may be the most comfortable my bum has landed on. . It's not the BEST pizza I have ever had - but it's damn close, and it's also damn close to my house :)","I tried Nook for the first time yesterday. It was wonderful! The service was great and I loved the persuttio pizza. I cant wait to go back!","I should of known when I saw the Kurt Warner marinara sauce that it was gonna be nasty. . . . I was right and we shared two of the \"guest favorites\" and they were nasty so I can just imagine what the other entrees tasted like. The people next to us had pizza which looked like maybe it was tasty but from the two items we chose its probably mediocre at best. . .","We wanted to like Luigi's. Had been looking forward to trying it out. We felt all but forgotten while there. With small kids, we order our food fast so ordered the drinks, appetizers and pizza at once. They were out of 2 of their 5 appetizers. Appetizer came out just fine but then didn't see the waiter for 30+ minutes until he came with the dessert menu. This is when we realized our pizza had not been made. After an hour of waiting, got our pizza and drinks refilled once (by then they were half full of water from the ice melting). Pizza was decent but not good enough to overcome the poor service.","Char Pizza is extremely well run and managed. The decor is upbeat and the service que is very efficient. We had prosciutto and fig pizza with arugula and balsamic dinner was very tasty. However, next time we will ask for extra char since the crust wasn't very crispy. Overall a very good dining experience. . one of the few gems in the area.","Great upscale italian restaruant serving authentic italian pizza. Great service. Great ambiance. Delicious house wine. Highly recommended!","its pricey but its worth every penny . ! amazing gourmet pizza and pasta, try their lamb chops , its soooooo good. !","Some of the BEST pizza in the area. You can get cheaper but this pizza is quality. Good for delivery but the restaurant/bar is nice as well. I've never had any problems other than it being filled with typical Bloomfield guys who sometimes make it awkward to be a female at a bar. The staff is nice though and again, the pizza in superb.","The jalape\u00f1o cocktail is excellent!  The chipotle shrimp appetizer was great and the kids liked the Tots. I don't recommend the tortilla soup though. Good chicken tenders &amp; cheese pizza for kids!  The waiter was very nice &amp; the atmosphere is comfortable/trendy/clean","I'm not going to lie, I was starving and that sometimes clouds my judgement. I also know that it was new year's even and on the cusp of getting very crowded but it was quiet at the time and hot pizza sounded like the perfect way to counter the cold. The service was unbelievably fast and friendly. It was so fast that if the food hadn't been really really good, I would have wondered if it was pre made or a day old. It was really really good and fresh so they were just that fast. The selection of artisan Italian sodas was a great touch (I wasn't drinking) and the portions were large and perfect for sharing. Would love to come back.","I really love this place. They have a nice staff and order their pizza every Friday &amp; hubby loves it! Good pizza guys thank u!!!","I love the main guy who works here. Everyone is nice but he makes my daughters day. It is by far the kids choice for pizza. You can get a slice which is great in a pinch. The zeppoles are a crowd please at work.","This restaurant has relocated to the lower level at Square One. . I used to love going here, but since the move, all I can say is, \"I won't be back!\". Half the good stuff they used to carry is gone. The pasta was way better upstairs!. Really gone down hill! . Won't be back again, ever. . With all the new choices around the Food Court, I know where I'll be going from now on!. BTW, the pizza slice I had today, because I was with others was terrible. Cold! Instead of tomato sauce it seemed more like a marinara sauce. Awful!. (UPDATE: my daughter was sick after eating the chicken . . . . . . . . . . Food poisoning???? Really, not good anymore!)","If you listen to 680 News I'm sure you've heard their ads on the radio talking about 50 flavours of wings and amazing pizza . . . this is what brought me in. . Placed a pick up order online and when I arrived to pick up was asked what I ordered even though they had a print out of the order. I repeated my order and was told they didn't have the wing flavour ordered that they only had hot and honey garlic. For somewhere that claims 50 flavours I found it disappointing that only 2 were available and wasn't called before I showed up to let me know this wasn't available. Another item ordered they didn't have and I had to wait for my pizza to be made. . The whole experience was bad and when I got home and opened everything up realized they forgot one thing I ordered. I emailed and called (no one answered) the customer service line and have not heard back yet. . I would not recommend this place to anyone and definitely will not be ordering from here again.","I am so happy Papa Murphy's came to our part of town! For newbies like me, they create the pizza in shop and you take it home and bake it. It is perfect for me and the boyfriend as they will make a pizza 3/4 pepperoni with no complaints leaving me happy with cheese and him happy with pepperoni. The staff is friendly. The coupons or deals are normally pretty good. It is more expensive than the Domino's $5 large, but I think the quality shows. Love being able to cook the pizza as long as I like. For fast food, I think Papa Murphy's is hard to beat.","We really liked this place! It kind of reminds me of a Buffalo Wild Wings set up- would be great for watching sports games. We brought a friend from out of town here for a few drinks and dinner. We ordered nachos as an appetizer, which were great. I had a pizza for lunch which was awesome. The beer selection and atmosphere were great! . We did order to go from here and used a coupon that came in the mail for pizza and wings for $19. 99. After I got the food home, I realized that they charged me $21. 98 before tax. Not a huge deal, but bothers me when you're giving them a coupon that clearly says $19. 99. Be sure if you are using their coupons, you double check your receipt before leaving the restaurant!","I love this place!  I've been going here since they were at their old location in Stow. I read some of the other reviews, and since they've moved, they serve you, and you don't get your own drinks/napkins/etc. I think the pizza and grinders are awesome, and the staff ( or at least the majority of the staff) is amazing!  I also love the drive-thru window for carryout orders as much as the great atmosphere inside. There's not a whole lot of food I'd rate a perfect 5-star rating, but I have no complaints here for sure.","Excellent Pizza!. I ordered from Eat24 App and received fresh pizza on time very easily. I got an X large Pizza w/ 4 toppings for $20 and tasted just right. First time I ordered pizza in Az that was affordable and up to my standards. I look forward to ordering again soon!","They've got amazing pizza dough for when you don't want to or don't have time to make your own. And I love their bread!","I would give one star but I felt our server and the pizza was great. The thing that threw us off is that we found a hair in our Brussels. We have no intention of getting over on the place but the manager said he inspected the hair and mentioned that none of the workers had that blond strand so maybe it was either my wife's, or it was flying and landed in it due to the ventilation. He didn't charge us for the dish, but he did make us feel uncomfortable like we had intention of getting over on the place, in which we didn't. I may give this place a second chance, of course with only the pizza and beer.","Ordered a thin crust pizza from here last night. Was hands down, one of the worst pizzas I have ever had. It tasted like cardboard. Was delivered before expected delivery time, but wasn't even close to warm. Did I mention it tasted like cardboard? Very disappointing.","tried this place on a whim with some friends during the lunch hour, and it was awesome. I had a veggie pizza and wasn't really expecting much, but it was actually better than the overly - hyped pizzas at cibos and pizzeria bianchi. the service was good, and the food came out fast. great lunch hour experience. highly recommend.","One of the best bargains in the Aria hotel, maybe Vegas. Pizza by the slice, with a few other dishes. The large slices are about $6-9. The menu is small but well executed. The pizza is excellent by any city's standards. Crisp crust with interesting mixes of cheese and toppings. The Forager with mushrooms (not button mushrooms) is my favorite. Good selection of craft beers and whiskeys at the bar. There is even a counter for Pizza to go.","Have you ever found yourself in the south-west end of Toronto (around Humber College on Lakeshore) late on a Saturday night (around midnight) looking for good, cheap eats? Well if pizza, \"Timmy's\"  and McD's won't satisfy, go Chinese, and try out Mai Mai Restaurant!. I discovered this humble little Chinese restaurant some time last year when I was coming off a shift at work and grabbing a meal for myself and a buddy. After that first visit, I was hooked and became a regular. The food is consistently great, I found the service is always friendly and appreciative, the delivery drivers are good too. . What you may think: the place looks run down, but it's clean and once you get over the looks, you'll discover that this is, hands down, the best Chinese food in the area.","Was the worst tasting pizza ever! Very bland. . . . . The ranch was so runny I was  wondering either they let it sit out or added water to cut the cost. The place smelled like sewer and there were bugs everywhere!","I first learned about Mangia &amp; Bevi when my friend introduced it as an \"awesome place with great food\" and made it the venue for his birthday dinner. What a true hidden gem! It was hard to find even when we literally had the address in our hands. However, the confusing layout was all but forgotten when we were finally inside, warmly greeted, and sat at a long, classy high top by bar. . The antipastos we shared were bountiful. The wine service was timely. Everyone's meals were reported to be delicious. I must admit that I didn't get a chance to try anyone else's dishes other than a slice of thin and tasty pizza, but my Commendatore pasta featuring sausage, smoked provolone, spinach, pistachio, and cream was so good that I found myself getting a little protective when I could feel other people's eyes on it. . With such delightfully executed food and service at such reasonable prices, M&amp;B is the perfect example of how curiosity might get you into the door at least once elsewhere, but that only a great experience like this will have you coming back time and again. I can hardly wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.","Way too expensive for mediocre pizza and small portioned food. Sorry, but you can spend your money elsewhere.","Great place for lunch downtown. Fresh sandwiches, salads, and fantastic flatbread pizzas. Also have cold Izze's on hand, which I have been addicted to lately. Not a lot of places to sit, so plan on taking it back to your desk.","I've visited a lot. I came before they expanded the inside portion. I love what they've changed. More indoor seating, staff bring you you're food, nicer dinnerware, and tractor soda bar inside (no more bees yay). I've tried many of their burgers and they're okay--others really enjoy them. I personally go for the garlic fries and the REAL milkshakes. Seriously two best menu items. The garlic fries leave you stinky, but definitely satisfied. The milkshakes are the size of an adult forearm and come fully equipped with whipped cream and cherry and are so worth the $5. 50. I always get strawberry--which is made with real strawberries not the fake stuff like other places. The atmosphere is friendly and inviting and great for families. Watch out on Friday's, as you will be greeted with a line out the door because they're that good. I recently tried the buffalo chicken sandwich and found a new favorite! Perfect balance of grill flavor and spice. Next time I hope to try their pizza. You won't be disappointed here. When it's cooler, enjoy the beautiful grounds outside. The story behind this place is very magical, too so don't forget to watch the story on the tv while you wait in the line to order.","Nonexistent service. Once we sat down and ordered 2 beers it took 30 minutes. Same to just get water. Ordered food and it took nearly an hour. Once it came out the chicken wings were burnt and the pizza fries were soggy. Had to ask several times for silverware. . The table next to us totally left without paying their tab because it was impossible to get service. The waitress would disappear in the back and rarely emerge. When she did she would do a quick lap around the dining room without stopping and go back into the kitchen. . . . Another table that had come in and sat down left after about 20 minutes due to being completely ignored. No drinks, nada. . This is a bummer because this place had potential to be a good local spot, but the service is so so so so bad. We will never be back. No matter, there are plenty of other places to go nearby.","The next best thing to come to fast casual. Build your own pizza before your very eyes and it's ready in less than 10 minutes. Go hungry and eat at the restaurant. It's made fresh and meant to be eaten as such, not the same the second time around.","This place was decent for brick oven pizza. The price is decent and the pizza is decent size so can be shared between two to three people depending on how hungry you are. The pizza itself was average. The pizza was very fresh, but the crust tasted a little funny. The garlic bread was okay as well but not a very strong taste. There were other appetizers like meat and cheese trays that looked very good I wish we would have tried instead. Overall though if you are craving a healthier pizza option that won't break the bank this would be worth trying!","No more Dennys, but the Station Casino group has modernized the old cafe.  . The food is still Station Casino stuff, but the interior upgrades gave it a like more pizzazz, and the number of flat screen throughout the cafe won't let you miss a beat if you're watching ESPN. . Station has cutback on the wait help, but lucky for them, there a was great Cuban waitress who was serving eight different table, and was even busing them too. I was very surprised because she was on top of of each customer, and none of the tables had no noticeable problems with her service. Because of this waitress, I'm adding a star to this review.","I really like to come here with a friend. We split the goat cheese pesto pizza and a soup and salad. The service is always excellent. The reason for my 3 star review is that their food has been hit or miss in my opinion. Before I found my \"favorite\" I tried a number of plates that I was not wow'd by. I remember some of the plates having veggies that were undercooked, or just not my favorite.","I wouldn't give this place one star if I had a choice too they are the most rude people I've ever delt with there pizzas are gross. They are very soggy dough is never fresh. I went a couple of times a week and the cook is always outside smoking cigarettes and when he goes back in doesn't even bother washing his hands before he makes my pizza. I will never eat there again in my life couple days later I had the stomach flu from eating there food I suggest you do not eat there at all.","Went today with intentions to have a beer with my husband and ended up ordering their wings. . . Let me say that they were AMAZING!  Not traditional at all but so delicious!!!! Can't wait to go back and try their pizza!! Oh and our beer was $1. 50!!!!","The pizzas are made to order with fresh ingredients. Their 900 degree oven makes the pizzas in 90 seconds - hence their name. The atmosphere is laid back and we witnessed many people picking up their pizzas to go. . Now the food: The crust is thin and light and easy to cut. My partner ordered from the Pizze Bianche menu and got the Toscano pizza made with house mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, roasted peppers, roasted onions, garlic, and basil. I ordered from the Pizze Rosse menu and got the Caserta pizza made with salame, roasted peppers, roasted onion and oregano. Both were popping with flavor and did resemble the pizza in Italy. Since the pizza is thin, you don't get a stomach ache after finishing off the entire personal pizza. . I think the next time we will try their mozzarella bar or paninis! And don't forget the Vino!!","I didn't listen to some of the negative reviews and tried this place out for myself and I wasn't disappointed! I got the garlic bread and a pizza and it was perfect for two people. Everything was delicious and the service was some of the best I've experienced in Vegas. Also, they have an impressive beer selection! Check this place out!","Let me start off and tell you that I loved this little restaurant. Book a table before you go as they have only a small amount of inside tables. I was taking my wife and mom out for a nice dinner but not too fancy. I personally prefer restaurants that have character, this place has that. They were quite busy and luckily we got the last booth by the door, again wish we booked ahead of time. A lot of people shod up right after us and they were unable to get a table. I had the wood fired pizza and it was good, Mom had the seafood risotto and that was amazing. Will definitely go back again. . .","Mineo's did not cut it for me so I decided to give Aiello's a try and I'm glad I did because it was so much better. I wont ever crave it but at least the cheese and sauce are good and it's not super greasy like Mineo's. I'm still looking for that slice of pizza that makes me want more. . Don't know if I will ever find it here but I must continue my search.","This is the closest a pizza I've had in America comes to the Italian original. And I've had Italian pizza in Italy many times. The pizzas are completely reasonably priced. Wood fired oven, perfect crispness, not too much cheese, freshly made sauce, thick high quality pepperoni. Never too many ingredients at once, never too much bread. AMAZING!. Also the dessert gelato is legit. You can even order straight up flatbread, if that's your thing. It just does not get better in terms of quality and price. I'm going to make it a point to go here every time I'm in the area.","I have mixed reviews of this place. It's obviously run by kids off for the summer and or a part time job because every time I call I get a prompt answer and half way through my order the person says \"hold on\" a bunch of laughing, then I have to repeat my order. The slotted time for delivery is ALWAYS 45min - 1hr. Today, it arrived within 20 min and the pizza was not cooked thoroughly. The top was fine, the rest was spongy and like wet! . Just know what to expect when calling and don't do anything while waiting because it could show up 20-40 min early.","Great atmosphere, which is deceiving from the outside. The staff was very friendly and attentive, but the menu was a little disappointing. They have plenty of burgers or pizzas, but not much else. Definitely not a lot of options if you're looking to eat a little healthier. That being said, I tried the mesquite chicken sandwich (it was the only non-beef sandwich), and it was delicious. The sweet potato fries were made perfectly. . . not too soggy, not too crunchy.","I've been here a couple times and will continue to come back, because it's just one of those fallback places. When I can't decide where to go, this one's always on the shortlist due to its charming atmosphere and good price-quality ratio. . The pumpkin ravioli is indeed good, but very rich and heavy. I would reserve it for a cold, cozy night in. The pizza isn't bad either. I have heard raves about the pecan chicken but have yet to try it. . I am also indebted to the wait staff at this place, as my last outing here was a bit of a rowdy one with my drink-happy girlfriends. Good thing this isn't the type of place that frowns upon such unladylike behaviour.","Food and service are great. Wide variety of pizza, salads, and pasta. My favorite pizza is Fran's Favorite. The wings are great too. I also recommend the Greek salad. It's a little on the pricey side, a few drinks and a  pizza  will run you about $40 for two. But I do love the great food, ambiance and friendly service.","My favorite pizza in the valley. Been eating here over 10 years. Stop calling pizza franchises and call a long-standing local pizza spot like Manhattan Pizza. Never disappoints!","Popped in for pasta last night. The pizza is always good but I wanted to try something else. The penne with meatballs was huge and very reasonably priced. The cheesy garlic bread at 1. 49 was also a deal! Fast service, huge portions and good prices. Nice neighborhood restaurant!","I sat outside so I didn't pay attention to the decor, but I thought the pizza was top notch. Crust was great and the unique combinations of pies were a welcome to our family. There is so much blah pizza these days that this place definitely stood out to my tastes.","One of the best pizzas I have ever eaten in my life. The atmosphere was so quaint and fun that it made our time there even more special. We went right around 11am and there's wasn't a huge crowd and our pizza and panini came out very quickly. . The pizza itself was so delish! Soft AND crispy crust, the toppings melted together beautifully and the sauce was finger lickin good! . If you're in the Middleton area GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!","Its a worst restaurant which I have never ate. Foods are suck. Sushi pizza are cold. Tako balls are nasty. Those foods don't deserve for 24. 99 . its taste lile shit. . Server is impolite. He had been nice to all white tables and look at us as a dirty look. Seem like he didn't like Asian . . We had been there since 8:30 pm . 9:20 the server said last call in 9:30. We ordered some food at 9:25 and the food hadn't come out.  . Bill came out with 120$ for 4 ppl. We were really upset about a services. We gave 125$ . the server actually look in to my face and ask me for a tips. . I've never have somebody asking me for a tips. The server suck has a thick face to ask customer for tips. . I will never come back to this restaurant again.","stopped in for a snack, well worth it. . Friendly service, takes a bit of time to get your order, at time of our visit only 1 person behind the counter. . This our first visit here, Mamajoun was listed in Scarborough Mirror as recommended places to eat. . Food : I would likely say most of the \"jouns\" are good for a snack for 1 person, 2 is likely more than plenty for 1 person to eat unless you're super hungry. My wife and I were only looking for a snack so we had 1 joun each (1 ham &amp; cheesy joun and 1 half zataar and have cheese). If you are really hungry I would say consider their Pizza offerings. Can't comment on the pizza's as of this writing since we haven't ordered a pizza here yet. Will update of course when we do. . Drinks : If you are a diabetic beware of the Jarritos drinks. Even tho the ones we got (mandarin and mango) tasted good, the sugar content is really high. . Note for foodie's with Gout : \"soujouk\" is a beef sausage made in house. If you are managing your Gout flare-ups I'd recommend avoiding the items with \"soujouk\". . Would definitely come back for tasting other Joun offerings along with trying out some of the pizza offerings.","We went in this past Thursday night after traveling all day. Its legit. The service was really good and so was the pizza. We went back before we left pitts for san diego. Glad the front desk suggested this place to us. Its not really a touristy spot so we definitely got some weird looks when we first walked in haha. But it was worth it. Its a really good spot for some pizza with the fam or friends. My son is a super picky eater (yes he has even passed on pizza before) but he loved the pizza here.","I used to be a big fan of \"the other pizza chain that specializes in pan pizza\". When we found out that Dominos makes pan pizza we had to try and now we are hooked. It's less greasy and the cheese is much better. Dominos is now our favourite pizza chain!. And this location is our favourite place to go! The staff here are energetic, friendly and they really aim to please. I come here often now and they know me by name and we have a good conversation while I wait for my order. They know precisely how we like our pizza (not well done, but almost. . . ). . We live outside the delivery area and we rather drive and pick up our pizza than to get delivery from the other location closer to our house.","We stopped here for lunch with the baby on Saturday. We were seated immediately and the server got us our drinks and some warm bread and butter right away. Our server was very friendly (in fact just a little too sugary sweet) and she did her job well. . We ordered from the lunch menu. I got the Miso Salmon and my husband ordered the cheese pizza. Our food was out within 15 minutes and mine was delicious, but my husband said his pizza was just so-so and about the same quality as a cheese pizza from Sam's Club.  (OUCH!). Anyway, our bill for two passion fruit iced teas, a lunch pizza, a lunch salmon and a slice of the pina colada cheesecake (to go) was $42, before gratuity. The baby just ate off of my plate because she is too little for her own plate still. . I ate the pina colada cheesecake slice later that night and it was just okay. It may just be me, but I think that their more exotic cheesecake flavors aren't nearly as good as the plain old vanilla bean cheesecake. Maybe it's because the other ingredients in the more exotic cheesecake varieties detract from their perfect vanilla cheesecake recipe. . . ? I dunno what it is, but I've experienced this phenomenon more than once. Sadly this time I thought it'd be different with the promising pina colada flavor, but it just didn't deliver. It didn't taste very tropical, or very cheese-cakey. I'll just remind myself to order the plain vanilla cheesecake next time and stop being drawn in by the tempting siren song of the exotic cheesecake flavors.","Stopped at Humble Wine Bar for their happy hour. Experience was great and pizza was awesome. Found a seat by the pizza oven and got to see the mad skills of the cooks with their pizza magic. Very relaxed chill spot. Staff was friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back.","Ahhh, what a great place! I stopped by here in mid-May with my cousin and I would come in here all the time if I lived in Pittsburgh. The owners were incredibly nice and you could tell that this is good old-fashioned family owned business. The pizza was mouth-watering and I really loved my veal parm sub. I would highly recommend this place and I hope I can stop in again someday!","This place was a nice find on yelp appreciate the reviews on this place and concur it's very good food i had pizza awesome and the St. Louis ribs and the BBQ sauce was excellent and the broccoli tempura tasty would highly recommend a try being from out of town I'm always Game to try something new very happy I came","Can not justify a frozen crust gluten pizza the size of a plate for $16. 90 ridiculous! It scary to eat here. . To top it all off, pizza was burnt. Beyond chard. . I don't mind paying higher prices but quality has to meet price. . Ridiculous!","Pizza is pretty good here!  I've been stopping in here occasionally ever since it was open and the pizza here has always been consistently good. The baklava is a must-try and there is always a recurring special with the pizza and a 2-liter soda. A little more expensive than the Marco's Pizza I usually frequent, but since I work right down the street, stopping in for a pizza on my lunch is always a good idea. Plus, it's always nice to stop in and snag a pizza after drinkin' at Apache Joes right across the parking lot before going home to relax.","Waited an hour for the food to come. When it arrived it looked like it was sitting in the drivers trunk for two days. Medium pizza and couldn't stomach a single slice. My girlfriend and I are now out $30 and still hungry. Check your pizza before you pay. . really.","*Nom nom nom*. That's the sound of me munching on my yummy pizza from Nello's - fast service, friendly folk and great pizza? My kind of place!!!","Their tag line, \" better ingredients, better pizza, Papa John's\", should be changed to \" better pizza, horrible service where the manager hangs up on you, Papa John's\"! I was sent an email with a special discount. I followed the link and ordered a pizza for delivery. Like I've done a dozen times before. I'm sure they drivers remember me, I tip well. The promised time of 19-29 minutes seemed great. Ordered at 7:23pm. At 8:20 pm I called to ask about my food. I was placed on hold immediately. 4-5 minutes. The girl finally picked up and I asked about my dinner, gave my name and address. . she seemed confused. She said the address they had for my order was next door to them and they cancelled it. I asked \"why didn't you call me? you have my number. \" She couldn't answer, but said she would get a manager. The manager, no name offered, came to the phone after a solid 4 minutes. (This call is now 10 minutes long). In a nut shell he said they thought it was a prank call and cancelled it. I gave him my address, name and even offered my customer number from the web order. He didn't care. He was equally silent when I asked why didn't he call me to confirm the address? He responded with blaming me for the mix up and HANGING UP ON ME! No apologies, no offer to correct the error. He just hung up. This is not the first time I've had issues with this store. It will be the last. There are 3 other pizza places in the immediate area, they now get my business and money. Good bye Papa.","M&amp;B does pizza and they do it right. Probably the best thin crust pizza in Toronto. Step inside if you can find it. There are 2 entrances, one on Ontario St. that has some sort of M&amp;B signage, another on king inside the office building. I recommend coming in through Ontario St. and come up the stairs where you will be welcomed with the delicious aroma of pizza and a surprising decor. . Don't be fooled by the blue glass and white concrete exterior of the building, there interior is rustic but chic. Exposed duct work, wood ceilings, white brick walls, worn wood banquettes, black leather cover chairs, and what I like to call \"THE TABLE\". . \"THE TABLE\" is probably the coolest table in the entire place. Great for holding a large party and possibly used for communal dining. This table has inlay tiles, fancy brown suede seats, and seats up to 15 people. . Service was great as far as large tables go. I came in a very large group of about 12 and the server greeted all of us and was very accommodating. She brought out some free bread and olive oil since it took so long to fire all our pizzas. She had great pizza recommendations and was more than happy to split the bill up so everyone could pay separately. . The pizza is tremendous. Since coming back from New York a few months ago I've been craving some good pizza and all the pizzas I've had in between just wasn't up to snuff. Mangia e Bevi was a refreshing burst of life in my pizza-world. It's not a New York style pie, it's a thin crust pizza and a good one at that. I got the Prosciutto Funghi pizza. The crust is thin, crisp, and slightly charred, sauce is fresh and not too seasoned, and the cheese is fresh and they don't put too much. The one gripe I have about the pizza is that the crust needs a bit more of a chewiness as I found it to be slightly dense. That being said still the best pizza in our fine city. . Overall, probably my favorite thin crust pizza in the city. At an average price of $12 it is definitely worth a try. Don't be discouraged by the awkward building and location like I was the first time I passed by as I'm still kicking myself for not trying it sooner.","Service was great but , The wait was very long and when we finally got our pizza it was just another mediocre pizza. I would understand if the place was busy but at that time there were two other couples there and already eating! I was very disappointed.","Pizza is really yummy!. The pizza are really big. It was myself and my boyfriend and we each took a slice home. You can also do half and half different pizza (which is what we did) he got the really spicy pizza, and I got plain cheese. . Overall good service, and great pizza, recommend.","I don't review fast food places. . but this is one of those establishments that I need to review because of their outstanding product and i am not alone in this opinion. i first discovered this franchise in Alaska, and then everywhere else. It is plainly good pizza - but the secret is quality AND quantity. Their stuffed pizzas run 4+ lbs (terrible measuring system invented by imperialistic invaders and lingers in our society like a bad fart), and if you make that a family size then you'll come home with a 5+ lbs pizza pie that will feed you amazingly aggressively and violate your diet restrictions so hard and send you on the express train to obesity. . . . . but its good, oh-so good. And you can buy it early, store in fridge and unleash flavorgeddon in your own oven when you feel the need. That is why I use this franchise. . And this particular store is great because of the mood. The shift manager (I assume) is the happiest guy you meet, and he is quick, witty and happy. That's another plus. try this pizza. They deserve it, and go big - go stuffed, but don't under-cook it.","Went for lunch and ordered from the lunch special two course option- either a cauliflower soup or peach summer salad and a personal sized pizza for $18. The salad was surprisingly pretty with butter lettuce, ham and a white cheese that reminded me of a creamy mozzerella or Burrata with sliced peach and lightly dressed. The margarita pizza was amazing- wood fired crust was cooked perfectly, and the cheese, basil and marinara were all on point. All the pies I saw looked great! Good place to go watch sports also.","Really like the concept but they sure skimp on the toppings if you get anything other then red sauce and mozzarella. I'll add a pic of my pizza that had large bubbles in it do to the lack of toppings.","I ordered combo 3 which was slice of pizza, 5 wings, and a fountain drink. First of that the cook had no ETA on the wings being done. Since they where on 97 and I was number 1 so I decided to wait and see how long it would be. It didn't take that long. The pizza could of been better but still good. The wings are pretty good. The staff was really friendly. Would recommend this place.","We ordered the pizza, wings and pepperoni rolls for delivery. Food was really good. Probably the best pizza in Coraopolis.","Came to Montreal for a weekend trip and decide last minute on Bevo. It was a Saturday night and we called around 8pm and they were friendly and accommodating in getting us a reservation despite being busy. The decor is old world meets new world with minimalist sitting pods by the bar and exposed brick throughout the restaurant. The upstairs seating area is gorgeous, but we didn't make it up there. Ordered the prosciutto, arugula, and Parmesan pizza and was not disappointed! The waitstaff was attentive and friendly. The music was loud and I noticed a very high female to male ratio, but there might have been an event going on. This place is not overrated - I'm a New Jersey native whose lived in New York and this is seriously good pizza. Bravo Bevo.","Been eating their pizza for almost 60 years and it's still among the very best I've had ANYWHERE in the country, including NY, SFO, Boston, LA, wherever! I think the city should proclaim this place a Cleveland Historical Landmark because when it comes to pizza, this place has earned it. Their other products are all very good, from cookies to bread, to donuts (yum) to, well, everything. LONG LIVE MAZZONE'S!!!","Food **** - Service ***** - ambience ****. We ordered the vegetarian Pizza and a veggie pasta in white wine lemon sauce. I must the say the pizza was really delicious. The pizza bread was quite tasty &amp; the tomato sauce used in the pizza was really delicious. . The pasta however, was only a 2. 5/5. The penne was dry and did not taste as awesome as the pizza did. . The service was good. Very inviting and responsive waiter. I felt good giving him a good tip. . Certainly recommend this place.","The service is pretty good, you will always hear \"Hi Welcome to Cici's\" everytime you go. In fact you might hear it so much it starts to annoy you, or, like me you think it's funny and laugh. The pizza is pretty cheap, both in cost and quality. It's not the best pizza ever, but is overall still pretty good. You can get a pizza made practically any way you want it.  . The cinnamon rolls are the absolute best!!  I go pretty much for those gooey, cinnamon rolls alone. I usually get 3-4 slices of pizza, and than 1-2 plates of cinnamon rolls. . that's how good they are.  . All you can eat for under 6 bucks is a great deal. Im only giving this place a 4 because the pizza isn't top of the line pizza, but worth what you pay for.","Best brunch in the city! Was greeted with a warm welcome and a steaming cup of joe, my friend got a latte. It was great to see they offered other beverages too such as mimosas, tea, and various coffee beverages. I ordered the Tortilla Espanola, it was so decadent and tasty. My friend ordered the breakfast pizza which was a very generous portion. Our server assisted us with questions about the menu, and was on top of everything. You can't go wrong here","We had my sons 7th birthday party here in November and it was such a great experience!! The staff called me about a week in advance to confirm the party and answer any questions I had, and they also asked me if his party had a theme! When we arrived for the party, they had provided themed balloons for his party for us which I thought was super sweet and went above and beyond just providing us with black and red decorations! Our party host was wonderful!! My son and all of his friends had so much fun! And for the price, it was WELL worth it to not have to worry about decorating, set up, or clean up at all!!! Also love that the hosts take care of plating and distributing pizza and cake so the parents can be involved with the party and take pictures! We had a great time!! Thank you!!","Wanna hear a riddle? Ever notice how every one who eats at guys is drunk? . You give? Because had they been sober they would notice the blend taste of cardboard overwhelming their delectable palates. It s passable at best. But recently they've outdone themselves. I somehow managed to get ill eating that stuff. I ve never gotten food poisoning from pizza before. This was a first.","Really great pizza and wonderful service! We were in Vegas from Sacramento. One of our party had eaten there before and claimed it was her \"favorite\" pizza so I was edited to try it! It was really great!! It will be on the list for every Vegas trip from now on!","Have I had better pizza in my lifetime? Of course. Have I had a better $16 extra large with extra cheese delivered to my home in Pittsburgh, our fair city? Not even close. It's good delivery pizza at a reasonable price, which is exactly what you expect from a place like this. Their Greek salad is good, and their veggie hoagie is filling and tasty. This is my go to delivery place, and I've never been disappointed with our order. We usually order on a Friday or Saturday night for dinner a couple of nights a month, and it's always delivered, hot, within 45 minutes. If you want good, greasy pizza, this fits the bill.","I love these stores. I have been to many. GREAT options for pizza. Take it home, bake it yourself. Hot and fresh out of the oven. . This was a newer location. Much easier than my other location in Apache Junction. . And they have some new menu options. . Try it. You won't order delivery again.","Eh.  It was okay. I suppose. Our waitress was overly helpful and kinda in your face nosey, which I really, really don't like. My food was good enough. I got the grilled chicken breast sandwich with onion rings (really thick but pretty tasty)My sister got the white pizza and was very pleased with it and said she'd get it again. . Our overall impression on our first trip To Frankie and Louie's on a Sunday after church, was the food was okay, the service left much to be desired and I thought the pricing was a little high for the offerings. I might try it again if going with a group, but doubt I'd dine in again alone.","My husband and I went to Giordanos because we had 2 separate people tell us how much they loved the pizza. We now have a new favorite pizza place in the Valley. It was amazing!  The service was great and the food was wonderful. I would go there again in a heartbeat.","Sans aucun doute ma meilleure pizza \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al ! Rapport QUALIT\u00c9/prix parfait et c'est Rare \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. . . Bien contant d'avoir pu d\u00e9guster une \u00e9ni\u00e8me fois ce soir une bonne pizza chez vous, avant mon d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement sur la c\u00f4te ouest. Bon courage \u00e0 vous en esp\u00e9rant vous revoir lors de mes d\u00e9placements \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.","Went here for the first time and it's decent. . Unfortunately we started with the Focaccia Bread. . . It was bland at best. When I asked if we could get a side of marinara our server told us it would be $1. 25 extra. . . I told her to go ahead and charge us. Otherwise there was no way I'd have eaten it. My advice would be to try something else as an appetizer unless they start serving it with the marinara or seasoned olive oil. . . something with more flavor. . We ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza and it was pretty good. The pizza crust is thin and crispy. The BBQ sauce had good flavor. There could have been a little more chicken on the pizza. . For dessert I tried the Tiramisu. It was very good. One of the better I've had in a while. . Overall, they're a solid 3 to 3. 5 stars, but our server Miranda pushes it up to 4 stars. She was friendly and attentive all evening. There were 8 of us and no one ever had to wait long for anything. A big thanks to her.","was in AZ for the holiday week and after going out in Scottsdale, went to Tempe in search of this 24 hour pizza place. I'm from Chicago, where pizza was born, and never heard of 24 hour joint like that.  well its good, its affordable, its a clean place, and very importantly they know what they're doing, cause if not, where I'm from, they'll take you out back and beat you up silly.  the pizza i asked them to make, cause its not on the menu, is how i always order it back home, thin crust w/ ground beef, green peppers, mushrooms, and yellow hot peppers!  that's my pizza, you can order it  too. So they made it perfect!!!! salute to Gus's, or should i say, AL, who's the owner!!!!!!","Love the thin crust pizza but it was a bit too thin and didn't hold the toppings well. That said, the actual crust was one of the handful of crusts that I ate at any pizza place. Good atmosphere except for the large coat rack in the back room and lack of authentic music. Very good service. Great bread with olive oil and balsamic served before meal. Would return to try the pasta.","Three and a half stars. . Pizza? What pizza? It doesn't look, smell or taste like pizza!!!. . . . but it's very good. I'd describe it as a Mediterranean puffy pie with your choice of ingredients. The standard offerings are of the kitchen sink variety but that's not my style. I ordered an individual with cheese, mushroom, onion and sausage and it was yummy. When the waitress brought it to the table I was like \"what the hell is that?\"  I though it was a failed attempt at dip dish pizza, but as i ate into it I shed my preconceptions and enjoyed it for what it is. Very little tomato sauce BTW but that's a plus. I spoke a little with the owner when I paid, she's a real nice person, she even said \"tell me what dish you want and I'll make it for you\".","Only had 1 person inside waiting on ppl and at the bar. Was there for 20 mins and no one came to take my order, when all I wanted was a slice of pizza to go (that was already made). . Terrible service.","Pretty nice property. Lacks in the value department when you are close to $300 per night, but that's probably our fault for staying here during Arizona high season - Spring training. Even so, the rooms are pretty small and some of the finishes come off as cheap looking.  . Beautiful pools and grounds in general. One of the pools has a small \"beach\" which was nice to play on with our then 5 month old. They also have several firepit areas and as I understand it, offer S'mores in the evenings. The bar is very nice as well. . A really nice touch is that they have a car onsite that they use as a shuttle. So if you need to head to Old Town Scottsdale, they will drop you off and come pick you up later. Or, in my case, if you want to pick up pizza, they'll drive you down and wait for you while you take care of business.  . They had free wine every night from 4-6 PM in the lobby bar area. WiFi was free as long as you are a Kimpton member (they signed me up at the front desk and viola!  I had free WiFi!  . Overall, I am a fan of Firesky. We would totally stay here again, although probably not during Spring Training.","This place is based on a recommendation from a fellow food enthusiast who says this place is quite memorable, so we came by to sit in the patio since it was great weather. . Bonus marks for: Lots of young woman and its open late for night time snack!!!. We were greeted with a young, friendly server who brought our bread, I assume its some sort of baguette with some balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil. I was hungry, so I consumed most of the bread. . . =). We started things off with their grilled calamari. . . The calamari tasted rubbery to me, and dry tasting. It was served on arugula tomato mixed with balsamic sauce. I would say that I've definitely had better calamari elsewhere, and would probably not order this dish again here. . . . 2nd thing was the pizza. . . I forgot the name of the pizza, but the toppings had goat cheese, roasted red peppers and other veggies on it. . . The plus side for this pizza is the crust tasted alright, but kind of bland to me without sauce. I definitely envisioned that goat cheese would make pizza taste creamier but not for this one. I vouch for great tasting pizza at 'Pizzeria Libretto'!. Total bill was $28 after tax! Would anyone say that's standard or overpriced?. Would I come back? Yea, just to try some other stuff. . . The place has a nice atmosphere, all the young crowd goes there. . . Just some improvement on the food and its good to go!","Terrible pizza extremely disappointing especially from a James Beard Chef. The Forager was so greasy and under seasoned. Wonderful ingredients however poor execution, not impressed at all. Will stick to Settebello at least the pizza is seasoned and good!! The bread sticks are a palate killer and ruin your taste buds loaded with grease and spice. Little over priced in my opinion after 2 glasses of wine, beet salad, cheese and charcuterie $100 plus tip, the food and the service were both bland. Step it up we expect more out of a James Beard Chef, especially because Sage is incredible.","Exceptional local Carefree/Cave Creek/N. Scottsdale hangout for quality Italian, tasty gourmet pizzas, and even back-East style fast food. Prices are very reasonable and consistency is never an issue with food or service.","This was my first Montreal sushi experience-- being from Vancouver, I'm a harsh judge when it comes to sushi. . This place wasn't bad, it was like a cute little restaurant inside a convenience store. The choices were very very limited and were, in my honest opinion, all kind of the same thing. . I had no idea that dynamite rolls were just a west coast thing; I asked and the waitress had no idea what I was talking about-- but they were more than willing to roll up a custom order which was nice. . I also got to try my first ever sushi pizza. I had no idea that was a thing (Montreal/east coast thing?) but my goodness, it was yummy. . It was pretty pricey for the quality and lack of quantity; I think with my friend we spent about $65. But I can understand why seafood would be more expensive here. . Finally, just a general thought about the Japanese places that I've researched about here. I'm very surprised that they only either offer just rolls/cones or just hot foods. . But not both. Maybe they offer both at the very expensive $300+ places?. Maybe I'll have better luck in Verdun.","Delizioso!. I've had many of their pizzas there. . . I live near the place. . . for now. It's pizza that can still be competitive! If I ever have to move somewhere else. . . I'll eat OCP!","Came here a second time and I still love this place! I ordered the Bannock Bannock again which is still delicious but I feel like this time they made it fatter. Also, the first time they didn't fold it so I had to guess how to eat the thing and I guess right because the second time I went, they folded it in half. . Also had the mac and cheese which I really enjoyed. Would I order it again? Probably not but it's something worth trying. . I tried their parsnip soup which was good. The main reason why I ordered it was because of the pumpkin seeds in the soup. I was disappointed with the pumpkin seed because I thought they were going to make the seed crispy but it was too soft for my liking. The soup itself was delicious. . The sweet potato fries here are good but they added too much salt. I enjoy my sweet potato fries with a bit of salt and pepper because I think it enhances the sweet taste but they went a bit overboard with the salt. . The roast duck poutine pizza was a disaster in my opinion. I never really enjoy poutine pizza but with that aside, the duck was way to dry. The fries reminded me of KFC fries (nothing wrong with that for those who like KFC fries but I don't like KFC fries). I guess I'm not the kind of girl that enjoys just putting anything on her pizza. . For dessert, I tried the smore's and it's not that great. The graham cracker was a bit soggy and there wasn't enough of it. It reminded me of a lava cake. Go for the tart if you're craving dessert. . Another highlight of the meal was the Mighty Canuck. I absolutely love that drink! The glass is sugar rimmed and there's a sugared orange chocolate candy on top of the drink. I also tried the Back Forty (I think that's what it's called) and there's too much cucumber taste in that. . Service was still great, they refilled our water whenever it was half full and took away empty plates. Also, they didn't charge me for the Back Forty and kindly replaced it with the Mighty Canuck.","If you aspire to have high blood pressure,  then this is the place has your name all over it!  Ordered a Kung Pao chicken,  had more sauce than the gravy in your Thanksgiving dinner. I slammed water for every bite I took. In addition to that, I blame my bubble guts on the under-cooked egg roll.  the agonizing search for the nearest restroom. The service was efficient and fast, but you may be better off at a Panda Express for the $12. I smell pizza next door!! (_)","MINDER BINDERS IS BACK !  HOORAH !  Mama Beth Bell !  So glad your family owns it now and for saving it. Thanks for polishing up Zeus and keeping all the boats intact. . Still loaded with wonderful memories and all the movie prop paraphernalia. . The Cobb Salad was great,  my daughter had the Patty Melt. . (wonderful) . . . The burgers looked awesome and the pizza looked  super tasty too. . .  . This place closed for 8 years. . .

Looking forward to enjoying this for years to come. GOOD ON YA !","Ugh. I used to love Papa Johns but this location does not do it justice.  . We have ordered the buffalo chicken pizza in the past when it was first introduced here. The base is ranch sauce with sliced chicken strips, bacon, onion, cheese and topped with a swirl of buffalo sauce. Our Buffalo chicken pizza arrived with no buffalo drizzle on top. Wouldn't they know this is probably the main ingredient which makes it a 'Buffalo' chicken pizza? . I called to let them know and the manager apologized. Decided to give them a second chance. I told them what happened last time. Again, received the pizza with no buffalo drizzle on top. Seriously?? Even after a phone call to order instead of my normal online ordering they still managed to make this incorrectly.  . Big Fail.","For a small neighborhood bar /restuarant,  this is as good as it gets. The food is good and the service is friendly. Patrons are friendly as well. I usually get one of their pizzas to eat,  but have eaten numerous other things from the menu and was never disappointed. The fish tacos have become a favorite of my girlfriend since she tried them a few weeks ago. One drawback is that they close kind of early. (10pm)  Not a problem for me,  but it might be for others.","For being a chain restaurant, I really do love this place. It's always consistent and taste delicious every time. Some of our favorites are the Alfredo of the Dark pasta with chicken, the Big Rig with Sausage, the BBQ chicken pizza is outstanding. And to top it off a pizza cookie for dessert. What more can I say. Great food, great prices, great service.","This place is actually more of a 3. 5 stars. The pizza isn't spectacular, but it is pretty good. I'm not a fan of the crust, it's too bready, but the toppings are high quality. The appetizers are very good also. The ravioli, cheese curds, and Texas-toast-style garlic bread are all excellent. The toasted ravioli (with cheese filling - never tried the beef) is particularly delicious and we order it every time. Even out-of-staters who had never heard of the concept found it tasty. I guess there is a rule that applying breading to a food item just makes it more awesome. . The breadsticks lack flavor. Things would be better if they just baked a plain pizza crust and sprinkled some cheese on it. Another flop was the fried chicken - pizza places never have good fried chicken. It was greasy and over-fried. Even KFC is better. . At least they have great subs and pasta. Other pizza places offer these things but usually they are sub-par. Not the case with Glass Nickel. They also have online ordering (a huge plus in my book), fast delivery and I've never had a problem with any of the delivery people. . I just don't get the hype over the Fetalicious. Every pizza place has a feta pizza these days. The Sacre Bleu is obviously the superior pie. Anyway, you can't really go wrong with Glass Nickel, but there are better alternatives *cough* Falbo's *cough* for the west-side pizza consumer.","Pizza review only!!!. 1) Their beer tastes good. 2) Their entres look like stuff you'd find anywhere else and at least smelled and looked good. 3) The place looks nice. BUT. . . the pizza claiming to be \"Authentic Chicago Deep Dish\". . . sucks. . . think Personal Pan Pizza from Pizza Hut. . . remember the doughy texture, the flavor, the look, etc. . . then you've eaten Old Chicago's deep sigh. . . just a waste. . . AND the personal pan (which the waitress said she 'split' with her friends cuz it was sooooooo much ran me almost $13 and barely filled me up. . However, I would go back to try their other offerings. . . if I have time.","Moving from Columbus to Vegas, we had to have people over for THE Buckeye game. New to the area, I wanted to try a local pizzeria instead of the usual Papa Johns. Knowing we were going with the 28\" colossal pizza, I preordered it. The gentleman on the phone (I think was an owner) was professional, personable, and guaranteed our pizza would be ready at the time I needed it by. . We were not disappointed. The pizza was so big, I had to fit it in my trunk. Our group of self-proclaimed foodies, ate damn near the whole pie! Having soooooo many options to eat in Vegas, its hard to become a regular at a place. I don't foresee that becoming an issue with Manhattans. The pizza sauce is a sweet, the cheese on top was the right amount, the pepperoni spicy. . Great local business, give it a try. I think it might be pizza night, tomorrow :)","I never write reviews, but this place was worth it. It wasn't perfect, but has a very \"what you see is what you get\" vibe, and what you see is pretty good. I recommend one of the pizzas straight out of the wood oven.","We went to Caramba's Fresh Mexican Food this weekend after hearing about it from some friends. We have been looking for authentic Mexican food here in Phoenix and not having to drive to Tucson to find it. Don't take this wrong, there are some really good Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, but Tucson has great Mexican food! . Caramba's is more of a dive-ish / dinner style restaurant that offers quick and friendly service and really good (almost to greatness) food. They were voted \"Best of Phoenix\" and Best Mexican Restaurant\" by Hispanic Newspapers. They are extremely low cost and offer HUGE serving sizes. What I like the most about Caramba's is they do not use lard nor MSG!  You can tell their food is extremely fresh and they offer several LOW CARB options for the healthy conscious. . My Chipotle loving friend left this place vowing never to eat at Chipotle again after eating their Machaca Beef Burito. Their Machaca Beef Buro is HUMUNGUS and very tasty!  Their chicken and shrimp Quesadilla's were also delicious and HUGE. They were served on a pizza pan for goodness sake!  Their carne asada and and pollo asado are also very good. They give you a bowl of warm, homemade chips and have a salsa bar. The two things that are keeping my experince from being 5 stars:. 1)  Yes they have a salsa bar and their salsa is very good but they give you these little salad dressing size cups to put it in. They are so small you can't fit a chip in them. . . . 2)  They charge you for soft drink and ice tea refills. I appreciate the fact they serve a good variety of domestic and foreign beer but sometimes you just want ice tea, especially during lunch. No one charges for tea refills!. Despite these two very small quirks,  I recommend you try the Caramba's Fresh Mexican Food on Bell and I17. They are better than or as good as any Mexican food available in Phoenix. I'm looking forward to my next visit!  I'm planning to try their Chile Relleno and Tamales!","Faema is an Italian cafe that one wouldn't expect in this area. The setup is huge and airy and the all the hustle and bustle makes one think that we are in Italy. . Plenty of options for food (paninis, pizza etc. ) in addition to the coffee related items. . I wanted my my caffeine fix so I went for a Cappuccino and a Biscotti. . The server was very friendly and chatted with me a bit before taking my order. . I was expecting a good version of espresso drinks here as they sell a lot of espresso machines (both commercial and residential) via the store next door. . The Cappuccino arrived quickly and looked nice. Nice froth on top (a more traditional take than the modern version that is getting popular nowadays). However it just went downhill here the espresso part was took weak for my liking and didn't offer much in term of taste. . The biscotti as well didn't offer much and was your run of a mill stuff. . I would say 2 stars for cappuccino. The paninis looked good so I will try them out next time I am in the area. . They have drink special for 4. 99$ so might be worth checking it out.","We ordered delivery from Fast Lane last night and it was delicious!  We got the Canadian and the Butter Chicken pizzas. . The Canadian was insane! Tons of meat, really good flavour and delicious crust. Not greasy at all. The butter chicken was really tasty too, really good flavour. Next time I would get it with green peppers. The delivery was quick and the price was really reasonable. This is our new favourite pizza place! I can't wait to try what else they have!","Sat outdoors and had great iced tea and fantastic pizza. Wait staff was really nice and atmosphere was just right.","Delivery review time!!. Great super wonderful!!. Thank you for being a great delivery person!! It's a playoff night but you made it here in great time!!. Idk your name BUT you delivered a great pizza and we are happy!!","Went there tonight 7pm not that busy, hostesses brought me to my seat, sat there for 10 minutes waitress focused on table next to me visited them 3 times. I got up a left. When to Boston pizza. Never again.","Surprise! Another outstanding experience at Oregano's! What makes this one special is the fact it was my younger son's birthday. And just like big brother, he wanted Oregano's. This time, we were in Glendale. . Unlike our recent visit to the Mesa location, we had to wait about 45 mins. What set this apart, was the fact the hosts brought out a fresh, hot pizza cut into tiny sample sized pieces for all those waiting. I've never seen this level of service before. At any restaurant!. My youngest leaned over and asked me \"Is it really worth the wait?\" I told him he would see soon. And once we were seated, our orders were taken promptly. And then the pizza arrived. He chose the same pizza his brother wanted for his birthday. . . How like them. . Our Clark Street Meat Pizza was amazing. As always! And our server was super cool. I am embarrassed that I can't recall his name, but he definitely delivered the experience we have come to expect from Oregano's. . And just like the previous visit, the meal was concluded with an awesome Pizzookie! Thanks to Glendale for a great meal and overall experience!","I've been to the Bread Company at least 6 times over the past three years all separated by months. The only reason I continue to go back has got to be because I forget about how sub-standard their food is. And today I decided to finally put my disappointment on the internet. . This review was spurred by a visit today to get coffee and a pastry. I ordered an americano that was obviously made with poor quality espresso, and perhaps by someone with little knowledge of what an americano should be. It was too watery, but maybe that is my taste. I also had what they dared to call a chocolate croissant. It could have been made days ago. Instead of being light and fluffy, it was dense and doughy and filled with chocolate chips that were never fully melted so they maintained their chip structure. I was less than impressed. But this seems to be the way things go at the Bread Company. . As I mentioned earlier, I have been going to the Bread Company for quite a few years (having been at the U of I as a student since 2008), and their menu has yet to change. At all. This sort of stagnancy is worrisome and really speaks to the lack of effort that the chef and/or owner put into this business. . On a recent dinner visit I got the chocolate fondue which came with possibly pre-made cinnamon bread slices, strawberries, and a plethora of apples and pears. I suppose the apples and pears were in season (it was November when I went), but I don't see how apples work with chocolate. . I've had their pizza many times, and I cannot deny that they do a good crust. . . but I just don't get the pizza that comes with a mountain of salad on top. It is just too much and overwhelms the pizza that really should be the star of the dish. . Overall the Bread Company is uninspired and very tired. This is reflected in their dusty, unchanging interior, their menus, and the often impolite, lackluster performances of the staff.","My boyfriend and I came to Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza after a terrible experience at Cadillac ranch-which resulted in only one of us getting a drink(mine was \"forgotten\" about as they changed the tap) and no food. So we were rather hungry at this point and made our way to Anthony's about 30 minutes before they closed. To start, their drinks are insanely expensive for a quick bite after a movie-which was all this was supposed to be. However, my frustration from Cadillac got the best of me and I settled on a glass of wine-for $11. 00. My boyfriend got a Yuengling which was considerably more reasonably priced. After reviewing the menu, we decided we wanted to make a pizza with prosciutto, mushrooms, and olives. Unfortunately, after ordering our server-who was incredibly warm, helpful, and attentive -came back and told us they were out of the prosciutto so we settled for pepperoni. The pizza, of course, was \"well done\" around the edges, however, the center was considerably underdone. The flavors were great and the pizza would have been excellent had it not been for the undercooked center. Overall, we will probably not be back-we had a total of 3 drinks (1 glass of wine, 2 yuenglings) and the pizza and our bill was pushing $60. 00 which is more than we had originally expected to spend for a quick bite to eat after a movie. And, as I said before, the pizza, although the flavors were good was undercooked in the center-which did not ruin the pizza entirely but came close to it. I do not feel the need to revisit this establishment.","Got a large mushroom and pepperoni. Can't say enough about how good this pizza was. Perfect amount of sauce, cheese, and toppings. Everyone who ate it loved it. Wish there was one near my house. . .","I've tried their pizza, hoagies, and fries. They are alright. I wouldn't go back for pizza or hoagie. . But try their bbq wings! It's delicious. I love their bbq sauce.","We love the ice cream here always great!! We decided to try pizza and although flavor was great, pizza had no sauce was thin and really dry. . . I asked for extra sauce. I was half wondering if they thought I said no sauce. . not sure was good flavor though. Will keep coming back for ice cream!","We had the veggie and cheese pizza here he other night and it was very good. The large is what we ordered and we only were able to finished one box! We also ordered plain cheesecake yum! I would definitely eat here again!","Great spot to chow down on carbs in Summerlin. Service is fast and friendly, prices are best in town, and the pizza is delicious!","This is a true hidden gem. Must try! I live 5 mins from the place and didn't realize that I have one of the best middle eastern bakeries in Scarborough!. The owner is always working and makes you feel welcome. Try the red pepper pizza or the zaatar/cheese! Both are so good. . The only problem I noticed was the lack of staff. He needs to hire more people to keep up with the demand but that is a good problem to have as an owner!","Not much to rate, they had some good pizza. I had a spinach and mushroom pizza. Still haven't found a pizza joint in Charlotte that does beef pepperoni yet. But this place is good I rode by it all the time and finally stopped in to give them a try. Thumbs up. . This is an update review about the Chick-O-Philly. This sandwich is the damn bomb. I always get this when I get a sandwich here cause it's one of the best sandwiches in Charlotte. Now I didn't say, The Best but it's one of them. I got the 12 inch today with fries and it was good. I get it with Everything on it. They never disappoint me any time I come here to eat.","Their pizza and wings are amazing! Their grandma style pies are also delicious! I've only ordered pick up and it's always ready when they say it will be. It's in my top 3 pizza places in Pittsburgh.","Great pizza for the price. Friendly and reliable delivery as well as call ahead ordering for kids parties. Great wings as well. . When picking up instead of delivery they give my kids cookies or other treats. Very family friendly people.","I just discovered this place. I have only eaten here once so far, but I loved everything about it. I will be back soon, and often. Great location just a block off the Capitol square, and a very inviting atmosphere. Weather permitting, one whole wall is mostly open to the street, allowing the sunshine or breeze to get in, which is really nice when the weather is right. The menu offers a lot of traditional Italian fare, as well as more adventurous options. I had the steel pan pizza, and it was fantastic. Fresh ingredients and excellent preparation made for a meal that should have left me with plenty of leftovers from the generous portions, but I ate the whole thing because I just couldn't resist. The service was responsive and friendly, and the prices were very reasonable, especially considering the portions and the quality. Highly recommended.","Me and my husband have had lots of pizza from many different places, this is still in our top 3 favorite! One of which being Chicago's own, Giordano's. Rasicci's pizza is amazing, I live 45 minutes away and try to get it as often as I can. Their wedges are some of my favorite too, I've heard great things about their chicken but have not tried it yet because I love their pizza too much!  Crust is wonderfully flaky, layers of ooey gooey cheese, topped with some of the best red sauce! If you're near by, or like me and are willing to drive a ways for some good food, this is your place!","The happy hour menu was the first thing that caught our eye at Crush, $10 pizzas and $5 wine! My friend and I sat on a lounge style couch, had the wonderful Malbec that was on special and ended up splitting the sausage pizza that was not on the happy hour menu. . The restaurant was fairly quite and easy to have a conversation in, music was not to loud and even though we were seated near the entrance it was easy to forget about the casino floor. Our waitress was attentive and our water glasses were never empty. We will definitely visit again before our stay is over.","Great new York style pizza!!! Quality ingredients, fast delivery. We will definitely be eating here again","My review is a bit overdue seeing as how we actually ordered from Naked Pizza a few weeks ago. . Had some friends over for game 7 of the NBA finals and had been wanting to try out this place. So we called in an order and brought it back. We ordered the Mediterranean, the Farmvil and a plain cheese pizza. We weren't given a crust option so thin is what we got, paper thin. . The ingredients were all really good quality. But the sauce didn't really stand out, and to me, that's the most crucial ingredient. . There's really nothing else in the immediate area to compete with Naked Pizza, business-wise, but I don't really think this place will be a huge success. I'll probably give it another go sometime down the line, but a couple nights ago I opted to drive a little bit out of the way for a better pie, and better value. It's a bit overpriced for what you're getting.","Ordered the calamari and a buffalo chicken pizza with no onions and paid an extra fee for a side of ranch. The calamari was so over cooked that I couldn't chew through it and the pizza had a lot of onions. . . and they forgot our ranch. Not worth the $44. And don't say you have coke products if you carry pepsi . . .","Found this place through Google offers and so happy we did. Maybe the best tasting pizza in Phoenix. They have buy 1 get 1 free on Tuesdays so you get 2 amazing pizzas for about $13. Don't miss this place.","I do not recommend ever ordering delivery from this location. I decided to give them another chance because the first time I ordered it was football Sunday, took over 2 hours to receive my pizza and it was delivered cold. This time, I was estimated a 28-38 min delivery time. I placed my order at 6:07. It was taken out of the oven at 6:25. I didn't receive my order until 7:25. I called the location right before it arrived and they assured me it would be warm because they keep it under a heating lamp. I have worked in a pizza place. A pizza does not hold up for half a hour under a heating lamp and half a hour in a bag out for delivery. The manager, Sandra, is equally as rude and refused to do anything about the experience. I have complained to corporate and they can't do anything because this is a privately owned business. If you want pizza, you are better off going across the street and getting one from Little Caesars.","Ordered for carry out and we were overcharged. We were told we needed a coupon. Don't trust their invoices. Go elsewhere. The pizza will be better too.","I usually come to Afandi a lot and would have never noticed the Sholay restaurant sign if it wasn't for my boyfriend. I had heard about it through yelp but didn't expect to try it out anytime soon. . I was taken back by the fact that the owner of the place was not Indian! He was VERY friendly though and so I give this place a 5 for customer service! After having asked if the meat was halal, the owner told us that everything was halal except for the beef pepperoni. I'm very grateful that he not only verbally stated it, but has it written down on the menu as well. . We weren't really starving so we placed an order for halal wings &amp; fries as well as the pizza naan (with chicken, cheese and pizza sauce). He asked us if we wanted him to make it spicy, and like most Indians and Pakistanis, OF COURSE we said yes. So he made added chillies as well. . Fast forward to the food - the halal wings were GREAT. Spicy, but a little too breaded. My bf noticed this as well, and was the first one to point it out. The fries came out extremely salty, but I finished the majority of them anyways. The pizza naan was good! Especially if you like chicken keema! The chillies the owner added made it spicy and quite scrumptious. . The best part of our trip to this place was definitely the MANGO LASSI. The owner gave us each a sample which led us to ordering one. The lassi was thick, unlike many other places you order a lassi, and you could taste the yogurt. YUM. . The owner also gave us a sample of the rice pudding, but I wasn't that big of a fan. I'm not the biggest sugar addict but I just wasn't feeling it. . I hope to come back for the lamb burger and the lassi next time! . Overall, this isn't entirely \"Sholay\". If you are looking for Indian (as in\"desi khana\") food, go elsewhere. If you are looking for American styled Indian food, this is your place.","I ate here for Winterlicious this week. All three courses were incredible and such a great value for $25!  . I had curried pumpkin soup to start, oyster mushroom/Gouda pizza and panna cotta for dessert. . Such a warm and cozy atmosphere too!! Highly recommend!","We have been here twice now. Excellent food and very accommodating to vegan requests. Great pizza and a delicious cauliflower side dish.","Excellent service and love the pizza! Salads were fresh and large enough to share. Great location before or after a movie! Family friendly atmosphere and clean.","This is for the pizza to go portion of the restaurant. . The pizzas are supposed to be a quick gourmet pizza, so don't expect to find your typical toppings aside from just pepperoni. There were maybe 4-5 options. The pizzas themselves were just meh. The crust was not that thin and crunchy. For a better late night pizza, secret pizza at the Cosmo is a much better option. Also, the line moves sooo slow.","We love the pizza here. I am from New York and it taste like it was made there. The server are all wonderful and very polite. The garlic bread is to die for.","I am a member of LVAC and they had a booth sampling the pizza. It was fantastic. I got a coupon and decided the next day to get it for dinner. Every pizza place charges several more dollars for a gluten free crust and Custom Built does not!  They have extremely reasonable prices. The best part is they have goat cheese!  Love this place.","I have eaten at Sauce on many occasions. I typically get the pizza or will go with a salad. I ordered a grilled sandwich the last time, and it took over 20 minutes to get to my table. The person I was eating with was already done when it got to my table. The food is good, but I just stay away from the sandwiches now and stick to the pizza. . It only gets 3 stars though, because the pizzas are kinda small for the price. I would rather go to grimaldis if I want a pizza.","So my first time was a bad experience when I took my mom. The manager did contact me and offered me another experience ON THEM. My mom was busy last night so I took my fianc\u00e9 instead. I have to say it was a great experience due to the awesome waitress Carla! she was so sweet and recommended her favorite things on the menu. This time I got the zuchinni fritti as an appetizer. The marinara sauce was delicious to dip the fried zuchinni in. For the entree I got the Ragatoni Bolognese,  I swear it tasted just like the one I make at home. Full of flavor and I even added shrimp to it. Huge shrimp! My fianc\u00e9 got him a pizza he enjoyed it and really loved the crust. For dessert I got their homemade tiramisu which was delicious! so I had plenty of leftovers lol! I think I just happen to come on a bad day with a terrible waitress my first experience. I will definitely recommend this place after my 2nd experience.","Tout est dans l'assiette!effectivement la patronne ne vous \u00e9coute pas, les tuiles blanches font penser \u00e0 une salle de bains, seulement 17 places \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur(toutes les visites ne peuvent \u00eatre qu' impromptues, par petits groupes) et 60? En terrasse quand le temps fait penser \u00e0 Naples. et un service lent(overstaffing en salle?)vins italiens-on les f\u00e9licite!. MAis alors la pizza:exceptionnelle tant la pate que la garniture!alors avec la gentillesse du personnel c'est l'\u00e9motion. on y retourne aux heures creuses pour \u00e9viter de manquer de place. . Pour la petite histoire:il y a 35 ans(deja) ouvrait, en face le PATATOU avec la 1\u00e8re terrasse \u00e0 Outremont. on faisait la queue. . . . .","Just tried Stevie's for the first time today. Wings were just okay but the pizza is excellent. . Delicious sauce! Also much needed in this location.","The famous Fetalicious is here, and yes, I'm a fan. . Fetalicious, which features feta, tomatoes, onion, spinach, and a few other things is what I usually add to a group pizza order. Even people who are usually not fans of pizza beyond the regular standards usually like Fetalicious. In addition, Glass Nickel has a spicy tomato sauce that featured in the Border to Border pizza (pineapple, jalape\u00f1os are the main ingredients) that is a great addition. My favorite non-pizza item is the spinach cheese bread. . Overall, GNP is one of my top choices for delivery. Delivery and pickup is always quite timely and they have good hours. If you sign up for their mailing list, they have good opportunities to get limited time discounts or find days in which 10% of pizza sales go to a selected charity.","Looking for a place that deliver close by didn't have a car at the time and I found this place quick delivery and I must say the wings are the bomb pizza was great but i kept coming back for the wings . the wings were bomb well worth it at $17. 99  had leftovers for the next day. Well worth it for a single person.","Yum!! Akira Back has delicious, modern Japanese food that is so unique! My boyfriend and I had an awesome waiter who gave us suggestions throughout the menu. It's a fun concept because you're able to try a bunch of menu offerings and not be super full at the end of your meal. I haven't added pictures of all of the dishes we ate, but the tuna pizza pictured first was definitely our favourite. Aside from the great food and service, the atmosphere is really nice. The only downside was the $30 dollar cocktail that tasted like any old fashioned you could get anywhere for half the price. Other than that, we were really happy with this new spot!","Its pizza time done right, I've been using this location for the past 2 years and they have never disappointed me. When you have to provide a lot of food for a lot of people on a low budge papa John's is a home run. Really good quality pizzas cooked up fresh and ready to be devoured. Great for kids birthdays, office parties, family gatherings etc. I know a lot of folks have some complaints about the delivery service, my rating is based on carry out only. This is my favorite pizza chain, they always have good deals, fresh toppings and prompt service.","Very good! We had 3 pizzas: half spicy, half pesto, mozzarella, chicken, bacon, mush, olives and onion. Pepp/bacon &amp; Alfredo/tomato sauce/Pesto combined sauce with sausage, chicken, pepp and bacon. All was really fresh and crust was not thick or thin just in the middle. Owner was nice and even gave my son a free mango sorbet. Cost was a little steep at $32. 00 BUT its fresh and custom so that's ok by me!  We will def return! Wish we had one closer to our house in SW side of town. :-)","If I could give negative stars,  I WOULD!! This was the WORST pizza and wings I've ever had! The pizza dough was still raw and the wings burnt bones. . . So disappointing!","Had the 14 in Big Berlescori. It was very good. I love it. It is pepperoni , sausage and Italian salami. Not sure why other reviews said their wasn't much flavor. It was seriously some of the best pizza I've had. Maybe they made changes to their pizza but right now it is spot on. . I also really like the decor here. I'm from the country so the very rustic old barn wood they use to decorate looks really cool. Wish I could have a cabin or house like this. Very cool on the inside for being in a strip mall.","I come here all the time. . . in fact I have been here 3 times this week for lunch. I have had their pizza a few times which is always good, but I really love the sandwiches and soups and salads. I either get their 1/2 sandwich and soup special or salad. . . you get to chose from any sandwich (turkey and avocado is always great) on the menu and the soup special or a garden salad or Cesar salad.  perfect amount of food. I also really like their salads. . . I have had the salmon and cous cous salad which is great and the Chicken and Gorgonzola salad which is also very good. The reason they did not get 5 stars is because sometimes their service is pretty slow. . . i have a feeling this is due to the lunch rush.","Pros: Awesome vegan food! Nice variety. Warm, friendly staff. Favorite menu items: supreme pizza burger, mushroom burger, Italian pannini. Order everything with extra \"cheese\" and a side of pesto. The pesto is amazing and makes everything taste heavenly. . Cons: No bathroom! Wtf??!!!! No parking. Only deliver before 6pm. Menu doesn't change. Never have carry out menus available. No bar or atmosphere. Closed Sundays. . . What to do: View menu online. Order carry out (remember: extra \"cheese\" and pesto!) and devour at home, or wherever you may be able to enjoy a \"refreshment\" and the use of a bathroom.","I have visited this Pizza Hut a few times but my last experience pushed me over the edge. I stopped in for lunch-they offer a buffet. $5. 99 for all you can eat pasta, pizza, and breadsticks along with one side salad. It's actually a good deal IF, and that's a big if, there is pizza available. . As mentioned before I have been to this location multiple times for lunch and each time has gotten worse. It is not uncommon for all pizza, pasta, and breadsticks to be gone on the buffet. The employees should know there is going to rush at lunch time and plan accordingly. Not sure if they need to prepare more pizza in advance and keep it warm or have more staff to make pizza for the buffet and other orders but improvements are needed. . Moving onto the staff, these employees are some of the worst I have ever seen. Drinks are not refilled, plates are not cleared, and checks are not brought. I had to walk to the counter to request more water as well as request my bill. It is not uncommon for tables to remain dirty/piled with plates until there is no other seating available and the staff is forced to clean. . Long and short this Pizza Hut has a lot to improve on. I would highly recommend avoiding them during lunch.","Yo yo yo all my yelp friends I went to Giordano's tonight and for me personally it taste like frozen pizza . I was not a fan . On a positive note the hostess and servers are all top notch . As always if you go enjoy and let me know what you think .","Never again! What a waste of money! My son graduated from high school and we decided to celebrate at Dave &amp; Buster. Making the plans was great with the manager, Laura; and I figured it was going to be a great place to celebrate my first born's accomplishment. Our package included food and game cards for everyone; as well as a sectioned off corner of the place. At first, the man that greeted me was really nice; but when I went to give him complain about the food being cold- he completely changed. Mind you, everyone is traveling from out of town. Everyone is hungry and ready to eat. The fries were cold and nasty; chicken bites cold; pizza bites cold; Mac and cheese cold. . and the soda pitchers all contained watered down soda. I asked him when was the food set out and he said it was set out 6-10 minutes before we arrived. Lies. So he replaced some of the items. When I went to pay, I told him I will not be paying the entire \"suggested tip\"; as I was not very happy with the service and his attitude and once again, he proceeded to give me an attitude telling me about all the discounts he had given me due to my complaint. Excuse me? There's no discount in the world that could fix the way he was talking to me and their nasty, cold food! So, the next day or so, I emailed Laura; who apologized to me and said she would get back to me within a day or two of talking to the host. Three weeks have past and Laura has not gotten back to me. Case closed. Never again.","Enjoyed dinner on Thursday and it was nice to get a table immediately as it's usually a long wait. The Jalape\u00f1o appetizer was a unique creation and pretty tasty. First time having a pizza with cauliflower crust and I do recommend it. Dylan was our exceptional server and he deserves acknowledgement!  The only thing that turned us off was watching a female waitress wipe up a spilled drink on the floor with a white towel then proceeded to wipe the chair and lastly wiped the table with the same towel. . . . . WOW!!!  What kept us from being totally grossed out was the bus boy came with his own towel and wiped down the entire table. I guess this is why I never eat anything that falls onto the table as one never knows if or how they get cleaned!","Maybe our hopes were too high from all the positive reviews written on Yelp. Walked a great distance for a \"meh\" meal. The pizza was very good but not \"walk across town\" good. Cap rede salad was below average. However, the dipping sauces mentioned in other reviews were fabulous.","I'd give the food an A+. The price of the food for the quality and quantity you get is amazing. . Bad parts, it's insanely loud in this place. Not sure if it has to do with the layout or what. Not crazy about the bar being in the same room as the eating area.  . Service was good but also chaotic and was overcharged. . The menu is ok, seems they are pushing salads and pizza more then entrees. They could use 3-5 more pasta dishes and some kind of beef dish. . This place is for sure for the younger crowd, which could be good and bad.  . I'd probably hit this place up once a month just for the food. . Their beer and wine selection pretty much sucks, hopefully they can expand it.","This is a fast food joint inside the Plaza hotel. You order at the counter and there's seating in front of the counter. It's very clean. . The pizza and onion rings were good! We got Hawaiian and one with lots of meat. Would definitely go back when I'm at the hotel.","Try harding at it's best. 17th ave (and Calgary on the whole) is being flooded with \"monkey see monkey do\" restaurants. This one is not an exception. Great location, great space. . . except for the fact that there is ALWAYS a lineup for the washroom. . Staff there (this summer - July) did not know the menu, and two of the pizza's we ordered were EXACTLY THE SAME LESS 1 INGREDIENT. I think that's a little weak for a new menu. . . . . . Anyway. They tried to fix the situation, which was nice. . For eating in a parking lot surrounded by boards off of 17th ave. . ambience outside get's a 3/10. . the rest. . . . . just not original or well executed. . Disappointed because it looked to have potential.","Nellos Ahwatukee, . Stopped in after a hard day, and got a pizza to go. . One of the most tasteless pizzas I have eaten, (ate only one slice). . Asked my wife how hers was, she said eh. . Have eaten here before. As I recall, it was much better. . I could've gotten more flovor from Dominos, or Pizza Hut, although the flavors not good, at least, you got flavor. . Noticed alot of people got various toppings, I didn't. . I think if you get a good pizza, it should taste good plain, to start with, then add toppings. If it dosen't, the pizza's goin to be mediocre at best. . Try Florencias on Ray Rd. much much better, regardless of toppings.","We had dinner reservations at Crush for Christmas. It's the restaurant that took over the space where Nobhill used to be. It had big shoes to fill, but we were hopeful since it's owned by Michael Morton who is also the co-founder N9NE at the Palms. The restaurant has a rustic chic garden feel. It wasn't too busy on Christmas eve, despite other restaurants being quite crowded. We had a booth in back after asking not to be seated at the high-top bar tables near the entry. . They offered a nice blend of cocktails, wines and beers. We had Kronenbourg Blanc ($9) and Oro di Milano Riserva ($14), on the pricey side, but I appreciated the rare selections. The menu follows the current trend of small plates and specialty pizzas with a few large plate selections for those who prefer the old school way of dining. We started with the ricotta gnocchi with braised short rib ($16). It's offered as a small plate, but we shared as an appetizer. It's hardly enough for two, but quite enjoyable. The shortrib was rich and decadent. The gnocchi was tender and light, though it had less ricotta flavor than anticipated. . We each ordered large plates for our entrees. My husband chose the Lamb Sirloin with Brussels Sprouts ($38) and I had the Seabass with Kale ($34). Large plate portions are not for hearty appetites but definitely an upgrade from the small plates. He really enjoyed the Brussels sprouts, and the lamb was tender and cooked medium rare as requested, but there was a flavor that was off putting. He barely touched it. The waiter took notice and offered something else from the menu. After some urging, he chose the wild mushroom pizza ($16). . The pizza was pretty darn good. The crust was nice and crisp, the fontina was creamy and paired well with the earthiness of the mushrooms. . My seabass and kale was prepared and served in parchment paper. It was topped with a tomato chutney. The flavors were good, but the texture overall was one note; mushy. It would've been better with some crunch. I tend to prefer fish with a nice sear. . While dinner might not have been top notch the staff was very accomodating. They went out of their way to be sure we were satisfied. I give them props. They sent out a complimentarty Nutella Crunch dessert for the trouble. Hazelnuts and nutella are a match made in heaven. The dessert did not disappoint. . Crush has only been open a few weeks so they may hit their stride given more time.","Atmosphere is great,  love the open ceilings, covered outdoor seating and the decor is interesting. The food however fell short, I don't understand the hype. The hand cut fries are far from the best, Boardwalk Fries, Smash Buger, Five Guys, etc. all has them beat. They remind me of trying to make them at home with the wrong equipment, flavorless. Their famous sandwiches also fell short of flavor,  way to much starch when they combine their thick Italian bread and the fries pilled on top your choice of meat. I had the favorite Pitts-burger and was very disappointed, no flavor, the meat was mush and topped with the fries it was gross. The pizza however was good.","Hard to find firstly. Bathrooms not in restaurant but down the hall and not very good signage. . Was late for my reservation as the weather was horrid and was apologizing to the greeter when she kind of cut me off and said 'welcome to the club. ' Not sure what she meant and thought it was rude. . The food was amazing thank God! Great thin crust pizza and the caprese salsa was really fresh and the mozzarella excellent! . Would return to try more dishes.","My husband and I visited NYPD pizza yesterday. We decided on dinner there due to a groupon we had. We had a great waiter. Very friendly and didn't seem rushed. We started with the zucchini sticks for an appetizer. The pieces of zucchini were crispy and fresh. Very good. We also had the SoHo salad. It was so good! I would definitely get that again next time. It was a salad on top of a crisp like pizza crust! It had feta, almonds, bruschetta and a really good dressing. I would recommend that to everyone!! We also got a small white pizza. We were pretty full by then, so we had left overs. But that pizza was really good too. You get a choice of spinach or tomatoes on the pizza, we chose spinach. Very good!  We are always impressed with NYPD pizza and are so glad it is so close to our house!","Really good NY style pizza! I got a cheese pizza and the crust was amazing! My kids really liked it. There are several other Italian dishes that I can't wait to try. The staff was friendly too.","Excellent. Had burger and fries and both were awesome. Also ordered a pepperoni pizza. Perfect NY style pizza. Only problem was I ordered more than I could eat. For the price, I expected much smaller portions but the bacon burger was huge and came with a ton of fries. That was more than enough for my meal but adding the pizza was going overboard. It was so good that I tried my best to finish it all. Oh well, the pizza will be a great leftover snack. Also I want to add that the delivery driver was nice and friendly. Very polite. Overall a great experience.","Ordered the Large Boston pizza special. Delivered to my hotel quickly, total $24. Better than $13 pizza slice at the casino on the strip. Boston pizza special was delicious, i would order from them again","I stayed here for 3 days over an event and it was fabulous!. Since I was at the hotel pretty much all the time, it was a great experience. . The lobby is gorgeous but cozy with lots of interesting artwork. . The rooms are nice, well decorated but hard to find outlets near the bed, overall room needs more lighting. Comfy beds!. The service/food is excellent. All our meals were catered by the hotel and did not disappoint! Lunches were my favourite (some of the best and innovative gourmet pizza I've ever had). The servers were mature and friendly, I felt like I was in a different city after some of my recent trips out. . Didn't get a chance to use the other amenities but overall experience was great!","We decided to order pizza from the Fox's Den last night. We ordered a plain cheese Big Daddy size since at $16. 99 it was only $3 more than the 16\" extra large. We also ordered a garden salad &amp; a ceaser salad. I think the total came to around $24. . I have to say the pizza wasn't as good as I remembered (it's been a few years since I had their pizza. ). The tomato sauce was pretty bland &amp; there wasn't a lot of cheese. I think it really needs some flavorful toppings. Also, we got the hand tossed and the crust was a little doughy. . I didn't care for the large rectangle that is the Big Daddy size. It reminded me of Little Ceasers or something frozen. Next time we will stick with the 16\" to see if that is a better choice. ( And we'll get toppings to give it more flavor. ). One positive I can say about this pizza - it was not at all greasy like some of the other nearby options. So, for that reason we would eat their pizza again, but it would not be our first choice.","Hmm. . . not quite what what I was expecting. . We had a voucher for a free slice of pizza and a beer but the line for the pizza \"bar\" was long so we sat at a table. When we asked about the voucher, our waiter (in a rather irritable tone) said we could only redeem it at the bar. After walking off and coming back, he said he could deduct the price of the slice and beer from our bill at the end. . The garlic knots sounded good but instead of pretzel-like things or breadsticks like we thought, they were these little (and I empasize little) balls that were nothing but oil and grease. . The pizza was just average. Typical New York variety where you have to fold it like a taco or eat it with a fork. . Even with the voucher, the bill was almost $60.","I thought it was a good pizza. The lady that worked there was so sweet. She insisted I take a menu, She was like a sweet nonna. . I need to try it again thin crust and well done to give a five star review so STAY TUNED. . The sauce was actually the best part. I thought it was a very tastey sauce.","We had a fantastic dinner here. Our server was very attentive and energetic and very professional. We also got seated right next to the kitchen and they're very spacious spot for 3 people so we really started the dinner off right. . We had a beer, sangria, mojito, and 2 glasses of wine. All of them were fantastic and reasonably priced for this type of establishment. . We started off with the mussels which were juicy, flavorful and served with garlic bread. Although garlic bread by itself was pretty good, I felt like the regular bread they served at the beginning of the meal paired better with the broth. We also ordered a margarita pizza which was great as well. The cheese and sauce paired together very well and the crust was nice and crunchy. . We had the Bolognese and the carbonara pasta as shareable entrees. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauces were delicious. However I like the bolognese better than the carbonara because it had a lot more richer flavor where as the carbonara was heavy. . To end our meal we ordered a Lemon Souffle which was tart and soft. I really enjoyed it. . Overall I really recommend this place for you to try out compared to a lot of the other restaurants available at Mandalay Bay.","While the pizza is decent, the service is not so good. Being told it would be 45 minutes for a pick up order is fine. However, after showing up at about 40 minutes and paying then being told it would still be a few minutes and nothing even 15 minutes later, patience is over. Then after asking how much longer and come to find out our pizza has been sitting on top of the oven since walking in, is just NOT right!! Then after pointing out that we have been waiting an extra 15 minutes for no reason, there was no apology, just \" sorry I didn't see it\". Totally unexceptable! Will never go back. There are plenty of other choices in the area. Not worth my time as clearly they could care less about my time and their mistake!!","Had pizza here a few nights ago with my husband. We were seated next to a loud boisterous group of people who thought this was more if a rowdy nightclub than an eatery. Our waitress kindly offered to move us to a quieter table. The Manager dealt with the rowdy group in a very professional way and we were comped dessert on top of that! Very impressed with their service and professional manner. The food was tasty but we found the drinks pricey. . We would come back and would send friends here.","I didn't want to do this but, the service was that terrible. When we walked in the door there was a slew of people and not a hostess to be found (all of these people including us were just waiting to be acknowledged). When we finally sat down our server seemed nice enough and we ordered our pizza and drinks. The entire wait staff looked like chickens with their heads cut off. We knew the pizza took about 45 minutes. Ours took about an hour to come. When the pizza did arrive - we were not given plates or silverware and the person who dropped it off ran away so quickly that we couldn't even ask. Also, this plate and silverware shortage was happening to all the tables around us. I finally asked someone cleaning a table who told me they had to finish cleaning the table before they could get it. . . . they could barely handle the tables they had in there I don't think stopping to get us utensils and plates would have been out of the question. I finally got up and stole them off of another table because I was so sick of waiting. My toddler starting having a meltdown so it was time to leave after one piece . I still hadn't seen my waitress since receiving the pizza. I asked another server if they could process my payment and grab me a box. My sever finally dropped off the check simply with a \"here\". No thank you, no box. I asked the other server for the box again. The pizza was good but not worth the service . I'll head to Lou's next time","I was in town for the weekend and decided to have a quick dinner with my family. I love Pizza Hut, like love, love them. This one was terrible. The sauce tasted funny and the crust was kind of chewy. This did not even compare to the bad service. . I made an online order and did not receive a call to confirm my order so I called them. They confirmed my order. My husband went to go pick it up. When I got up to get mine I noticed that both pizzas were the same. I called the store and spoke to a manager, she was kind of condesending and made me feel like I was lying. I asked to have the replacement delivered since it was just down the street. She wanted to give me credit and I said no because I don't even live there. She told me it would take 40 mins for it to be delivered and that she would call when it was on it's way. . By then it was already getting late and I was starting to fall asleep. 45 mins passed and there was no call. I was about to call back when I finally got a knock on the door. The driver told me I had a balance due and I said, \"Nooooo. . . \" He said oh, you paid online? I said yes. So he said there wasn't a signature line and he had to get my signature. Then he said, that's funny, there's no delivery charge. I said I hope not. He then asked me if they messed up on my previous order and I said yes, I got the wrong pizza. Then he really pissed me off because he's still holding the pizza and annoyingly says, \"Well I wish they would've told me this was a freebie!\" Why would they tell you that? Does it matter? Do you do something special to it like spit on it before it gets there because it's free? . So rude from beginning to end.","A nice Italian restaurant with good food, and a not-too-pretentious atmosphere (it's a little worse for wear in places). . They've got a proportionately large patio right along Yonge, which is great for up-close people watching, if a bit noisy; on the other hand, the back of the interior is intimate at night, but just plain dark during the day. . Try the spaghetti agli olio, or the pizza con pollo, which has a nice thin (but still chewy) crust, and a great mix of sweet and spicy flavours.","First of all I'm from New York and I have a very high Stanturf the pizza. I am in Wisconsin visiting for business and really just wanted something that I could order in and enjoy. I got the fetalicious pizza along with a side salad. . . And it was so good!!!  Definitely not NY pizza but definitely the second best!  Highly recommended!!","This is as close as a true CHICAGO deep dish pizza should be if your not eating it off of Michigan Avenue! The chain has the correct water balance and imported Wisconsin mozzarella cheese to perfection!! Thanks guys from a Chicago transplant family now living in Arizona.","A fun, unique newer pizza place in town. We had one of the thin crust pizzas which was delicious with pancetta and Brussels sprouts, as well as once of the steel pan pizzas. You guys, you have to try the steel pan pizzas. The crust is made with Spotted Cow (go WI!), and the entire perimeter of the pan is lined with shredded cheese before the crust goes in, making every edge crunchy and delicious with crispy cheese. And the old fashioned wasnt half bad either","J'y suis all\u00e9e \u00e0 quelques reprises et je r\u00e9alise que je n'avais pas encore \"yelp\u00e9\" sur le sujet. J'adore cet endroit. Hier, j'ai pris une pizza aux figues et quelques verres de vin. Les portions sont \u00e9normes et peu co\u00fbteuses. J'ai ador\u00e9 ma pizza. Le vin n'est pas trop cher. Le service est impeccable. \u00c0 deux, vins, taxes et pourboires, 137$","I am not sure why the low stars in the other reviews as this place was great!. It is what it is, a really good pizza place with good service. . I wish it wasn't so late as I would have loved to try the espresso but maybe next time I am in Pittsburgh. . Give it a try. . .","This place has the best thin crust pizza in the city!!! Mmmmmmmm!!!! I have been going to Marcello's for years and have never been dissapointed. The place itself isn't pretentious, very simple d\u00e9cor, almost industrial, but I like that. . The focus is definitely pizza ( with the wood burning oven) but they also do decent pasta. . To be honest, I rarely sit down to eat as it can get crowded, I just call ahead, order, and take it away. This way I can eat the pizza I love and never have the possibility of receiving dissapointing  service :-) you should go! . That's amore!","Best pizza and even better service. We got the small pizza to split and a small salad and it was more than enough. We definitely left full. Our server Tahir was funny, attentive, and made our experience wonderful. Definitely recommend, and definitely will be back soon!","As a Westlake resident, I have tried every pizza place in the city. This is one of my favorites, by far. I really like their salads, they are full of ingredients and above par in comparison to other pizza places. By the way, for $1 you can add extra chicken to them too. I don't even like extra meat, but for $1, I can't resist. . I think their pizza is just delish. It's made with a thicker crust than most, but don't let that scare you away if your into thin crust normally. There is something special about this pie, please try. Also, for free you can add 'turbo' to your crust (or any other flavor you want). It is garlic, butter and parmesan flavored crust and is not overwhelming at all, just a hint of extra flavors. . Crazy sh*t is. . . . at lunch you can get two slices or pie and a 20 oz of soda for $4. So bad (for you), yet so good at the same time.","Yum! Had a Canadian bacon and pineapple deep dish pizza. I was craving a taste of Chicago. Sauce was good and pizza tasted delicious!","Dominos had a deal for $6 medium pizza, which I thought was a good deal and you get two toppings. Went to pick it up and they should have just said $6 small pizza, the box was a small. It serve probably 3 people if they all had 3 pizza each. When I went to pick it up the guy was on his cellphone, but don't worry he was nice enough to put his phone down when I came in. Not worth the savings.","The Expectations: Hotel Ruby Marie was everything I hoped for, plus more. I expected a fun, memorable stay in a kitschy hotel in Madison, and it came with a friendly staff and goddamn delicious complimentary food. . The Reservation: Super easy. We waited until the last second to make plans. Called on Friday mid-morning and made reservations for that night with no problem. I don't know if online reservations are available - it said \"no rooms available\" online so we called to see, and of course there was vacancy. . The Location: The hotel was very easy to find. We took the highway into town and knew where/what we were looking for: a gorgeous red building at the corner of Wilson and Blair. About a 4-5 minute walk from the Majestic and the Capitol. . Parking: We got there around 7pm. Parking was a little difficult in the lot by Essen Haus and Come Back In because it was the dinner rush but we just waited for someone from the restaurants to leave, took about 5-10 minutes. We were able to leave our car there the next day after check-out, just needed to tell the front desk that we'd be leaving it there for the day. . Check-in: We warned them we were checking in late and they told us we'd get our keys from the barkeep in the Up North Saloon on the 1st floor. It was crowded but he attended to us quickly and professionally. . The Bar: Our free drink vouchers (1 per guest) were good during happy hour 3-7pm and they let us use them at 7:30 so we grabbed a quick drink before heading out. Later in the night, we went back to the Up North Saloon to meet a friend, had beer and a little pizza around 11 pm. . The Room: We paid for the cheapest room available, at $150 after taxes, and had a wonderful view of the lake. Everything was clean, the bed was nice, the bathroom had modern furnishings and the shower was very nice (it had one of those giant shower heads). The building had some creaks and groans throughout the night like an old building would and it wasn't bothersome. I don't think there were many other guests because I didn't hear anyone else in the hotel. . The Staff: Laid back and unobtrusive. I don't think they'd have free toothpaste for you or stuff like that that you'd find at a big chain hotel so you just need to manage your expectations. The front desk is closed at night but checking in and out was easy and we had no other problems. It seemed like a do-your-own-thing kind of place, like you're renting an apartment room for the evening and the landlord isn't going to be there to hold your hand. . The Perks: The free drink vouchers were a nice touch but more importantly, we got a complimentary meal at the Come Back In the next morning. You order whatever you want off the menu. That means a steak &amp; egg and skillet breakfasts with wheat toast and potatoes, an orange juice, an apple juice, and a bloody mary with a chaser. For FREE. The friendly server didn't even bring us an itemized bill, she just let us know that gratuity wasn't included in the voucher. . I would definitely recommend this hotel to other Madison visitors.","Nice dark interior, the special stuffed pizza was nice, from the edge in seemed to be sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers, then onions. Tried the Italian beef, good on the smaller side, tons of fries, had mine with sweet peppers and the spicy peppers come like giardiner style with carrots.","This was my first meal in AZ, after I flew in to meet my new boss. It's very good Italian, especially the garlic bread. I like the beer selection too, an important part of the menu as their name indicates. I wish the prices were a little lower because it's near my job so I am more likely to go for lunch, but the food I've had to date has always been good. Their NY style pizza is good, and they have nice desserts too.","This is good local pizza. It doesn't have that pizza chain restaurant feel. The sauce is robust and the taste is wonderful. Fast friendly service. I completely recommend this place.","I came here to grab dinner, but would recommend it instead for lunch as it may be a little light for dinner. . Shared a few things:. -meatlovers pizza. This was okay, but probably my least favorite of the lot. I'm not exactly sure what was \"Armenian\" about this. Maybe the bread was different, but the toppings  were pretty standard. It was $10, which was okay. . -cheese pizza ($7). Preferred this to the meatlovers. They added some spices that complimented the cheese well. . -the joun was tasty and great value (around $5. 5). I can't remember which type I got, but it had a good combination of flavors. The guy working there said that this is a similar size to the pizza, so this was the best value imo . Overall, I was pretty happy  with the food. I think I'll stick to the jouns on future returns.","Just moved to the area looking for the perfect pizza. . We decided on Brunos and I'm happy we did ! First off the costumer service is excellent ! Mark made us feel welcome and was so friendly !. I ordered a medium half Hawaiian and half pepperoni. Hawaiian side was def our fav but the pepperoni was good as well. The cheesy garlic bread was ok. . We will come back for sure !","The service was mediocre at best, and unfriendly. The pizza is far from famous. I ordered a slice of pepperoni to go and my order was placed on a paper plates and the placed in a paper bag with no other covering. By the time I drove 2 mikes back to my destination it was cold and tasted as if it were previously frozen. . Will not be returning here. . .","Went here with a friend who had been raving about their 'gourmet' pizza for months. She only knew of the one in Mesa but I stumbled upon this one while out for a ride on my bike, motor-less. Decided to take her there for a couple reasons a) cuz she's pretty cool and b) cuz if I don't like it I can totally rip on her and her tastes. . But dang! I really loved this place! So what if I'm in search of the best pizza in a city new to me? This pizza was so good I couldn't even bother comparing it to my fave 'back home. ' . We split a chicken caesar salad. The dressing was tasty and I really enjoyed the pulled-style all white chicken. Then onto the pepperoni and mushroom pizza. I loved how thin and crispy it was, the pepperoni was of really exceptional quality but it literally comes down to the sauce. Yeah, it's not just a catchy name for the joint; it makes the pizza!. My only complaint would be the selection of beer. Wine is becoming more and more accessible and I can totally get on board with the idea of wine and pizza or wine and just about anything else, but sometimes I want a beer. They have maybe 6 brands of beer and some are totally appropriate, such as Peroni. I just would like to have seen a bigger selection. . And I think someone else has mentioned the fact that the restroom is very small; true. It wasn't crowded when we were there so I think I'd be pissed if I'd been drinking and it was crowded and I did need to go. Other than that, I really dig this place and can totally see myself going back for a casual dinner or even making the little trek for lunch.","Char is as good as it gets! Every pizza there is amazing! I am a huge fan of the white pizza but have also tried several others. They even do gluten free for those who need it! Staff are polite and take the time to listen to customers. Anyone who wants an authentic Italian pizza needs to come here!","On our adventure home from the Pirates game we wanted to eat dinner but avoid the city rush so we ventured to Monroeville and well how can you go wrong with pizza?. We were seated very quickly and the hostess was super friendly. We showed up on the right day because there is live acoustic music on Wednesdays and the guy was great. . Our waitress took our order fairly quick and the pizza came out super quick. We had a picky eater with our group so we just ordered the large pepperoni pizza which was good. Personally I'm not a fan of chunky sauces so I scraped the tomatoes off and on to my plate. I felt it lacked a lot of flavor and I needed to dip it in something . . . Anything. It was inexpensive and worth the stop to avoid traffic. I would go back without my picky eater and try another pizza for sure this time without red sauce and the meatballs other customers got looked fantastic.","FYI: Their pizza \"patio\" is NOT dog or even kid friendly. After we sat down outside and the waitress took our drink orders, she came back out to tell us that the dogs were only allowed to be tied up on the outside of the patio. She also added that kids weren't allowed on the patio either. There were no signs saying any of these rules posted inside or outside at the patio. If you're looking for a nice outdoor patio to bring your kids or furry friend and enjoy a nice drink or meal. . . this isn't the place.","Edible but nothing to rave about. . Really, were some of you guys drunk as fuck when you ate this or published reviews? I was expecting a delicious white spinach pizza. . . but noooo just cheap cheap below average pizza. 3$ a slice of white spinach.","My husband and I have had pizza from here two times already and both times it's been really good. We will continue to order pizza from here.","Breakfast pizza, turkey club and espresso drinks at the right temperature.","Swung bye with some friends for lunch and decided to up the rating to 5 stars. I love the simple regina pizza with smoked buffalo mozzarella. The burst of tangy tomatoes combined with smoky cheese is a definate comfort food. . On this occasion I sampled their house made mozzerella cheese plate with all the meat choices. Spicy salami and prosciutto are the winners for me. Also their mozzerella is the best I have had and look forward to having its salty goodness again. . I also tried the connoli, but like their tiramisu I am not of fan of the current dessert recipes and hope they improve them to same standard as their pizzas. . Thanks Novanata for the delicious meal.","I feel sorry for your arizonans, who while having an enormous amount of places to eat at, have to settle for such mediocrity. Here in LA these restaurants wouldn't stand a chance of staying in business for this reason. . Visiting friends recommended this place as \"great\" and so we had take out, which in all fairness does affect food quality. But this is pizza, probably the best takeout food one can order. Ordered the BLT pizza and it was a monstrosity. Picture bacon on a sauceless pie, with a side order of shredded lettuce and tomatoes with a ramekin of mayonaise on the side!. That is exactly what this dish is. Disgusting!  Whoever in their right mind thought mayonaise on a pizza was a good idea needs their head examined. . Also ordered the strawberry and gongonzola salad which was edible, just not great. Prices were the best part of this place, a bad attempt at knocking off CPK(which I wish we went to). Calories are too precious to be wasted on bad or mediocre food. Avoid this place if you agree. . . . .","The stuffed pizza slices are the bomb- it's basically a thinner version of a deep dish style pizza, with cheese and meat stuffed between two crisp layers of crust. They're around $5 each and easily make a lunch, served with a cup of marinara for dipping. . The salads and pastas here are not their forte- maybe it's just the dressing, but the antipasto salad had ample toppings but nothing interesting going on flavor-wise. Meat quality seemed just so-so, and the \"house italian\" looked like it was packed with herbs but tasted more like plain oil. Fellow diners who opted for pasta specials mentioned that they were overcooked and mushy rather than al dente as expected. . They have a limited list of lunch specials ($7, five options) and outdoor dining tables with umbrellas. Though it's set up as though you walk in and order, then wait for your food to be brought out, they only do takeout orders at the counter and if you are dining in, you have a server. Beer and wine are available.","This is my favorite pizza joint in Surprise. We have been ordering from here for years and are just so impressed with the quality of the pizza &amp; wings. Haven't had any issues with customer service or our orders. My mother who lives in North Phoenix has me order it every time she comes out because she thinks it's amazing as well. Wings are on the spicy side as a heads up!","I'm here on a Wednesday afternoon, 2 pmish. I should always trust my gut instinct, but I didn't! Dumb on my part. I always like to sit at the bar. As soon as I got near the bar, it hit me. You know, that smell! The nasty smell that tells you the bar isn't cleaned well. Stale, old beer smell! Ughhhhh. Sure enough, the bar, my chair are sticky. Disgusting. The stainless steel coolers, sinks, counter tops should be shiny &amp; clean. You can see sitting at the bar, the grime on them! . Bartender is very nice &amp; friendly! I ordered lobster pizza and lobster bisque. The pizza is ok, but the lobster bisque is awful. Bland, tasteless, no texture (so I'm not sure if there is even pieces of lobster in it?). I even grabbed Saltine crackers to put in it, but guess what? Crackers are stale? Newks ( a sandwich chain) has incredible lobster bisque and they are a deli! Great taste, texture, pieces of lobster in it, yet this is a seafood restaurant serving this microwaved canned tasting bisque? . Corporate has to do something about this Red Lobster! It's in a heavy traffic location , but is a very very poor restaurant! I never understand why any restaurant GM is ok with a dirty bar area, with a nasty smell? Must be he/she just doesn't care? And if anyone from corporate stepped in here and is ok with this condition, then shame on you! It has to be about more than profits &amp; the bottom line! . Lastly, Red Lobster, you can brush aside my review and say \"whatever\" and it's just a pissed off customer! Or you can take feedback and do something about it? The \"balls in your court!\"","One of my favorites!! Love the food. I have tried most everything on their menu. My favorite is the Chicken Philly. Their pizza's are good as are their burgers. The staff is like family and they pour a great drink. I always recommend this joint!","I try to make it a point to eat at as many different restaurants as I can when I am in Vegas. This time, I found my way to Riva by Wolfgang Puck by the Venetian pools. . THE MOOD:. The restaurant is located in the middle of the hub bub of the Venetian pools. Riva is prime location because it is a bit elevated from the pool deck so you get to soak up sun and people watch at the same time. The Vegas sun can be awfully hot, but not to worry, there is mist that is gently sprinkled as you eat and umbrellas. . THE FOOD:. I ordered the Margherita Pizza, but they ended up giving me a plain cheese pizza. I don't usually send food back, so I just went ahead and ate the pizza anyways. . . Meh. I also ordered a Bellini. Andrew D. got an omelet with potatoes. The food overall was average tasting. Pizza was a bit on the oily side and crust was really hard. Andrew D's omelet was not extremely tasty either. . THE 'TUDE:. The hostess in the front is great at what she does. We were walking by the restaurant and she was great at convincing us to have a seat in the shade from the sun. As for the waitress we got, she was super slow in coming around and I don't believe she ever checked in on us. Not only that, but we had to wave her down for our check. . OVERALL:. Great location for people watching at the Venetian Pools and getting some shade from the hot Vegas sun, but the overall food and service is average.","It's inside F. A. M. E. located at the Linq and probably a 4 minute walk from the High Roller Ferris Wheel. If you use your GPS and type in Linq Ave it will direct you to the street you need. We parked in Valet. From there you walk up to cobblestone street once you go past the beautiful water fountain it's on the right hand side across from the pizza place. Look for the sign F. A. M. E. It's right as you walk in. . Now to get to the food! I'm not much of a adventurous person, I like some Japanese cooking &amp; my boyfriend raves about the food truck meets. He brings all his friends from out of town to try it. Heck even a friend of ours from Rhode Island visited and even HE said it was delicious. I know the food truck has quite a major following on their Facebook page!. I ordered a number one burger no tomato, onion, ginger. I added BACON &amp; Shiitake mushrooms (additional toppings are $1. 99 EACH). Togarshi Garlic fries have a little KICK to them, but nothing I can't wash down with a Pepsi (32 oz. 3. 49). Togarshi Garlic fries come with a side of crack sauce, it's very addicting. The sauce came on my burger and I really loved the flavors. This place is far from bland. You grab your own drinks, no waiter service which is fine with me. . I really enjoyed eating here and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a shock to the taste buds. Also F. A. M. E. has free Wifi if you're interested. I'd like to come back.","Super high quality pizza, clean, and very relaxed atmosphere. I'm a big pizza fanatic and this place is top notch.","It was my Friend's birthday this Saturday and her husband arranged a private group event for 3-D Dodgeball. . I was really excited because it was something new that I have not tried. However, there is always good  and BAD!. The GOOD, we got what we came for. . . Trampolines. We booked an hour session for 7:00pm to 8:00pm. Our session included pizza and pop in the skybar as part of our package. The trampolines was fun because we had 24 people in our group (no matter how bad the situation, good company makes everything). We had a 3-D dodgeball court to ourselves (20 minutes, instead of an hour). . Well, we have more BAD than good. The staff was unorganized and rude! They cut our session short and blamed us for being late when we arrived at 6:30pm. They won't own up to their mistake because all they see is the orange sticker with session time. If we knew, they were unorganized, we would come an hour early. We even had all our friends do an online waiver prior to arriving to speed the process. We didn't get onto the court till 7:30pm because we were waiting for staff to give us an orientation and another group was on the court that we've booked. We had to explain to multiple staff to get our hour session when they cut us off at 20 minutes and told us to go to the open court with no dodgeball. We had a team member to monitor our group to ourselves but he kept on disappearing and other team members was saying our time was up and we had to move to another court. We were wasting our time transitioning from one court to another more than once because staff said we shouldn't be here. At that moment, we were all all annoyed. . The food was just like Chuck E Cheese. We got pizza and pop (coke, sprite, and ice tea). The pizza overall was good, however the pop was water down. . The decor needs improvements because it looked tired and dull. Not a nice place for nonparticipants (parents, friends, and children) to sit around. The skybar smells like B. O. and there was no air conditioning. The parking lot had tons of pot holes. The washroom was smelly and dirty (no place to change). . This is a sweaty sport, so we brought a change of clean clothes but went straight home to shower because we couldn't bear to change in the bathroom. . Surprisingly, trampoline was exhausting!","Sad to see a staff take down a restaurant that does have good food. The menu is a mix of comfort food that is perfect for the location catering to pens fans and pgh downtown happy hour patrons. Unfortunately, the staff is extremely unprofessional and you feel like you are there to get yelled at or get a poorly drawn tattoo. . Even the management seems like they have been plucked out of a bad 90's biker gang movie. From going there three different times with three different groups of people I can make the assessment from observation that the bartenders, waitstaff and manager are inarticulate, abrasive and reluctance to provide service. . The good reviews are most likely fake. Go to Easy Street in the oxford building for even better food and fabulous staff. If you are confined to close to that area pick Milano's for the pizza and subs, Red Ring or even Friday's.","I've been to this brew house a couple times with my boyfriend. The selection of beer is great and the food is very tasty. . We've tried the Diavolo (spicy sweet taste) and Margherita pizzas. . . and the Southwestern pasta decent size portion. . The times we've gone we have always sat at the bar and the service was great, the bartenders are attentive and friendly. . I just wish they were open later especially on the weekends. . . . the kitchen closes early even on the weekends I believe the kitchen closed at 10pm, so you need to make it there early if you want to order food.","This once great pizza has gone downhill to a point where they might as well close this last one up. I am writing this while my insides are  in great distress after eating one of their pizzas. Never again will I be so stupid to eat from there again.","This is the forth Grimaldi's that we have visited and the pizza is amazing. Be sure you give yourself the experience of eating one of their pies.","Great staff, we go all the time. Pizza is always good. We don't order online because it's to hard to judge wait time. Glass nickel does cost more than the chains because its a quality pizza/sandwich/salad","ehhhh it's alright. . They have a good bbq chicken pizza. Spotty service and drinks.","Hooray!  At last a restaurant within walking distance. Luigi's is good. We tried salad, pizza and pasta dishes. I am very particular about pizza crust -- always hoping for that  New York/New Jersey thin crust, which is thin but flexible and tears rather than crunches. Luigi 's comes pretty close, with nice slices of mozzarella and basil. The pasta may not have been cooked in salted water, which left it bland. Further, the pasta was a shade over cooked for my taste. All in all, Luigi's is a much welcomed and tasty addition to the neighborhood!  Can't wait to try the paninis and the make your own cannolis.","I was in that bad place that we all find ourselves in while in Vegas - hungry at 9:45pm, but not wanting a buffet or sit-down time-sink and resulting food crash before hitting the tables. We were at The Venetian, so I figured the food court would be just the ticket. Wife got a pizza, but I wanted something more substantial - Towers Deli looked like the spot. . I wandered in, drawn by the photos of massive sandwiches, and ordered what had to be awesome - the Italian Stallion. Advertised as a plethora of Italian meats and cheese, with a walnut pesto spread on ciabatta, I ditched the ciabatta for rye and added spicy brown mustard - and was expecting a sandwich that lived up to its name. That didn't happen. . What I got was a smallish looking deal, with thin layers of meat. Frankly, I was pissed, and promptly went and ordered something else from Nathan's to supplement the meager looking sandwich. I warned my wife that a vicious Yelp review was forthcoming, and sat down in a surly storm of indignation to eat my $11 tea sandwich. . I took a bite, fully expecting to be disappointed, when the flavors hit. . This was a fantastic-tasting sandwich. I cannot emphasize that enough. The meats were excellent, seriously top quality and each variety standing on its own. If you want good deli, hit Towers Deli, but order two sandwiches if you're hungry. . Towers Deli would get 5 stars if they made a deli sandwich like NY makes a deli sandwich - tall, meaty, filling and deeply satisfying. Towers has the quality and taste down, they just need to adjust the quantity.","I've been eating here for years and the quality has never changed. Their food is delicious, and when you're looking to grab a quick bite for lunch, you can't beat two slices and a soda for $3. 99. Ordering a pizza for dinner is never a bad idea either. I'll definitely continue coming here for years to come.","I've heard very mixed reviews of this place, but then learned it was under new management, so decided to check it out. Staff were super friendly and helpful. The pizza was probably some of the best pizza i've had since New York City. Would definitely recommend.","Stopped by this place twice and they had shut the kitchen about half an hour before closing time, which was  really annoying. . Gave it a third shot; third time lucky and all and really glad I did. The pizza here is the most authentic pizza I've tasted outside of Italy. It really is a true taste of Naples. . The service here is awesome, very knowledgeable and attentive staff. . Also, they serve this amazing chilli sauce with their bread; it's delicious.","This is my favorite of the Squirrel Hill pizza shops. You can get a quick slice and pick up a 6 pack as well","I ended up here for a quick bite and loved the service, the cute patio, and the casual atmosphere. It turns out the white pizza is great and an incredible bargain at ten bucks for a large. I have been back twice in the last couple of weeks and will make this a regular spot. The more formal Pasta Brioni next door has the same great food in a more romantic setting with a beautiful patio as well.","It's pretty good pizza for the price they charge and accurate on the time frame when order for delivery. . I order the Pizza Fiesta and the Fettuccine Alfredo I also wanted wings but they didn't have any at the moment but it was still pretty good.","I was pleasantly surprised to visit Sharkys after getting a Mailer! This is probably the only mailer I haven't immediately thrown in the recycle bin! The nachos were huge. It was like a 20\"-22\" pizza sheet with nachos instead of the pizza. Next time no beans- i didn't finish it all but if there was no beans I would've- otherwise it was a meal worthy of my appetite","My memories of pop up pizza are fond. . . and fuzzy. . After a long night of gambling, cigars, drinks, and thankfully winning, my friends and I were famished. Unwilling to leave the sweet embrace of the casino we stumbled to pop up pizza, conveniently located near the slots.  . I remember fried pickles. . . . and there not being enough, but they were tasty. . We shared the Fremont. Lots of veggies, lots of meet. Super good. It really hit the spot. Took a minutes to make, because they actually made it, so that was OK by us. . Perfect late night snack.","Great food by some great people. Tastes even better the next day! . I got a simple meat lover's and the place was really busy, since it was a game night. However, the staff was friendly and welcoming, and they genuinely enjoyed working through the rush. . The pizza itself had a more pan style crust, slightly sweet sauce, and the toppings were plentiful. If you're in the area, I'd highly recommend it!","Anyone who knows me well knows that I hate grocery shopping. Hate it. Recently I was introduced to Trader Joe's and this past weekend, I took my husband there for the first time. While I can't say I have fallen in love with grocery shopping, I have found that I can at least go to TJ's when need be. . The layout of the store is fabulous. It's just a big enough store to give you variety and some choices, but not big enough to overwhelm you, especially if you are not a seasoned grocery store veteran. The staff is very friendly and always willing to help you find something, and the check out clerks are chatty without being annoying. I really can't compare TJ's prices to those you would find at a regular big box grocery store, but according to my husband who does all of our grocery shopping and knows which stores are the best for certain items, he says that TJ's prices are comparable if not lower than other grocery stores. . I like the pre-packaged salads, sandwiches, and wraps, which are perfect to take to work for lunch. In fact, I had a TJ's chicken caesar wrap for lunch today and it was delicious! Do make sure to check the dates before purchasing to ensure that if you aren't going to eat it that day that it will last for a few more days. The organic pesto pizza that can be found in the frozen section is also very good and just the right size for two people. I was a little disappointed in the Red Delicious apples that I bought (nicely priced at 49 cents each). . . they didn't have the crunch to them that I appreciate, but I'm not sure if it was the quality of their selection or that I just did a crappy job of picking two apples. . This TJ's does seem to be quite popular especially given it's location in the same shopping center as Changing Hands and Wildflower, so if you go on a Saturday, I would suggest going early. We arrived at 11 am and it was quite busy and the parking lot was almost full.","So. . . you all know me and my love of food. The new owners of Mama's on Idlewild by 485, he is a graduate of Johnson and Wales, cooked in Italy AND if you want to custom make a dish - YOU MAKE FUN OF ME FOR IT BUT (I'm infamous lol!)  - but he LOVES custom requests!!! He says he likes when someone comes in and challenges him with an order. . Where can you get that in Charlotte/Matthews/Mint Hill area?! As for catering they do it all even six foot subs. The pizza is really, REALLY good. If you give him at least two weeks notice (more I think for Mozzarella) he can MAKE home made Cavatelli, Gnocchi, Mozzarella. I was like, \"WHAT!? How did we all not know this?!\" . So. . . please, the food and service is amazing already but to make home made pasta and mootz - you can't beat it!  He enjoys fresh ingredients, I loved their version of Cavatelli as it is healthier than the one I grew up with that was buried with butter lol! But they can make it that way too. I love the idea of chopped mozzarella over the top - which is when he said they can make it home made. . Oh, and I had the Limoncella Marscapone Cake tonight as a 'sample' --- holy cow, AMAZING. They hope to eventually be able to make their own pastries/cakes but this one is to die for. Creamy, light, lemony - I LOVE marscapone cheese and a lot of places don't do it because its expensive or not as much in demand. MUST HAVE DESSERT!. Do yourself a favor, whether you are from up North or here as a local, great Italian food, service is amazing, timely and gracious. They get to know you on a regular basis by name just like the old days where, \"everybody knows your name. \" . Truly can't beat fresh Italian 'new' food and classics in the local area! Can't wait to do a catering order with them, trust me you'll love the fantastic service, quality of food, a great meal for your money. Enjoy while you can because at this rate this young man will be expanding - just hope we don't lose him any time soon!","Ordered food for delivery, was told it would take 45-55 minutes, no problem. Called after an hour to ask about my order, and was told the driver was late but the food was ready, and it would be at my door in five minutes, a little irritating, but no big deal. 20 minutes pass and still no pizza. I called again, this time to cancel the order because I'm not waiting  for an hour and a half to get cold food. Fuck that. Then the owner shows up *IN UNDER 5 MINUTES* and starts spewing shit about a discount. Never ordering here again. Glad my dog was with me so he wouldn't come close to the door.","I almost feel bad for leaving two stars because the staff were very friendly, however the whole experience was a little underwhelming. And let me section it into groups to make this review easier to find what you're looking for. . Food:. My boyfriend and I got the penne al vodka and the pizza al cazone to share. . The pasta (penne al vodka) honestly tasted like every other pasta i've had and made, it was quite plain and lacked flavour, colour, texture, etc. It didn't taste bad but i have no reason to want to come back for it. . The pizza was more on the underwhelming side but maybe I'm not a pizza master so I shouldn't judge on quality. All i know is the crust was flat, the sauce was plain, the cheese concentrated a lot in the center leaving the outer half naked with sauce. I honestly don't know what was supposed to be on this pizza because it came out looking like your regular cheese pizza. . Cost:. These meals are a little under $20, that's like pickle barrel money. Except the taste is far from pickle barrel. That's all I have to say. . Venue:. If I could redecorate, I would. . Experience:. Aight, so when we walked in first thing was the waitress seemed like she didn't know where to seat us, I've never been a waitress I don't know how restaurants work when it comes to seating so I won't judge too much. When we were seated we were given menus (and this is the part where waitresses get us started on drinks so we have something to sip on while we browse) but she just left. By the time we were ready to order, she came back but only asked for drinks. She gave us our waters and some garlic bread which was kind of her, but then walked away again. After we ordered, my boyfriend and I just talked but we sat at a table that was able to look into the kitchen. WE SAW WHEN OUR FOOD WAS READY AND WE JUST WATCHED IT GET COLD FROM A DISTANCE. When the food got to us it was luke warm. We were offered cheese and pepper for the pasta. The pepper was grinded, the cheese was in a mason jar for us to pour ourselves and so thats cool, bUT ANOTHER WAITRESS HAD TO COME LATER and she was like \"sorry im going to steal your cheese\". I'm not mad at her but i'm just?? why dont you guys just separate your cheese in small dishes or something. . Feed back for the restaurant:. I've noticed that you guys have a lot of items on your menu and its good to have variety BUT you could really benefit from removing the quantity of dishes and focus on improving the quality of these dishes. It's better to have 3 great dishes that you've mastered well and that your customers are going to love coming back for rather than saying \"hey we have so many choices\" because looking at all of them i dont know where to start. Also seperate your cheese or handle the cheese like you handle the pepper.","REALLY good pizza and the option for the individual size was great since my husband and I prefer different toppings.","Not a fancy spot. Kind of small with six or seven tables.  . I ordered a small pizza to carry out. I was quoted a twenty minute period for cooking. I arrived after 15 minutes as I was driving when I called the order in. I paid and the pizza was out within minutes. Pizza was hot and cooked well.  . I have not been impressed with the delivery service in the past. But I would order/pick up again.","Tr\u00e8s bonnes pizzas ! Assez bond\u00e9 donc il ne faut pas h\u00e9siter \u00e0 r\u00e9server. Ambiance d\u00e9tendue. \"Best pizza in town\" dit une affiche \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e, oui c'est possible.","I had not eaten in about 12 hours since we were at the hospital having a baby. . . and this pizza STILL tasted horrible. . Barely average fast food quality and taste. Avoid!","I've entitled this review, An Ode to Oregano's Pizza: A Love Story. . I can honestly say this is the best pizza I've ever had. It's the only time I've eaten a piece of pizza and my mouth immediately started watering for a second piece. Expensive but worth it. Real Wisconsin cheese, not stingy with the spices and an amazing selection of meat. The only negative thing I have to say about Oregano's is that it is making me gain weight like crazy. Shame on you for making such an irresistible pizza!","If you love thin New York style pizza with lots of flavor this is the place for you! The pepperoni here tastes so much better than other pizza joints! Give it a try!","My family's favorite Ethiopian restaurant. I usually order the spicy combination. instead of the meat combination because it is really just a spicy meat combination. The lunch specials are also a good deal with good portion sizes. My daughter has counted Lalibela as one of her top five favorite restaurants since she could count to five. It was nice to have a restaurant that didn't serve pizza in the top five. She usually has the red lentils even though they are a little spicy. My wife loves the vegetarian combination. And a bottle of honey wine completes the meal.","The decor is extremely trendy, I thought I was going to cool, hip lunch spot for some awesome sushi. . Turns out, the food was pretty bad. I looked around at what other people were eating (yes, I'm nosey) and those who were eating rice, looked like they were eating some Chinese stir fried chicken and a heap of white rice. . So I decided to go with the lunch special- sushi : 7 pcs nigiri and one roll. I asked what the fish was, because it was the chef's choice, the waitress had no idea. Since I eat most kinda of fish, I decided to risk it and see what happened. . Well, the chef's choice is by no means omakase, it means the bad fish that they want to throw away. I was given mackarel I think? And some other horrible tasting fish. Some of the white fish- no idea what it was once again, tasted so bad I had to spit it out. Some parts of the fish had weird hard bits in it and I spit those out too. . I'd rather eat pizza than eat this crap, certainly won't be back.","Came here for a work workshops and I'll probably not come back until they upgrade the basic necessities to please a customer. I was assigned the 27th floor in the habitat elevators. . cons:. -arrived 1130pm to check in.  while waiting for an hour in a long line, my buddy had enough time to buy us two slices of pizza. We finished it and we weren't anywhere closer to the the front of the line. There were 3 employees at the front desk checking in a line that was more than 25 people long. -- take advantage of online check-in if you can. -elevators go to every floor. What does that mean for someone on the 27th floor? Stops at every floor imaginable going up and down. Watching people hop on and off while I wait to reach for the skiies. It's worse going down because it stops at every floor for everyone trying to get the heck out of their floors. . -Advised to keep keycard away from phone. Um. . . it's 2015 and everyone has a phone. I'll need my keycard and phone while I wander the strip and need to return to my temporary abode. My consequence? Keycard denies my entry to my room and I stand in front of my room like a reject. Then I proceed back down the elevator to get my card fixed and go back up. Precious time wasted. . -hot water takes a while to flow. -heater didn't work. pros. -they offer a $7 shuttle direct to airport, picks up every 15 minutes. -central to the strip. -peaceful fish ponds and flamingos","I have heard several times from different people how great this place is. . . i didnt really get it. I was hoping for a local italian restaurant with amazing food for great prices and that is not what i got. The pizza was doughy and bland. The crust had a strange flavor to it also. The service was fine, my only complaint is the food.  i had the fried cheese as well and same thing. . . . it was barely melted and just didnt have hardly any taste.","My boyfriend and I finally found a place that is close to Chicago deep dish pizza! I love the sauce and the crust is just right!! I order here once a week!!! Be sure to oder 45 min a head because you have to wait for awhile for a deep dish.","Let's talk about amazing customer experiences shall we?. The place - Humble Pie Pizza. The Reason - 6 year old Birthday Party. The Server - Mike. So we come here every year for our daughter's birthday. The food is always delicious and I decided to try the shrimp pizza this time (was also good!). Anyway my daughter let go of her balloon. Mike stopped at nothing to get it down for her becoming our Superhero of the day!!!  The entire restaurant cheered him on. . Thank you Mike!!!! You're the real MVP!","I don't go to Jacksons to drink or watch the sports, either through the bar area is quiet and comfortable, I am such a square. I go to Jacksons to eat the PIZZA! The pizza is soo cheesy and covered with toppings! The pizza is excellent! The price is another perfect part of Jacksons. Nice proportion and value","So I was craving sushi pizza yesterday. . Just really wanted some. . Since my friend lives near this sushi restaurant, and we were at the Starbucks just down the street. I got a salmon sushi pizza to go. I decided to call them, and they told me to pick it up in 10 minutes. . Was not very impressed.  1) the salmon was not that fresh; 2) the description was: salmon, spicy sauce, onion, green onion, unagi sauce (what onion and green onions?! I didn't see it!); and 3) the salmon was strangely warm by the time I got it. . Maybe I'll try going for dinner next time. . . Should I try my chances?","Ordered pizza one night while at a friends house hanging out. They are a couple blocks from Caliente. We had it delivered so we could continue drinking on the porch. We just ordered a large pizza and it took over an hour do it to be delivered. The pizza itself was very tasty. It was very saucy but I like it that way. It was priced a little high for a large pizza especially when it took so long to deliver.","Good food and very good prices. I've tried the pizza, lasagna, and a chicken parm sandwich. All were terrific. If you're used to Pizza Hut, you're used to a different kind of pizza. Mama D's pizza is New York style, thus the East Coast transplants (like me) probably appreciate pizza that reminds them of what they grew up with. The services isn't the fasted and your food might take a little longer than expected, but as the sign says at my mechanic, \" You want it cheap, good, or fast? Choose 2. \"  Mama D's is good and pretty well priced.","Nello's pizza is a fun place to eat with good food. The service has always been top notch and all of their items are of good quality. I do not enjoy ranch dressing, but the praises everyone sings about it on Yelp rings true with my friends I have brought here who do like it. . I highly suggest everyone in the area come by Nello's and try the food. For me, it's just not my style. The first few times I tried it I love it, but i find myself preferring a more traditional NY style pie. Especially not for the premium price.","After taking a ride on the High Roller we decided it was time to eat. Walking back toward the strip through the lovely promenade we stumbled upon Flour and Barley. We were immediately seated and even got a patio table so we could watch the light show. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped us with decisions. I ordered the Flour and Barley flight of beer. This was great!!!! We ordered an order of garlic cheese bread and a pizza. We couldn't decide between the lasagna pizza or the farm house pizza so I told the waiter to choose one and not tell us until it arrived. This was actually a really fun way to get dinner for the night and the waiter even enjoyed it. . Our garlic bread came. It was great! It wasn't the normal hot dog bun bread you get from your local pizza eatery. It was smothered in cheese and had great flavors. . When our pizza finally came, the anticipation had reached its peak. We received the farm house pizza! Great choice. The waiter said it was the chef's own creation so that's why he chose it. It was wonderful. We even took some home with us!!. Overall this was a great experience and not too overly priced for being on the strip. Recommendation would be two people per pizza. Try some drinks and share an appetizer. We walked out only paying around $50 and that was with a $10 tip.","If it forced to eat one type of food for the rest of my life, it would be pizza. I never tire of pizza simply because there are so many interpretations possible, and I'm not just talking about toppings. From the flavorless cardboard pizzas from Peter Piper (for which I will always hold a place in my heart) to the foodie favorites crafted at world famous Pizzeria Bianco, Arizona is a pizza lovers paradise. But among all of these various pies, my very favorite would have to be the Artichoke Pizza at Humble Pie. . Immediately upon walking into Humble Pie, you are immediately struck by the wood burning oven, where pizzas are being expertly spun in and out and onto your plate. The heat from this oven allows your crust to be cooked within minutes, and produces a smoky black char that adds so much depth of flavor--this isn't the result of neglecting to set a timer. The crust is able to develop this color not only because of the immense heat of the oven, but also because of fermentation of the dough. Fermenting the dough not only aids in the cooking process, but also adds that slightly sour tang you can taste in the dough. Developing flavors over days, rather than hours, is a testament to this restaurant's dedication to quality and taste. . With such a strong base, it's difficult to see how you could screw up such a good thing. While I have enjoyed many different pizzas here, my all time favorite would have to be the Artichoke. Delicate artichoke hearts are accented with gooey fontina cheese, mild fresh ricotta, sweet caramelized onions, with the briny bite of olives to cut through it all. Other toppings range from just as creative to the traditional cheese or pepperoni. But don't let traditional fool you into thinks average. Humble Pie highlights local vendors in their locally made sausages and organically grown vegetables. Anytime there are less miles between the purveyor and your plate, there is almost a guarantee that the flavor will be better. . As for the rest of the menu, the burrata Caprese and antipasto platter starters are two of my favorites, and again highlight simple, quality ingredients. Typically, my dining partner and I will split one of these and a pizza. Salads are okay, but don't quite have the impact of the milky, gooey cheese of the Caprese. I have not had their sandwiches or pasta dishes, but can only assume that with the quality of ingredients being used, there can't be much to complain about. The kids' menu contains the usual suspects, but the pizza is of the same quality of the adult menu.  (Do be aware that the kids' macaroni and cheese is Kraft. ). The service is always friendly, with the owner stopping by your table often, and encourages leisurely meals. I actually chose this venue to host my birthday party, which included around ten adults and four children under the age of five. All of the orders were correct, the quality of food just as phenomenal as always, and they were incredibly helpful with our request of separate checks. Overall, Humble Pie is one of my favorite spots in the Valley to enjoy myself with my family and good food.","Barros Pizza is excellent. This is the first time at this location. It's very clean,  friendly staff,  and consistently awesome thin crust pizza. Service was great as they continued to check on our table. Will be back to this location again.","Pretty good pizza, just a little too greasy. We ordered 6 garlic knots and they were literally swimming in a pool of butter. I also ordered a salad that was 6 bucks, very small and definitely not worth the money. . The main reason I am only giving 3 stars is for the service/or lack there of. Like many other people said, the guys working there are very rude and give off a really bad vibe. I was not feeling the love at all!","Oh. My. YUM!!!!!. I had a coupon for a free pizza (thanks to a Yelp event) and have never been to this place so we decided to make the drive and check it out. Sooo glad we did! . I wish I would have gotten our waiters name, he would have gotten a 1 star. We were seated and sat and sat and sat. It was a Thursday (5/24) at about 6pm, there were maybe 3 other tables with people. NO ONE acknowledged us for a solid 10 minutes. We finally flagged down a bus boy who went and got our waiter. The waiter was not personable at all. Whatev. Although twice a lady brought our food out to us, she was so super nice and we had even said to her that we wished she was our waitress, very personal and nice. . We ordered several things to try since it was our first time. We did an order of wings, an antipasto salad, the mozzarella and then a pepperoni pizza. . I don't eat wings, so I cant say how they were, but they were the biggest I've ever seen and the guys really liked them a lot! . The antipasto was fresh and tasty! We will for sure be ordering that again. Note a small is big enough for 4 people! . The fried mozzarella was super tasty! Very different! Loved it! Not the best I've had though, that award goes to Lo Cascio, but I will for sure order it every time I go! . The pizza was HUGE! A large will easily feed 5 people. It was so different, loved the amount of cheese on it, though I do wish there was slightly more sauce on it, the sauce is soooo tasty! . This will for sure be a repeat place for us!","I used to make fun of the name of this place because what kind of name is \"Super\" Pizza?. I was going to count it as a generic pizza place until I found a coupon on the back of a receipt at Smiths. My gf convinced me to go there and after reading the reviews I figured I should try the pizza (even though most people kept talking about their philly cheesesteak). . With superhero stickers all around the inside, I get where the \"super\" part comes from. We dined in and grabbed a large Pepperoni, Bacon and Ham pizza. On top of that when talking to the waitress they made some cheesy bread sticks (per request) which was really good. It wasn't like my hometown ones but the fact that they attempted something off of their menu which was still delicious was awesome. . As for the pizza. The crust was spectacular all the ingredients were fresh. I don't know what was in the cheese and sauce, but this was pretty much one of the best pizza's I've ever had. I love pizza in general so for me there really isn't a such thing as a bad pizza. But I am a major fan. I can see myself gaining some extra pounds at this place. . Check it out though!","Nello's has been our family's favorite go-to for years. They've always made really great food, and more recently have worked to revamp the menu adding in some new favorites like the Salmon BLT, the Grinder, and of course their market salads and pizzas. If you go there, ask for the Sajone pizza as well. It's a combo of their Salsiccia and Pavone Pepperoni pizzas that are wood fired, and it is delicious. (Don't forget the pork wings too!)","Very good pizza, quick delivery, tasty wings. . . wish crispier","After reading numerous reviews, I came to two conclusions:  the food at Buca is really good but the portions are really small. I prepared myself to be hungry after my meal. Instead, I was full and content at the end. . We started with a board of 4 house-cured meats and one cheese. Very good. Had I known one of the cuts was going to be pure fat, I think I would've substituted that one for something leaner. Very good nonetheless. Pickled accompaniments were a nice addition. . As our other appetizer, we had the cervello. These were two small rolls. The filling was lamb brains, wrapped in deep fried meat (prociutto?). Some people may have already thrown up a bit in their mouths reading \"lamb brains\" or any brains for that matter, but man, this was delicious!  I could've eaten another order (of two) myself. . Duck pasta was really good. The portion looks small but after eating half, you realize the ragout is quite heavy and filling.  . We also shared the red (tomato sauce) pizza with burrata and truffles. This pizza was amazing!  The crust was perfection.  . For dessert, we shared a tiramisu. I'm not a dessert person so it was just ok to me. . Service was very good throughout the evening. However, we just had to wait a little longer for dessert and then we had to wait even longer to get the bill.  . One thing that bothered us was the temperature in the restaurant. There was a bit of a draft making it kind of cool, and as a result, our food got cold really fast. I'm sure it's hard to regulate the thermostat in a converted warehouse-type structure, especially when it's in the basement too.  . All in all, it was a lovely meal for my anniversary. I would still recommend this place even with the few minor setbacks.","This is kind of a neat concept but I've heard people say they order pizza so they won't have to cook. Well, if you order delivery, you have to WAIT, so listen up!. My fiance' and I went in to pick up a couple of pizzas off of their coupon specials. We were greeted at the door by the owner. She walked us through the process (since we had never done this before) which was extremely simple. We ordered, we waited about 5 minutes and our pizzas were ready, freshly prepared right in front of us. . We got home, stuck one of them in the oven (the other in the freezer for later) and it was ready in about 15 minutes. Quicker than delivery!  BEST PIZZA I'VE PROBABLY EVER HAD!  The ingredients were fresh, the crust was amazing and I will be a regular!  . Don't think you want to cook it yourself? Then suffer with the bad pizza deliveries out there, I'm going to Papa Murphy's!  =)","Tried for the first time tonight. Finally some decent pizza in the NH! I great surprise!","Delicious pizza and great service, as always. Plus, free garlic knots. You can't go wrong here. New menu items and great happy hour prices as well.","Plenty of food, great specials and they have a frequent visitor card you can earn points and use toward your future visits. Food has always been great and service friendly. You won't be hungry when you leave this restaurant!  They also offer take out and the pizza's are great!","This is my first review!! . Anyway. . . Humble Pie. My co-worker and I went for lunch today after reading the mixed reviews on here, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I love Pizza, and if it was socially acceptable for me to eat it for every meal, I really would; I think that Humble Pie definitely meets my standards. . We sat outside on the patio, which normally I would love, accept for the mister/fan system combo, which made my straight- but naturally curly hair- frizz up in seconds. I was surprised to see the place relatively empty for 12:15 during the week, but I guess it's still \"new. \" Our server, a young guy, greeted us right away with glasses of water, and had our other drinks to the table in seconds. Note to Humble Pie: if you leave the sweetener packets on the mystified tables- the sugar clumps together and doesn't come out of the packets! . We ordered the Chopped Vegetable Salad to start and it was amazing! Not heavy, a little tangy, a great mixture of veggies (Asparagus, white beans, cherry tomatoes'), and the cheese was amazing! I'm a big fan of the chopped lettuce! . Next, we shared two Pizza's: Chicken Pesto with Leaks and the other was a simple Margahrita. Both, were very good! The mozzarella was fresh, the tomato sauce on the Margarita was tangy and smooth, and the Chicken on the Pesto Pizza was moist and delicious! Everything was seasoned perfectly and the crust had the perfect amount of crunch. . The pizza's are small, so I walked away feeling very satisfied and definitely wanting to go back! I bet at night this place is going to be packed! . Hurray for Humble Pie!!","I had a 14' pepperoni pizza and The best way I could described what the pizza tasted like was little caesars pizza. Wasn't pleasant. . .","Being from Chicago, anytime a Chicago-based restaurant comes to town, I take it upon myself as a challenge to check it out so I can give it my thumbs up or down to my friends. I've has Giordanos twice in the past, once for their fettuccine Alfredo, and once for their deep dish pizza, and the pizza definitely lived up to expectations and I'm glad it's close by. . This evening I ordered a take out of their lasagna and picked it up but was not quite on the size of the order that was told to me to be family size. After talking with the waitress Ebony, I hope I spelled her name right,  who introduced me to Christine, the manager on at that time, and she was very courteous, understanding and professional, just how A manager is supposed to be. She took great care of me and getting my order the way I liked it and went above and beyond the call of duty to complete it. I was not expecting what she did, but I am beyond appreciative of her actions. The old hometown restaurant family style appeal and experience is what she delivered to me tonight and I am forever grateful and a customer for life.","Thai is a great little bar to chill n hang at. They have a poker tournament on Sun, Mon, and Tues and karaoke on Sats. The only thing that's kind of a downer is they only serve wings and pizza (not by the slice).","I go here a lot. I think most folks who live in Regent Square/Swissvale/Edgewood area do too. And it's probably not because the food is so utterly delicious. It's because it's a groovy little place with young hipster (and some not so hipster) bartenders and waitresses that serves up an endless array of beers in a funky loud space. I love Regent Square and always saw the potential for the grand old days of Hippy Free Love lying dormant in her quaint shops and family eateries . . . until D's sprang to life in a former dry cleaner/gun shop space. Oh yes, how the times have changed and we are all so thankful for it. Big KUDOS to the D's Empire in Regent Square -- the Beer Distributor, D's Six Packs and Dogs, and the newest entrant Cibo!  Well done!  Stop on in for a nice hot pizza (I loved the Frickin Parker with meat balls and hot peppers but alas, it has been banished to the basement beer dungeon for-evah!) or a mediocre hotdog and languish in the beer heaven known simply as D's. They also have a smoky dark strange but intriguing (if you've had enough beer downstairs) bar upstairs now that serves alcohol.","The slice of pizza was good. The service by General Manager Vincent was horrible! The location is inside the Linq, potential for better business. But the restaurant was empty and quiet. Vincent was rude and unprofessional. No wonder why they did not have any clients dining in and even the staff looked unhappy. I wanted to dine in but unfortunately we were denied service for a party of four because I had my smoothie drink that had pi\u00f1a colada but because it was an outside drink we were not allowed? Hello - we are in Vegas, everyone is walking around with a drink. Besides the point, the outcome would have been a positive one if Vincent wasn't RUDE! I asked if he was the owner and he said he was it, WOW he should go to Business school to first obtain an education on service and then know how to run a successful business.","The pizza is pretty good. It is one of my favorite places to order from because they usually have a $15 pizza/wings combo.","Went in to see Cubs/ Mets play off game. Very comfortable atmosphere. Chicken wings were excellent. The pizza was just OK. The service with Brashad was excellent.","my husband LOVES this place for pizza.  we often get the pizza and wings deal that there are coupons floating around for, especially when we have family visiting. It's better than little caesars, dominos, etc, but not as good as Vitos. The service is fast and friendly.","Terrible customer service. Ordered pizza took two hours for it to be delivered. Ordered a pizza with various vegetables and found a single piece of pepperoni in it. Which we do not eat. Unless you are a desperate college student looking for food late into the night I would not recommend ordering from them.","Sorry Papa. My pizza was kinda bland, nothing really special about it. Instead of the Supreme maybe next time (if there is one) I'll try one of those specialty pizzas.","Oh my goodness. This is my only pizza experience in this area and I am completely satisfied. . You can order online; my boyfriend set up an order online for me to submit during dinnertime before he left for class. I did and voila, he picked up the food on his way home. . We shared a large calzone full of yummy pepperoni and sausage. The marinara sauce is delishhhh. The calzone is topped with lots of parmesan cheese and oregano (I personally liked the bread more than what was inside. . . lol). . To be honest I felt like I could eat the whole thing despite it being bigger than my face. It's because it's that good and I can only imagine it better after a night of drinking. The food here totally reminds me of undergrad days, when finding the perfect pizza place was like student's greatest treasure. . I don't know about the actual pizza though. Haven't tried that. . Beware though, food is super salty. Because I'm a crazy chick who has that yolo mentality, I'm just like. . . \"yummmm salt. \" This place is obviously not for the health conscious. . . haha","This might be my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. The coffee and treats are good, the pizza is good, and the patio seating is amazing! Great place to go with friends for a casual meal.","Not a bad location, being right next to a handful of different types of food (fast food, bar food, pizza joints) and being 15 min.  to the airport was also a major plus.    . the rooms were typical, of an extended stay (kitchen, \"living room\" and bedroom combo) but I must say that the walls are a bit thin. When you're at an extended stay, you're there for - well, an extended period of time!   So you get to meet those next to you several times . And on this particular trip, I may have gotten a little more familiar than I wanted (and not by choice) . Damn those thin walls. . .   but you got to love a couple in love. . . . Comfy beds, nice staff, good location.","You will thank me for this little tidbit. . . There is a 50% off gift card offer for this location at:. http://www. citydeals. com/location/index/index/id/2910?ref=CDUMTIwNzgw. A nice place to dine in for pizza and fairly tasty pasta dishes. Nice staff at this location. Nice flat screen television for those that just can't break away from the game long enough to feed themselves. . Enjoy!","I ordered the gluten free pizza for delivery. . . After twice the wait time I was told to expect my delivery, my pizza arrived barely topped cold and hard as a rock. When I called, to question the reasoning behind the problems with my food, I was placed on hold, then the young lady that answered the phone said \"since I had the food, they would not refund my purchase. \" This must be the worst service I've received by delivery, and the most absurd response from a manager I've heard.","The pizza is absolutely amazing here, so many fresh ingredients and options to choose from I can literally get a new style of pizza every day. The decor is beautiful,  you can hang out for hours and feel comfortable doing so. The staff is super friendly and very helpful. They also have a beautiful inside/outside bar with a delicious drink menu, local brews on draft and yes even wine on tap, which I love. Great prices for the high quality food that your getting. I will definitely be back to this restaurant","Tried the restaurant for the very first time . My friends have raved about this place for years. Ordered Hawaiian pizza thin cryst. The service was slow . They paid more attention to phone orders than to customers at the restaurant. The pizza was not fully cooked the crust was thin . It was a little light on toppings. The staff  serving me was not very friendly maybe just too busy","so i ordered for delivery even though i live 5 mins away (i am a lazy ass), they estimated that hey would arrive in 1 hour. kind of a long wait for pizza i thought, but they came within 20-30 mins. . i ordered the eugene supreme and mild hot wings. the pizza was good but i realllyyyy liked the wings. i love buffalo wings and usually dont really like the wings from most pizza places but this place i like. . it is kind of pricey for the pizza here but i think it is worth it.","It's a shame so many people are leaving less than 3 stars. The pizza is amazing and my service was fast. Granted, I'm here for lunch during the week, after the \"lunch rush\" but there's one guy serving the whole place and he's doing a great job (there are still quite a few people here Including a large group and a few families). Anyone complaining about kids being here, that is not a ding against a restaurant (I have no kids and enjoy the money I make not spending it on said kids), it's the nature of the neighbourhood - there are a lot of young Toronto families here so it's certainly not worth bringing down the rating of an otherwise awesome restaurant. I love Neopolitan style pizza and used to live down the street from a Queen Margherita - I've had bad wannabe Neopolitan style pizzas (read: I live in Durham region now) and this is not one of them. Thank you for satiating my desire for some good wine and pizza!","As I am a Pitt alum, your skepticism, dear reader, of this review is natural. But still, lend me your ears (err, eyes). Yes, the O is an infamous Oakland institution, your first accidental order of large fries is a rite of passage when you're a Pitt student, the regular employees look like they came out of a slasher flick, the setup is questionable, and the place is dingy as all hell. . Now, all that out of the way, how's the food? Well, it varies. In general, anything they do in-house or get private label is quite good. To elaborate, their fries are cut fresh, their hot dogs are made exclusively for them, and the hoagies are made to order without frozen ingredients. These are all wonderful. The fries shouldn't be even called fries in a strict sense; they're prepared in the same manner as French or Belgian frites. Due to double frying, the outsides are potato chip crispy, the insides are sublimely creamy, and they're deftly salted. The fact that they're served in absurd portions adds to the experience, as do the lowbrow but delicious options of processed cheese or beef gravy as dips. The hot dogs are natural casing and thus have an unparalleled snap. They lack the mushiness commonly found with lower quality dogs and so eat more like a piece of meat, with excellent spicing to boot. Factor in free chili (among other toppings) and a piece of freshly steamed cheese for $0. 50 and you have drunk food bliss or sober great eats. Although I've never tried the subs, I've heard nothing but great things. . The rest of the menu is, unfortunately, mostly pre-frozen including the 21 shrimp (which I admit to gorging on while inebriated), chicken parm sandwich, and fish dinners. Not worth the dough you have to shell out. Why you would order pizza here with $5 Sorrento's or $8 Romano within walking distance is beyond me. The beer selection is puzzlingly excellent.","Fantastic experience . . . I couldn't have asked for a better meal for lunch.  . Antipasta salad, couple meatballs and a slice of pizza from my buddy. Perfect !!. Couldn't be more happy","We came here because it was convenient, having just walked out of Settebello a few doors away. Because we had already had drinks and a taste of the awful pizza there, we weren't all that hungry, so we decided to stick with shawarma sandwiches - lamb for me, chicken for Mr. Cluck, 9. 95 each. Even so, we were served a basket of warm, puffy pita with some olive oil/balsamic for dipping. . Our server was Simi, a delightful young woman from Israel, who couldn't have been nicer, and didn't betray any annoyance that we were ordering so little.    . I loved that we were able to substitute salad, rice or broccoli at no extra charge, and we both went with salad. It was a large portion, but simple - just romaine, tomato, cucumber and some seasoning, accompanied by a lemony vinaigrette. . The sandwiches were excellent, and we were given cups of extra tahini to put on them. The pita had that extra bit of crispness around the edges that makes a sandwich great, and we both enjoyed our meals. . Khoury's is a large place, with cloth napkins and tablecloths covered with paper. Only the lighting - too much, in my opinion - prevents me from thinking of this as an upscale place. A little dimness would add megawatts to the atmosphere. . When one door closes, another opens. In this case, you can take that literally.","One of my favorite things I've ever heard Guy Fieri say is \"If you're from Pittsburgh, you've heard of 'The Run'\". Guy, I had not heard of the run, and I have yet to meet anyone that, prior to going to Big Jim's, has heard of The Run either(Except for my one friend's grandma). However, I'll not forget The Run - a small stretch in Greenfield near the South Side Works involving a baseball field that has housed this place since 1977 - after having come to Big Jim's. . Big Jim's is full of cheap, largely-portioned food that I think is characteristic of this area. Little flair, decent flavor, no funny business. Enter and take your pick of the dining room or the bar area. There may be a wait(I've been here once or twice with a line out the door, mostly during games. Go another time and you're good to sit just about anywhere). The crowd is a good mix - neighbors, locals, Pitt students. The menu is a selection of mostly fried appetizers, sandwiches, hoagies, some Italian specialties, and pizza. . My favorite item to get here is definitely the veggie hoagie. So simple: Good bread, provalone cheese, brocolli, cauliflower, onions, peppers, carrots, thrown in the oven until the veggies are roasted(Add mayo for me, of course. . . And sometimes a little ketchup :). This thing tastes amazing, and while I could probably down a full one, I prefer to share it with a side of some kind of appetizer. The spaghetti here is also pretty good, and I've had the eggplant parmesian and it was decent. The entrees will net you garlic bread and spaghetti and a salad, large portions of everything, so don't attempt them alone. . Now all that being said, I do have a few gripes about this place - Number one being that the service is slow. My order usually takes about 20-30 minutes to come back to me, which for a hoagie is kind of crazy in my opinion. The staff is friendly and it's hard to get upset, just don't come here for a 'quick' bite. My other gripe is that while some of the menu is definitely home cookin', other parts of the menu are definitely not, so buyer beware. My girlfriend ordered the applesauce once($1. 50) and about 15 minutes later(but well before the rest of our food came) the waitress handed her a generic plastic cup of applesauce, not even opened. I mean come on, at least put the stuff in a dish. . But what are you gonna do. The veggie hoagie is too good to pass up. Just accept the stuff for what it is, and don't try and go on the edge of this place's comfort zone. Stick to what they do best and you won't be disappointed.","I tried Grimaldi's for the first time at least a year ago. I don't even remember if I like the pizza here, so it was a good time to come back and try it again. . Service: 2 Stars. . Ugh. . . . Where do I begin? If you get a server named Jilani, beware!! You may want to ask for someone else. I usually don't name employees who gave bad service in my reviews, but this guy made me angry! We came here on a Sunday afternoon. It was perfect timing because we had just missed the lunch rush and it wasn't as crowded. After the hostess showed us to our table, we waited for 15 minutes until our server finally showed up. What annoyed me was that there was another couple that was sitting right next to us and arrived after we did. Yet, they got serviced by Jilani first. A few minutes later, I overheard the hostess telling him that we came in first and have been waiting for a while. Thank you for actually noticing. He obviously sucks at keeping track of his tables. Finally, he stops by our table. No \"Hello\" or \"Welcome, \" just \"What would you like to order?\" We pretty much didn't see him until paying for our bill. Other servers, who were much more friendly, brought us our drinks and food. 2 starts for them! Jilani did not care to check on us while we were eating, nor did he offer to refill our drinks. After we were done, we waited for another 15 minutes until he finally showed up again and asked \"You want me to box that?\" No, I'm going to spend the rest of the day here staring at my 3 slices of leftover pizza. What do you think?! A few minutes later, he dropped off the pizza and bill without saying a word. I don't even know why I left him a tip. Although it was much less that what I would have left for a good server. . Food: 4 Stars. . Not the best tasting pizza I have eaten, but still pretty good. I don't know if I came here on a off day, but my pepperoni pizza was a bit salty. I do like their crispy thin crust and fresh ingredients. Although once in a while, the cheese would completely fall off the slice. . If you sign up for their VIP newsletter through their website, you will get a coupon for $5 off your next bill. They also give you a free pizza on your birthday. . Hoping for better service the next time around!","Their pizza is always hot &amp; fresh. I placed on online order last week and somehow when I went to pick it up I had 3 pizza's!  I showed the confirmation email &amp; explained I hadn't hit complete button &amp; I went back and edited my order. Jay was kind enough to give me those 3 pizzas for the price of one instead of throwing them away. I thanked him and apologized sincerely. . I will continue to do the business with them . . . . . it's the best pizza in my opinion!","The pizza was absolutely terrible, the sauce bland, the crust was like thick cardboard and the employees were truly terrible to deal with. . Spend your money elsewhere, you'll be glad you did.","I have spent a lot of time researching pizzerias in Montreal. . . reading reviews, going to recommended places. . . . but so far, the pizza here is by far one of the best in Montreal. The atmosphere is very welcoming, staff friendly and efficient- there is a lovely selection of wines, sometimes with incredibly good buys with their private imports. . . All around I love this place and would say truly, one of the best Neapolitan style pizzas in the city. Highly recommend. . Now. . . . if only they had an appetizer of fresh mozzarella. . . . . . . . . .","We choose this place over the many other pizza options in the area and boy that was a mistake. . . . I ordered a calzone to share and it was a large portion but the dough was raw and soggy! I asked if it at ricotta cheese and was told yes, and when I got it home I found out there was none. This was upsetting to me because I would have paid the extra for the ricotta had I just been told correctly. I did order the garlic knots as well and they were okay, a little bland but not the worst I have had. All in all I will not return to this establishment not when  there is so many choices in the area.","Delicious food!  I went there for my birthday. The service was great. I recommend the brick oven pizza!","This place was great when it was called Mark Rich's NY Pizza. The new place has gone way downhill. I used to love their pizza, but now it's way below average. I used to drive miles out of my way to eat here, but no more. It's just not the same. The staff changed and I guess they changed cooks.","My family has been in the pizza business for 45 years. I have eaten pizza from all over the world. I know pizza. Las Vegas is quickly becoming the best pizza city on the planet . Sure some would argue New York, Chicago etc. But, Las Vegas gets the best Pizza places from every city that migrates here and opens up a shop. Bruno's is one of those shops. Here is a classic 1970's pizza place that understands that you need great ingredients to make a great pie. The best dough, a unique flavorful sauce , great cheese and toppings. Everything is top quality. The guy below who gave a 1 Star review doesn't know what he's talking about. First , who would dare talk smack about free pizza brought to their work. But to talk smack about what is easily one of the top pizza places in Las Vegas. He must be a hater for sure. Ignore his review . Trust me and the others on here . This pizza place deserves a visit . The people who live around there should be rejoicing . These are owners who care about their product and customers . I came in with my two kids and they brought us out cinnamon rolls on the house . Bite squad delivers and I'm sure Postmates will too. Pizza lovers you need to come and try this for yourself . . . Helpful advice : . My only advice to them would be to carry more rare and hard to find bottled sodas and root beers. Those would warrant the price you are asking . Or lower it a buck. Just my two cents","Very good pizza!! Test very good and fresh!! I order here a lot and never had bad food. They always make the pizzas very quick. I always order online.","How did I not know about this place sooner? Great pizza and appetizers. I have been looking for a great pizza place in the Avondale area for a long time and I finally found one!","I love this place!  Ben there many times!. The staff is very professional and nice!. Located by the sports bar at M Casino Las Vegas it is a great place to have some awesome food and or sandwiches for which I have eaten there many times. . Their pizza is very tasty as you can taste each individual ingredient in every delicious bit. You always leave full of food and calories!  Ok, Hit The Gym After! LOL. A great place to eat by yourself or even take a casual date!. You got to go, and be careful, don't spend all your money on the slots or at the tables. LOL . Note:  There is no such thing as a HOT slot machine, only the seat you sit in.  . Have fun, its a must go!","Gotham pizza is the best pizza I have ever had. Fresh tomato sauce, cheese, meat. . . everything is so fresh. Delicious!","I'm not really a big fan of the \"new\" Dominos pizza. I think this is a case of old Coke and new Coke. Remember back in the day, Coke changed it's formula to be more syrupy tasting, similar to Pepsi? Then they decided it was a big mistake and went back to \"Coke Classic. \" I think same thing here applies. I had Dominos \"new\" taste today and didn't really care for the change. Behind Peter Piper Pizza, Dominos has been my 2nd favorite of the pizza chains. I liked the old taste, and I think they should bring it back. They can call it \"Dominos Classic. \". I'm not saying I don't like the new pizza, I kind of like that strong garlic flavor to the crust. But I liked the taste of the old crust better. I never thought the old pizza tasted like \"cardboard\" like I've heard some people complain about. I think Dominos may have overreacted here to slumping sales.","Not a bad place!. It's pretty cheap so that's why I'm sticking with 3 stars. The food isn't that good but it's pretty cheap and fills you up. . Their salad is pretty darn good. . Pizza is not very good which is weird for a pizza place. . I usually eat 2 slices and stick with the other stuff. . I love the pasta and soup. . I always get the pasta and cover it with Alfredo and marinara sauce. But I HAVE to eat it with the dry chili pepper they provide (thank goodness) if they didn't have that then I would never come here. It makes it taste SO much better. . As for the soup I also HAVE to add pepper and chili pepper or I wouldn't be able to eat it. But when I do add those things the soup and pasta are SO good. . I think their desserts are WAY too sweet but I still like coming. . You can order toe own pizza which is awesome.","I stayed at the Aria for a work conference, and decided to get a pizza and salad for lunch. The pizza bar is located at the bottom of the escalators next to the burger place. Get there early because if there's a conference or if it's busy, you will wait! Luckily I was able to order early before the crowds. I ordered to-go and decided to take my food back to my room. . I ordered the arugula salad and a slice of pizza. This meal was about $15 (yup everything in LV is expensive!). The salad was good enough to share for 2 people, but I felt the salad was really dry. I should have asked for extra dressing. The dressing was already mixed in, but I barely tasted it. What I liked about the salad was that it was fresh and not much filler. I wish there was more cheese and croutons or something crunchy other than the radish tasting veggie that topped the salad. . For my pizza, I ordered the meat lovers. The slice was eh. Nothing special. I wish there was more sauce on the pizza. The slice was small and wasn't filling. Wish I was able to get this pizza fresh and out of the oven!","I didn't want to eat nachos and hotdogs with nasty (but probably tasty) artificial cheese before the Jay's game so I opted for Pizza Rustica. Their small pizza sans-outer crust was the perfect size for me. I got the chicken, spinach with cream sauce. It had a bit of sun-dried tomatoes and although I'm not a huge sun-dried tomato fan I thought that a little bit of it added a nice touch. The thin crust was just perfect and had a slight hint of a smokey oven flavour. I was a little disappointed that they ran out of duck and were not making their soup of the day, the two things that I originally wanted to order. . Their patio was beautiful, albeit noisy on this perfectly sunny day. It was a true Toronto experience with loud trucks honking and traffic right beside the patio.","We had a very nice unplanned lunch at Anthony's today. In my system 3 stars is the maximum score for a casual pizza place, since it's a very low level of difficulty establishment. That said, we were happy with our shared salad and meatball sandwich. The sandwich was made from a pizza crust, with sliced meatballs and a very spicy pepper - nice! It's an open, clean, loud dining room. The menu is limited to pizza and a couple of salads and sandwiches. There's also a surprisingly diversified by-the-glass wine list. Service was prompt and professional. Anthony's is definitely on our lunch list.","One of the best chicken wings and pizza in Arcadia area for affordable price. Convenient from where I live and employees are friendly every time I go.","Live right by Danny Boys and we finally decided to try it. Honestly, the last year I've lived here I thought it was a cabaret of some sort. Not a very attractive looking restaurant from the outside. The interior of the restaurant was such a pleasant surprise. Very clean and had a great welcoming feel. . Unfortunately, the service was slow and the food was nothing great. I ordered a melt and it was oily and nothing to brag about. The pizza we ordered was also subpar. I wanted to ask for a side of sauce because it lacked flavor. I will say the flies were yummy, but I mean that's a given. . On a last note, the menu is outrageously large. Too many items in my opinion. Made it hard to decide and I feel like much if it was just over kill. Overall, wasn't too impressed with the service or food, but I would come back for the bar, it had a cool, relaxed atmosphere.","Was here for a large group dinner on a Friday evening. Would definitely suggest reservations as this place is hopping - we were seated right away and had a server who was on top of her game. I had some pinot grigio to accompany my meal. I started with a roasted date (heavier on the stuffing than on the date, but good) and the roasted nuts (really delicious and strong flavor. . . good mixture of choices). I then had the pizza with pepperoni on top. It was a good upscale bar pizza - filling with a decent flavor balance. I liked the vibe at this place - trendy, yet comfortable. Definitely a place I would \"hang\" if I lived in the area.","This place is probably 3. 5 stars, but as Yelp doesn't allow that I rounded down to 3. . I had a slice of their mushroom pizza - which costs $5. 50 hence the name of the place. It was decent, slightly salty and plenty of mushrooms. The crust was a bit chewy and thicker than I like. . The price was reasonable for the quality of food, but really if you want the best slice in Vegas then you have to find the \"secret\" pizza place in Cosmopolitan and have a slice of the white pizza - amazing!","What great service! We came in on rather sad circumstances and were looking for pizza for a gathering following a service. We received totally awesome service! The manager was very helpful and got us set with a whole stack of pizzas in a pretty amazing amount of time. . We were able to place our order and grab a seat for a little while, drink a few beers and take the order over to the wake. It was very nice that we were able to receive the customer service we received because it made what was already a tough day much easier. . I was definitely surprise and satisfied with our experience and will consider Barro's Pizza for family dinner night as well as possible events moving forward.","We love this pizza. Went there today and ordered a Soho salad pizza. It was ordered with no tomatoes or almonds. It was brought out with almonds and tomatoes by a gentleman we later learned was the manager. We expressed to him that we had asked for no almonds or tomatoes and apologized and took it back. The Soho comes back with our waitress with tomatoes. We again expressed to her that we did not want tomatoes and she says she will get the manager and leaves it on the table. Several minutes go by and the manager came out and apologized and said he had a large catering order on the phone and neglected to tell the kitchen no tomatoes. He took it back and a short time it came out for the third time correctly. Considering all the issues one would have expected the Soho to be comp'd. When we got the bill it was still on there. We paid the bill and expressed to the waitress that it was disappointing that we were still charged for the Soho when it took 3 times to get it correct. She told us that she thought the manager would have taken it off but he didn't and she apologized. The whole point of having dinner together is to eat together. Because of the issues this didn't happen as my pizza would have been cold.  . Bummer experience all around.  . Returned today for take out. Pizza was good and made just like we ordered. We are very satisfied with this visit and the excellent food!!!","Great pizza. Great service. . 10/10 would get again. Pizza by the slice or small to giant!. Appetizers, gyros, cold drinks.","Definitely a great find inside the Venetian/Palazzo resorts. . At times it might seem impossible to just grab a quick, light, and fairly inexpensive meal inside these casino resorts. But, inside the food court there are a couple options outside of the normal pizza, burgers and chinese. . Towers Deli is clean, spacious and inviting. There are plenty of options and each sandwich is made to order, so everyone should be able to get something they like. The prices are good, but when you compare to the other options you have I'd say they are pretty great for what you're getting. The sandwiches are HUGE and delicious. I almost regret getting a bag of chips as well. . Next time we're at the Palazzo, we'll definitely stop by the Towers Deli for lunch again.","This place is not the cleanest, but I can't resist their food especially their fries with cheese and white pizza! As expected, everything is a bit on the greasy side, but that's just how we like it! They have a great selection of beer as well.","Aladdin's is one of my favorite restaurants and a great fallback when there's no where else I want to go. Don't let the Lebanese/Middle Eastern/Mediterranean label scare you- Aladdin's has something for everyone. . First off, everything at Aladdin's is fresh and delicious. I've never had anything there that wasn't made well or seemed to come from a box. The lettuce is always crispy, the meats fresh and juicy, and I love their pita. Plus, with so many vegetarian dishes on the menu, I doubt there will be too many people that can find a fault with Aladdin's. . My favorite thing to get on the menu is the Flavor Savor Plate. It has a bunch of the best from Aladdin's, with Chicken Mishwi, Beef Kafta, rice, salad, hummos, and Falaffel (mmm. . . Falaffel). They also have a dozen other plates with all kinds of chicken, lamb, beef, and other combinations that will make your head spin, but if you have no idea what to order, get the Flavor Savor and you'll get a little bit of the best on the menu- plus at $9. 95, you can't beat the price and will probably have leftovers. . Aladdin's also has these amazing stuffed pitas. They take fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and onions, and overstuff them into a pita pocket. Then, they put a meat on it, a choice of feta or cheddar cheese, and dressing. These things are huge, and my favorite is the tuna pocket. The tuna is big chunks of tuna steak that is cubed and grilled with seasonings- yum. . I've also tried several of their pita pizzas, which have a crispy pita base and lots of choices on toppings. There also wraps, rolls, cheese pies, stuffed grape leaves, and lots more- the menu will make your head spin. For an appetizer, you can't go wrong with their hummos. . Finally, make sure you leave room for dessert. Despite their Middle Eastern menu, they have very Americanized desserts that are freaking awesome. You can't miss them when you walk in- they're in a case at the front entrance. These monster cakes are incredible, and could have anything from double chocolate cake, to red velvet cake, carrot cake, or lots of others. The cakes are huge, and the portions are giant. Many times, I come here just for dessert. They also usually have two or three different kinds of baklava, which are moist and sweet and better then my grandmother's (sorry Nene). . Are you still reading?? Why haven't you headed over to Aladdin's yet? Don't worry, the place is casual, so you don't even have to dress up, and you'll want to bring a friend because the portions are big and you'll want to share. Enjoy!","I saw this place online and figured must try when I go visit Montreal. Friday night was pretty busy, however we were quickly seated and served. The waiter was kind though out the entire time. Excellent service. The food was delicious, enjoyed they pizza with this spicy sauce they give you on the side, a must have. Definitely recommend!","When I went to school at U of I, I came here all the time during lunch to grab a roast beef or ham sandwich on their freshly baked swiss bread. Sometimes I went for the half soup/half sandwich, or half salad/half sandwich to get more variety in my diet. The food here is like comfort food for me, since I grew up in Urbana and my mother used to buy these sandwiches and their large loaves of freshly baked Z\u00fcpfe for my brothers and me. . The service at The Bread Company has always been fast and efficient, and the employees were always very cool and made no mistakes taking my order and making me a really good sandwich. . I've been here a few times for dinner with my friends. The atmosphere totally changes in the evening for dinner, as they lay out white tablecloths, dim the lights and allow the romantic glow of candles set the mood. Their pizza is delicious and filling, and their tapas come in pretty big portions. This is a cute and cozy place for anyone on a date or double date, or out to celebrate a special occasion. . I've ordered take out from them a few times when I've had last minute dinner party pot lucks to attend and didn't have time to cook. One time, I picked up a strawberry walnut mixed green salad, which was perfect, and also a french baguette with a side of baked garlic bulbs drizzled with olive oil. It was worth every dollar. . I love this place!","What a disappointment!  I was all excited to sit on outside on their beautiful rooftop patio to enjoy the redonkulous summer heat with a beer and some pizza and I left there utterly disappointed to how bad the food was. . To start, the bruschetta was served to us on soggy whole what bread, not toasted, not buttered - nada. It tasted like a wet sponge which could have been salvaged had they prepped the toppings properly, but no, it was a pile of diced tomatoes with zero garlic or onion flavour - not even salt!  The cheese they put on top was also sad and tasteless. C'mon now! I thought we were in Little Italy?!  Where's the damn pride?!. We ordered two pizzas, the Alla Marco and the Salmon. The salmon was definitely better than the Marco, but neither were very flavourful. The goat cheese on the Marco was sparse, the chicken rubbery and it just felt like flat bread with things dumped on top. . While the waitress was very friendly, she was incredibly slow and double charged us for a couple things on our bill. . I was holding out going here 'cuz I thought it was worthy of a meaningful meal, but I'm glad I did just a pop in, 'cuz there's no way I'm going back.","First off. . it's Little Ceasar's. So. . . think whatever you will. . . but I don't think their pizza is all that bad. It's hard to beat for a $5 also. Quick dinner for 2. This particular location, never had any problems. In and out of the drive-thru, usually the same guy is there when I go through. . . . they're quick to get you in and out. No complaints.","There's nothing to say. It's Chicago Style pizza in Phoenix. I have died and gone to pizza heaven!","Soooo. . . I honestly had no expectations for this place. . . It's in heavily Chinese-centric strip mall where lee lee market is located. There is a tattoo parlor right next door should you decide to commemorate your GOGI experience. Such and eclectic mix of businesses. . . . Anyhow. I walked in on a wed lunch break and waited awkwardly at the front to be seated for a couple minutes. Once I got seated, things moved fairly fast. I couldn't decide between the bibimbap or the hot soondooboo, so I determined I'd get the combo which had both. Win win. Yay. . I liked their banchan and I loved loved loved their bibimbap. I got the mixed soondooboo spicy, where I found the meat in the soup to be actually very delightful whereas some places give you the trash meat in the soup. Kudos. Job well done GOGI. . Now. On to the stone dol-sot-bibimbap. WOWZER. The thing was bigger than my head. It was the size of a med pizza, which I ate without guilt. Funny isn't it? I would feel so horrid if I ate the same amount in pizza but felt weirdly satisfied when I ate the equivalent in a bibimbap? It is something you MUST try. I loved it and crushed it. I challenge you ;)","My parents order from this pizzaria . I was visiting and they said they would pick up a pizza in advance to eat later that night. (SHRIEK) I hardly ever like pizza reheated. It just isn't the same as fresh. This is the exception to that rule. I love pizza. I have traveled enough and have eaten many different styles of pizza and I think Joe's is right up there. Light crust not floppy, (especially on a reheat)  sauce not too sweet, sausage crumbled just right. Cheese just right. . . . . Hey Joe-  I am Jim and Margie's kid","There pizza was amazing!  We're new to the area and ordered delivery. We got a thin crust topped with red peppers, green peppers, banana peppers, and pepperoni. Amazing!  We'll definitely be ordering from there again!","Thanks to Yelp we decided to give this place a try. The pizza is good. It is our new place for pizza. We have tried the Hawaiian and the supreme. Both were good. . We like to try different pizza places. The family still agrees they like this one the best. The crust is a little thinner and a little more  cheese to sauce. It is on top of our rotation.","One star for now. Wanted pizza by the slice, as advertised on their website, menu, and neon sign. Don't sell it on weekends.","Rocco's NY Pizzeria is the only place we get pizza. Their service has been wonderful every time, and our order is never late. I love the natural ingredients, and the slices are big! Also, the family favorite of ours from Rocco's is their Buffalo Wings! They are crispy and have the perfect amount of sauce! YUM! Love having a local pizza shop so close to home! Thanks Rocco's!","CPK has great service! It was my first time at the restaurant and they gave me a free dessert that was amazing! i recommended coming in and trying the thai pizza and salted caramel pudding!","Took a while to get the pizza, they don't have breadsticks, the pizza was over cooked just a little bit, the service was pretty good as the employees were nice, way over priced for what you get!  4 sodas, a 12 inch cheese pizza, a 12 inch pizza with pepperoni on one half and a few meats on the other half and 1 cannoli was $48 without tip.","We love the Stone and Vine in Chandler. The music and atmosphere is really nice. Great food and wine choices too. My husband loves the Chicken Parmesan and pizza. I usually get the carnitas tacos which is listed as an appetizer but is more than enough for a meal. The servings are very generous and can easily be shared or saved for later.","Why is it that every time I go during buffet hours 11-2 they have the best service and soft pizza ? But when I go during other hours the service is not so good, they took a few minutes for the employee to take our order when we were the only ones in line. Nonetheless we ordered wings which were yummy but when we got the pizza it was hard and burnt around the crust, cmon the employee knows what they are serving to us the costumers why are u serving us hard burnt pizza ? This happend not once but twice in different occasions. I will just stick to going during buffet hours. . . . . I love going to this location but they should at least acknowledge  to serve us softer pizza. Like seriously I know they would not enjoy eating hard burnt pizza!","Disappointed. Was there a week ago. Playing is still fun. Missed Bugsy's Cabaret, but would recommend for a burleque show. Went for Bonano's pizza. Looooove their pizza. To die for. I was disappointed though. It didn't smell super coco-nutty like ush. Lame. That's half the experience for me. Seriously, fix it! Scent is the strongest element ties to memory. Soooooo. . . . Please. Bring back the \"Coco\"","This location is the reason I now frequent Grimaldi's Pizzeria when I'm around one. A customer was dining on a take-out pizza in the food court. It looked so much better than anything available in the food court. I asked where it was from, tried Grimaldi's for myself, and have been going back ever since. Be sure to join their e-club for special offers.","The elevators barely work, the bartenders are unable to make any mixed drink (they straight up told me they cant), all of the coupons give  to you when u check in are under stipulations (that is not listed on the fine print but told to you when you present it, the pizza socks, the water pump sounds like dolphins screaming, I was not provided with a wash cloths or decent pillows. The pillows were completely flat. And, it's a good thing I have short thin hair because the shampoo/conditioner combo is ridiculously small. The only good thing about this hotel is the coffee shop ladies at the front entrance and the mcdonalds in the hotel. NEVER AGAIN. Only reason I stayed here is because I \"won a trip\" and that's where they put me.","Our daughter recommended State 48 because it is a favorite of theirs both for the food and the selection of beers. All four of us went on Friday for happy hour and stayed later. I don't drink, but was assured by the other three that the beers were great. Two of us ordered happy hour appetizers as meals and my husband had the Ruben which he said was delicious!  My \"appetizer\" was the chicken and lettuce cups and it was delicious as well!   Sunday night is typically our pizza night so we decided to go there, just the two of us, and try their wood-fired pizza. Nikki recommended \"The Boss\" and it was fantastic!  The crust is home made with beer and is thin, but not like a cracker crust---and I am not usually a crust eater!  The menu says that they make their mozzarella fresh daily as well, and it shows!  The seasonings were perfection. Quite possibly the best pizza I have ever had!   So glad we found this gem!  We will be back frequently!","Ordered pick up from here and the wings were amazing!! They didn't have a whole lot of sauce on them which made me skeptical at first but once I ate them they were so delicious. We also got a pizza which was great as well. It was ready in 15 minutes. I would definitely order from here again!","PROS: 90-seconds-fast, cheap, delicious pizza. CONS: ?. I had a custom Margherita pizza with mushrooms, and it came piping hot, crisp, and oh-so-delicious! You order at the counter and you get your pizza shortly after! The people who work at Novanta were exceptionally nice! We were in and out of the restaurant in less than 30 minutes. Five stars for a prime example of WYSIWYG!","Bottega serves quality food from top to bottom and always offers new and delicious appetizers which, so far, have never disappointed me or my guests. I have been there 6 different times now and have never walked out thinking the meal I just had was nothing but, at the minimum, a solid experience. It's a well-run restaurant. . I always order the Caprese pizza because I cannot resist the combination of ingredients. It tastes great and as everyone else says the crust is amazing but I do feel like sometimes the middle part of the pizza becomes soggy and a bit mushy. This might often be the case when using cherry tomatoes and I am not sure if there's a way around it? . The prices are a bit high but what you get in return is a level of freshness rarely found in other restaurants in the city so at least, you know the prices are not totally unfair. They do not skimp on quality. Besides, it's hard to argue their prices are too high since the place is almost always jam packed for dinners, especially late in the week. . Service has always been very good despite how busy they are. The waiters are friendly, knowledgeable and professional. . Good eats await you at Bottega and for me has yet to ever disappoint. . Vegetarian food: 4. 0. Value: 4. 0 (it's expensive but the quality of ingredients is A+). Service: 4. 5","Over saturated pizza had to be consumed with a knife and fork. Limp and overloaded. . . Absolutely impossible to handle, a sure sign the crust and proportion of toppings was all wrong. At $10 a slice it needs to be perfect. Just like the over-engineered Aria hotel where it is located, everything is massive overkill. Sometimes less is more.","Used to like Barro's but this location has turned me off. The pizza is just okay, service has been consistently bad, and good luck finding a napkin or condiment.","We've been back to Vegas a few more times since my last review and have tried our place each time of course. Unfortunately, things seem to go down a little bit more each time. I didn't want to believe it at first thinking they were just having a day off, but after three subsequent not so great visits, I really have to knock down the stars from the 5 to a 3. 5. The bread used to be served hot; but now they're cold, hard even. The last two pizzas we ordered had way burnt crusts, and adding meatballs to a dish was way way overpriced - 4 bucks EACH meatball!!!  This used to be destination eating, but now it's an \"oh if we're in the area and want italian\" place for us.","After a long day, and running around, my go to meal is always Pizza. For a quick slice I made my way over. I only wanted a piece to go. They had four pizzas to choose from. They each looked great. I went with the meat lovers pizza, see the picture. The pizzas appear to be from a fire oven. I feel that adds a little extra taste, as long as it is not burned. Also, they were not just out of the oven, so they had time to set. This was truly a great pizza. 9. 5/10. While I ordered the pizza to go, they have a few standing tables to eat your slice. Also, just around the corner is a cafe you can sit down to eat. . Ciao","Really good experience. Novanta we learned means 90, meaning further that their pizza is cooked 90 seconds at 900 degrees. . Simple is always good and this is simple and good. . We are Rookies at Neapolitan pizza - stupidly added toppings to a Margherita pizza. Don't do that. . Mozzarella bar was a great addition to the meal for only 9 bucks. . Good size personal pizza - can feed two when you spilt a Mozzarella bar.","A 3-star for sure. . For what this place is (a Cheapy Chinee Buffet) it fits the bill. Nothing served here is all that impressive, but at least for the most part the place is clean. The pricing doesn't impress me that much either, there are other Chinee buffets around town for the same price or cheaper that have the same type of food at the same quality. I swear, you go here do not expect Cathay House type food!  Totally different!. All the usual suspects are here at this Krazy Buffet:. Fried Rice, Chow Mein, Beef &amp; Broccoli, Sweet &amp; Sour Pork, Orange Chicken (which by the way Panda Express does it better haha), Egg Rolls, Egg Fu Young, Mongolian Beef, various types of faux-shi (fake 'California' roll type sushi), Won Ton soup, and Hot &amp; Sour soup. Quite a number of dishes. You also have the option of a Mongolian Bar included in the price where you can pick your veggies and raw meat from the serving line and have the chef du jour (in my case a young Mexican kid named Pablito. . or was it Jose?) cook them for you in a teppanyaki manner.  . For the American crowd there is the added Fried Chicken Wings (the MSG added on the ones at Buffet @ Asia make them sooooo much tastier), French Fries and pizza for the kids too. What is it about pizza at a Chinee buffet that makes it somehow good? Must be the cheese? Or is some secret MSG sprinkled on top for good measure? Hmmm. . . . . There's a decent looking salad bar but the dessert bar is a little lacking. Come on, I love me some mini chocolate and powdered donuts. . . but how Chinee is that? And of course there is the chocolate and vanilla soft serve machine.  . Food is ok, tasty if you're hungry and on a dime budget. It will fill you up but somehow leave you feeling empty. Then 2 hours later you are hungry again!  I'm an Asian boy (yes, part Chinee) so I'm not trying to be racist. This is no joke for me. Seriously. I ate my fill here, left feeling a lil' bit queezy. Then a few hours later I'm hungry again!  . Of course dinner may be better but I don't know. I'm way too cheap of a Chinee at the moment to pay $12 per person for dinner. I feel that the options for me are better for dinner at another buffet of the same type, although I will not mention names. But I think I might have already earlier in my review. My bad!  . Krazy Buffet is a good option for those of you on a tiny budget, but don't have a weak stomach!  Don't go here if you've got a sensitive tummy. I know the place touts that they don't use MSG but man is some of their food a bit on the salty side!  So be sure to get an extra glass of water in to wash it down. And perhaps a fortune cookie too.","For some reason I thought I had already reviewed this place and after my recent experience I needed to update my review. Well, it turns out I did not actually review it the first time. I've decided to use phrases that I heard constantly on my report cards as I was growing up. . My original visit was not so great. The service was really blah and despite us ordering a shit ton of alcohol (I know, I know, a common theme in my reviews, I swear I don't have a problem), the server was not at all attentive. Overall, I could sum up my original experience as a report card: Fails to reach it's full potential. . Cue up my most recent visit which took place at 4. 15pm on a Thursday under the advice of my friend who said I would LOVE the deals.  (I really really like a deal!)  . Pizza - $5. Wine - $5. The pizza was freakin' amazing and the WINE WAS $5!  Report card review: Solid improvement.  . Now, I have a problem. The pizza was so amazing that I can't stop thinking about it. I almost stopped there today by myself and paid full price to drink wine and eat pizza on my own. Report card review on my obvious pizza/wine issues: Heather tends to focus on one thing to the exclusion of getting her work done.  . Bottom line - Give them a try during Happy Hour (M-F, 3-5pm) where pizzas are $5 and WINE IS $5. If you like it, perhaps I'll see you there soon as we both order pizza and wine by ourselves.","Love the idea and the execution of it at Vapiano's. The concept fits well especially when dining in a larger group where everyone is on there own agenda. . which is pretty much always!  It is a classy/casual atmosphere, slightly upscale feel. . Great selection of nice-size personal pizza's and salad's. I typically get the Insulata Mista and add chicken or steak on it and avocado, drives the price up a few bucks. Worth it for a grown @ss man, makes for a healthy great meal. Recently they shorted me big time on the amount of steak, however the cook made up for it. She knew what she did. . Great place in Uptown for casual food, good variety.","Great pizza! Loved the parmigiana (buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, arugula, and prosciutto di parma)","Crazy Jim's is one of those old-standby places. The service is typically always stellar and the foods you enjoy are always of the same quality. I don't go too often, but when I do, I'm always happy I did. . I've only had a couple things on the menu: the teropita appetizer, the steak pita, the jalape\u00f1o burger, and the pepperoni pizza. You can't go wrong with the teropita. The soft, chewy dough is filled with a delicious egg and cheese mixture and is to die for. I highly recommended you start you meal with this. The steak pita is wonderful and what I always order - tender beef, grilled peppers, mozzarella, and grilled onions (which I always omit) on a wonderfully soft and delicious pita. With it, I order a side of fried. Do yourself a favor and order the fries extra crispy. You won't be sorry!  The jalape\u00f1o burger is actually really great. I don't know where they get their jalape\u00f1os, but they are always wonderfully spicy, sometimes EXTREMELY spicy, and always super fresh. My only disappointing meal here has been the pizza. I ordered it on a whim one day and was VERY disappointed. I'm guessing it was an off day, as I've heard others rave about the pizza. It didn't help that I found a hair on my first slice. The waitress was very apologetic. Not only did she comp my meal and offer to have something else made (I'd lost my appetite by then) but she also offered to give me a free meal on a future visit. I declined the free meal, as I didn't feel it was necessary and knew I'd  be back again, but that went a long way. . This place is pretty small and gets busy during lunch and dinner time, so plan to go early or late. Enjoy!","I'm always happy at Wolfman Pizza. We go to the one on Providence Road. Their hand-tossed pizzas are delicious &amp; not too thick (as I like thin-crust better anyway). Their chicken wings are the best I've found and not smothered in batter. Their wolfbites are just little pizzas, so don't get them if you're ordering pizza, but they would be great mini-pizzas for kids. I wish they made them with a bit more of the toppings/fillings. It's a great place to go and watch sports without being overwhelmed with people &amp; you lose the dining aspect of it. I feel this is a neighborhood gem.","You don't expect to find a good restaurant in a strip mall, next to Costco, but Upper Crust is all of that. They have fantastic food, including fresh made mozzarella (made at the restaurant), really good chicken wings (ask for them crispy!), and, yes, great pizza. There's always a happy hour special going on and the bar and restaurant sides are totally separate, which is great for both families and the no-kid crowd. And, now, that it's cooling off, you can finally enjoy the patio!","Stopped here with my wife due to the 18\" pizza for $9 sign out front, it didn't disappoint. The staff is amazingly friendly, upon placing our order they asked what type of sauce we wanted, she said oh you haven't been here before? Said hold on, went to the back and brought out 2 cups with each sauce in them and a roll cut up to try the sauce. Customer service alone this place is remarkable! Then the pizza came out, wow it was huge! Crispy and wonderful. We also got a hoagie, their bread is amazing and it was cooked perfectly. This will be my new go to pizza spot in the Plum area. Do yourself a favor and check it out, also try the sweet sauce!","Disgusting, they brought my sandwich to our table and it was nasty looking and not appealing at all. It was obvious I did not touch the thing. Two different people came to the table asking if I wanted anything different. All I wanted was it removed from in front of me because it was making me noxious. I asked for the check and paid it and left tip. I could not believe they charged me for that item. That is what I get for being nice saying it was not appealing for me rather than being honest that it looked disgusting. Oh well, they will not be able to try again with me because I will not be going back and will not have anything nice to say about this place. Other than my three colleagues seemed to like their pizza.","The pizza is the best I have found in Ohio so far. It's the closest thing we can find to NJ style pie. The chicken parm is wonderful. The portions are huge. The service can be iffy but the food more than makes up for it!","Love this little Italian wine &amp; snack bar. I've walked by Corvo unassumingly many times, but finally had a chance to stop by. The $$$$ reflection for pricing on Yelp seems a little off, because I found their pricing to be more than reasonable for the area (maybe $$-$$$). They also have a wine special on Wednesdays for only $8 a glass. We had the wild boar sliders and the salami pizza. The sliders were outstanding. I really liked the patio and the ambiance inside. Great new addition to the neighbourhood. I'll be back to try out some more things from the eclectic menu.","My favorite part of the meal was the broccoli which was as light as air. . . because our server forgot to bring it over. . I am a huge fan of Bar Buca but found this place really off putting. Both of our servers were just. . . crappy. Our main server seemed to have a language barrier and took wine glasses away when we told her we werent finished, plates away when we were still eating. The guy who brought our wine was serving it old som style and boasted \"its the only way its to be done\" but didnt even do it properly? It was such a confusing experience. . This isnt the restaurants fault but my table of three other 20 somethings kept getting death glares from the middle aged people in the room. Whats that about?. Our pizzas were waiting for a while at the pass and were on the colder side when they came to the table. Nobody in the kitchen looked like they were having any fun :(","I've had lunch here a number of times and dinner twice. All times were above adequate.  . Sadly the parking on a Tuesday afternoon was rather challenging. It took me twenty minutes at the machine. Three cars ahead of me. I should've known, piling on took ten minutes. Luckily the attendant was on hand and she was helpful. Bonus, she remembered assisting me when I came in. The bar wouldn't go up and she even had issues with it releasing up so I could proceed into the garage. Yes, my plate was correctly on the parking meter ticket. Leaving it told me invalid ticket. That was after waiting twenty minutes on the line so I could leave. . Now, onto lunch (once I finally left the parking garage situation). . Met some friends yesterday afternoon who were staying at Aria. It was about 12:30 on a Tuesday- not at all busy. Our waitress was far from that. My friend's husband inquired about the soup, and she spoke AT him and then as if he had no idea about soup or food. If personalities were sold, I would purchase one for her. She never returned inquiring if we needed anything additional. When she brought our drinks she basically threw them down. We thought about dessert, espresso what have you. Then we thought about our waitress. Thought it was better in just leaving sooner than later. The pizza wasn't fully cooked, underneath was more on the raw dough end and no brown on the bottom. It had a nice taste, mushrooms and sausage. Who can honestly not have made a pizza correctly. They did- not cooking it fully.","Just eat the pizza and shut up. It's a great pizza. We loved it. Unique, traditional, handmade. Not an artisan pizza. I classic American pizza like you ate with your parents when you were a kid. Awesome. Not very fancy, but honest, and nice people. Be sure to check out the photos of the family in the little room in the back. Bravo Salvatore family.","Very good food and service. Great patio. Had the pizza and veggie burger. Reasonable prices. Only negative is somewhat uncomfortable metal chairs on patio.","So after watching several hours of The Tudors on Netflix today, we decided to get a pizza delivered. . . . We decided to try Sirius after trying it once before at a friends house  - The General Tso's Pizza which wasn't bad - anyway we settled in on \"The Sombrero\"  taco pizza.  . We were told it would be ab out 45 mins, but it took almost an hour 15 before the delivery guy got to the house. The pizza was okay, but wasn't the best that I have ever had. I might give them another shot. . . . we shall see. . . .","Flour &amp; barley was amazing. We walked in with a huge group after our foundations event, and they were able to acclimate us without problem. The pizza was great, the feel was homey. I can't wait to bring everyone back for a wonderful time and fun night again.","This is excellent pizza. You can tell that care is put into making the pizza and they use quality ingredients. The crust is thicker than a standard New York style pizza, but the outside is crispy and the inside is soft and doughy. The sauce had a nice tomato zing to it, which gave it good flavor. There was a lot of cheese on it for a normal order, extra cheese would of been too much. . The pizza is very filling and heavy for its size. They have excellent specials which make the entire meal very affordable. We got two large pizzas, 2 orders of breadsticks, and a 2 liter soda for $22. 00. That price is a steal!. Give this place a try, it is very clean and has a personal feel to it. The owners are very friendly and even thought it is technically a chain from Indiana, it has a hometown feel to it.","This place is really quite good, esp in relation to the bread and cheese wedge bakeries that are a little too common around here. I'm looking at you guys on the corner of Spadina and Harbord. Crimes against pizza, I say! Crimes!. I'm new to the area and I'm big on my NY style pizza as a Northern NJ native. Of the 5 or so places I've tried in this neighborhood just to the west of U of T, this is probably my favorite so far. It's really quite close to an authentic NY pie based on what I understand Toronto standards to be. I thought the garlic oil was an interesting touch, but pizza is already a greasy food - do we need to add more grease on top? How about some garlic powder? Same difference. . I got one more on the list (Amato) to try but this one probably won't go below #2, and def not below #3 in this area. Pizza Gigi is also high on the current list but probably behind this place.","Loooove this pizza. Buffalo chicken pizza is my favorite. I usually do carry out because I live  right down the street and they've never taken more than 20 minutes to have my order ready. Online ordering is easy to use too.","MAUREEN LOVES THE CASINO. . Yes, ^ just happened. Where can you go on your lunch break for a slice of quality pizza or a milkshake? The Casino. Where can you find the best people watching in CLE? The Casino. Where can you gamble on a Wizard of Oz machine, only to blow a $20 down the drain? The Casino. Where can a 30 something go and get carded like they are 21 at 11:30am? The Casino. . The next time you are downtown or in from out of town, you should pass through especially during the holidays. Grab a slice of pizza and join the resident gamblers for a play or two. . ***make sure you become friends with Diamond Club status members - drinks cost less and taste better.","On February 18 about 11:30am I stopped by for a slice of pizza with sausage and canadian bacon toppings. In the middle of the night I woke up vomiting and diarrhea. One slice of pizza  gave me food poisoning.","Pizza's amazing and fresh! It's a small but neat place. They even make their own pita here! I tired their mushroom pizza. It's unbelievable!I love their variety! I'll definitely come back.","First let me say, I'm a hard sell. I'm from Chicago where you can find great food on every block. Since I've moved here (10 years ago) I've been continuously disappointed and left feeling ripped off for over paying for bad food. . I was sceptical when I ordered, but I wanted delivery and didn't want pizza so I gave it a try. . I ordered the Chipotle Provalone Cheese Steak. OMG it was so good. I was stuffed after eating half of it and thank the Lord they had cheese wiz for the fries (hard to find in this state). . The price was very good, especially considering the quality and portion size. Definately found a new regular spot to eat","I was not blown away as I expected to be by their food. I had one of their pizzas which was average. I felt that the waiter was judging my boyfriend and I because we did not order much and treated us like we were inexperienced with high-end restaurants. Did not like this. The dessert was amazing. Noiciolla gelato and tiramisu are some of the best ive tried, overall ok.","This place is amazing. They have really good authentic Italian food. I've always went to a different Italian place that is a little farther but they have went downhill so I decided to give it a try one night with my family. Everything was delicious and everyone loved what they ordered. . They have complimentary garlic knots which are so good! The service is really nice and everyone is super friendly. . I ordered the chicken Marsala and I was not disappointed. It tasted authentic and amazing; there isn't anything bad I can say! We also tried chicken Alfredo, seafood risotto, and a pizza. . They have a lot of pastry's and desserts that I didn't get to try but they looked very good. . Definitely give this place a try and see what you think!","This place is a lot worse than I remember. . . . . I used to come here before they changed everything up. It was the perfect Italian lunch spot - excellent location, solid food, great service. But it seems that Locale Mercatto is now a shell of its former self. . For starters, and as others have mentioned, the entrance is hard to find. . The menu is a lot worse. They no longer do pizzas. They do panini sandwiches but if you ask me, that's practically a write-off when you go to an Italian restaurant. . They used to bring fresh bread to your table, they no longer do this. They even used to offer fresh parmesan with their pastas; you guessed it, they no longer do this either. . I chose to eat the Spaghetti di Mare. It was okay, a little blander than expected. In fact, if you compare the picture of my dish to other reviewers, mine looks much drier and less creamy. . Where it really went downhill was when a couple friends ordered the dish consisting of salmon and rice. It was lukewarm at best, so we asked a server if it was supposed to be hot. She said yes, so we let her know that it wasn't. She offered to have the kitchen remake it, but instead, they seemed to just throw the food in a pan, mushing everything together, breaking down the salmon. Not a big deal since we're not ones to complain, but it seemed unprofessional to get re-served a dish that looked the way it did (see picture). Plus, we really didn't need the added attitude from the other server (2 people were serving us). . Simply put, avoid this place.","Great pizza and wine/beer selection. The fried cheese appetizer is unique and super tasty!","My husband and I wanted to give our kids one last day of fun before school started back up again so we decided to treat them to a day of fun at Gameworks.    . As we walked in we were greeted by an adorable young lady who explained the different options for purchasing game cards for the children to use to play the games. I'm not sure which \"package\" my husband purchased but it was the perfect amount for keeping the kids happy and busy for a few hours!  I don't remember the last time my kids had this much fun. After an hour and a half or so we decided to sit down and grab a bite to eat. The kids each got a cheeseburger and fries and my husband and I shared a couple of flatbread pizzas. We were VERY impressed with the quality of the food we received. Our server, I can't remember her name, was an absolute doll. The food came out quickly and hot. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu items in the future. A manager even stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our visit. . All in all, it was a fantastic experience for my husband and I as well as our kids who have been begging to go back since we left. Thanks Gameworks!","I really like this place. The staff are always friendly and memorable, and the food is great. . The pizzas are thin with a perfectly crispy crust. My husband orders the sausage and adds mushrooms. It's really good. He eats about 2/3 of it and has a nice treat for breakfast the next day. . I really like their \"fancy salad\" with fresh  greens, bleu cheese, real bacon bits and avocado slices. So darn good. . The cheese bread has roasted red peppers, bleu cheese and bacon, topped with mozzarella. Wow, that's good stuff!. It's a cute restaurant in a handy location. Save room for ice cream at Chocolate Shoppe!","I came in on a late Thursday night NIKKI was our waitress. She is amazing. I definitely recommend this brew pub. She recommended the BBQ pizza it was really good. Their BBQ sauce is to die for &amp; a peach ale. The peach ale is light and crisp with a bit of vanilla twist.","Really liked this place! Had the garlic cheese bread which was delicious but adding their marinara made it out of this world. THE BEST sauce I've ever tasted. We then had their pan pizza and I'm not a big \"pan\" fan but again it was THE BEST--of course I believe the sauce made it so. . So, so good!","Experience and food not on par with Brooklyn or Scottsdale. If you're looking for pizza in Las Vegas, this is probably a good spot but just saying that the experience / service and food is better at other Grimaldi locations.","First I have to say, the first time was great, so we went back a second night!! The food items were actually much better than we expected. When I think of Buffet food, I think of food that has been sitting there for awhile that is luke warm. The food here is fresh and some made to order (pasta, sushi, asian soup). I have to say my favorites were the pasta bar and the asian food. They had great items for kids too, like burgers, pizza, mac/cheese, spaghetti, etc. . But, save room for the dessert section of this buffet!!! It is FANTASTIC! Some items that were there were: specialty cupcakes, creme brule, cookies, chocolate covered strawberries, cream puffs, eau claires, ice cream, cotton candy (kids favorite), and pies. . . . . just to name a few!!! . The service was only OK. We had to actually search for our waitress the first night to get a refill on our pops. The plates piled up on our table for most the meal. For what you pay, the service of the wait staff could definitely be much better!. The prices for adults weren't terrible at $23. 95 for supper, but kids who are 10 or older are considered an adult. I personally believe that a 10 year old should not eat as much as an adult or be encouraged to eat that much. Anyways the other kids were $15. 95 for supper(still a bit pricey for kids, in my opinion). If you are staying at TI, make sure to use the 2 for 1 coupon that comes with your room coupons. The prices for breakfast and lunch were a little cheaper. We only ate here at supper time.","What a disappointment. It's not the first time I order from here but it will be the last. I don't know if they changed the owner or chef but the pizza was such a let down. The first time I tried their pizza, their tomato was amazing. There was a certain spice that they used that left you craving another piece. This time was completely different. There was barely any sauce on the pizza and the dough seemed to have been raw. It was chewy and sat on your stomach. It's a huge disappointment especially when you were craving their pizza and finally cave and have one bite and throw it away. A waste of calories.","Bohemian atmosphere and delicious pizza. Loaded of your favorite toppings and family friendly.","CPK not CKY. By The Rue. Went to lunch at the CPK, . At first I thought it was gonna be gay, . My friend convinced me, said \"no way\", . Their chef's think they're Bobby Flay. . Appetizer was avacado egg rolls, . No, I didn't draft Darren Sproles, . They came on a plate, not in bowls, . When I shoot I score goals!. Lunch was a pizza with pear and gorgozola, . It was amazing down to my soul-a, . In Telluride I take the gondola, . Only hippies and health nuts eat granola. . The ice tea was fantastic, . It made my body spastic, . The food doesn't taste like plastic, . Make sure you're wearing elastic. . Temecula!!","I thought that they had more food options, every weekend I have gone and they only have like 5 non-exciting sub sandwiches-  no pizza, no anything. This is pretty much just a liquor store with some groceries. Not a restaurant which I was lead to believe at first.","I have been going to the Nello's in tukee for over 10 years. My favorites are their spinach salad with their house dressing, garlic bread with tomatoes, and European pizza. They have delicious food, personable service (everyone who works there is happy to be there), and very reasonable prices. . Bummed they are closed for Sunday lunch though. :(","If you are a pizza place and you fuck up pizza then something is clearly wrong with you. Five50 thankfully does not. . however I did go for Happy Hour and ordered pizza by the slice. . I highly recommend (if they are still doing it) to show up between 5-5:50PM during their happy hour, get faded and eat pizza. The ultimate sloth life daily regiment.","Great pizza!  Fried mozzarella was like air filled hot pockets. They really need to use more mozzarella. Service mediocre at best. We ordered pepperoni, got cheese?? Waiter didn't understand when we asked about a white pizza? He had no clue so we gave up. We will go back but won't be ordering fried mozzarella until they change the recipe.","Ate there last night and thoroughly enjoyed it. Kids are free on Sundays, which was an added bonus. Didn't try the pizza on this visit - we had pastas, which were flavorful and filling.  . I agree that the dining room is a little small, and the hanging lamps obscure the TV screens. Other than that, nothing bad to say about this restaurant. This place will definitely be one that we frequent.","Used to love the pizza and pasta at this place. Lately the service has been poor and the pasta has been watery. The restaurant is always busy whenever I go, the workers must be in such a rush to make the food that it hasn't been turning out right. Hopefully they get their food back to the quality that it was before. Disappointed for now. . .","One if the worst ran places ever management is lost in what they need to do. It seems like they don't know what they are doing. Took one hour to get two small pizza's. This place is a joke. Do waste your time.","excellent four cheese pizza but the senatore, one of their paninis, was pretty tasteless and dry! . so. go for the pizzas, and stay to see who walks in from the toronto sun building. sunshine!","Great beers particularly In Tent City and Sound of Freedom, good salads and pizzas. Fast service and friendly wait staff. Generous happy hour prices.","Yummy!. Nice staff, good prices, and good food. . The pizzas come out fast, and are enough to feed 2 people (1 person if you're super hungry). I tried both a veggie-based and meat-based. Both were delicious. The crust is thin, but not overly crispy The garlic oil as a base instead of marinara for a veggie pizza was a great choice. If you want spinach, I would put it on top of the sauce and under the cheese . They also have salads, but the pizza is so good that I'm not sure I plan on trying one!","This place was a cute little place near the linq. Pizza was delicious and flavorful but on the small side. Had the mushroom and vegetable pizza and loved both. Also tried the Caesar salad which was delicious but a small dish! Tiny portions","Come here and get pizza  it's by the slice or whole. Great place for a lunch date, or while you're waiting for a massage at the massage school next door","We chose Bites and Brews because of the many good on-line reviews, especially the pizza. While the pizza turned out to be among the best I've had in the 'burgh, the beer list (bottle n tap) had a pretty solid variety. We just made it in for the happy hour prices. The best part was the service, as our server ably provided several suggestions based on our preferences. It's now my favorite place for good pizza and a great beer. I'll definitely need to try to some of the other pizza varieties.  . There seemed to be plenty of on-street parking.","Bogart's is just ALWAYS reliable. They carry all types of food, including my much needed Natural Balance that PetSmart doesn't carry. Their prices on food are very competitive, and they participate in the buy 10, get 1 free programs for many brands. The staff is also really knowledgeable about dog food. When my dog was going through a \"vomiting and pooping every type of food imaginable phase\", they made really good suggestions about which foods would be too rich for her system, which ones are reliable, and which ones are overrated. Hence my discovery of Natural Balance. . Bogart's has a self wash area that they only charge $10 to use. They also have a stamp card for buy 10 washes, get one free. Always a good go-to in between grooming sessions for my lab. They also have a groomer on site, but I have never used their groomer. I'm just too attached to my other groomer!. The doggie bakery is really fun. They have cookies, will make dog birthday cakes, and even pizza slices for dogs!","Yummny. u want a nice experience . . I loved it. Was a random stop in a place I had zero knowledge of. . sometimes those are the best finds. . we had the Montreal pizza. . home made cecser and house salads. Chicken fatchinni and lasgna. . authentic. Salads were so good!!! And my son had a hamburger he ate it so fast. They were so friendly!! We had left overs from large portions. Go and visit","Loved the pizza. Service was great and the atmosphere was enjoyable. Lots to choose from. Love the margarita pizza. They get your food out to you fast so that the pizza is still hot when you go and take a bite. Taking leftovers home is the best part because you, will have some for the next day and who doesnt love pizza cold or hot or even the next day. Fast, easy and really good are a great combination. And when they make their motzeralla from, scratch you know the food is going to be just as good","My coworkers and I order from here pretty regularly, so it's safe to say we've tried most of their menu. . . but their pizza is extremely f*ing delicious! I don't know what it is about the crust, but it's damn good! They have pretty good pizza deals Monday through Thursday","This may be the best pizza I've ever had. And I've lived all over the country and world while in the military for 20 yrs. It's in the ingredients. High quality, unique. The pie is cooked just right. Incredibly flavorful. . I drive all the way from Sun Prairie once a week to get this pizza. Amazing. . Great, friendly service as well.  . P. s. Shocked that this place only has 3. 5 stars on here.","If a Yelp review could be two words, it would be \"underwhelming &amp; disappointing. \"  Black parts on the soggy wilted salad and I would love to see the bag their \"cheese\" comes out of. As a Chicagoan, I will encourage you to seek your Chicago pizza fix elsewhere. The only silver lining is that the gals at the counter we're very attentive and friendly.","A pretty new spot from what I was told by their staff. Great corner location, and somewhat unassuming from the outside - however, entering leads you to a unique tidy \"flagship\" look. . They have a large display case with colourful sushi rolls, bowls, sushi pizzas, and Asian inspired desserts. A super clean preparation area in the front area (they'd already made the food by that time, so perhaps not always pristine). . Neat colour coordinated d\u00e9cor. Welcoming and enthusiastic staff and management, and because they were so nice, I tried a verrine of mango and coconut pudding which was tasty, but quite small and over priced at 4. 99 + taxes. . Hmm, seems the chia coconut and banana pudding is only 3. 99 which is not as bad - so why the extra buck for another flavour - perhaps the mango is more expensive? Still for that size 3. 99 + taxes would be a lot more fairly priced - just sayin'. . Their individual sushi concept goes like this. . . you mix and match to create your own box from 17 standard listed creations (special until end of August for . 99 cents/piece on selected sushi makis). Make into a trio for 3. 99 + taxes. . Better go and grab that deal ASAP, and save . 49 cents/piece on a few pieces at least. . Note: Will have to review again once tried more food. The current rating is based on the rest.","I like this place. The only other place I been to is Pizza Studio in downtown Phoenix. Although I think the pizza is a little smaller, it's also cooked in a different way. Instead of a conveyor belt oven, it's actually a fire oven. Extra crispy though and different texture. . The taste is pretty good and on par with Pizza studio. I think there may be more ingredients here, but I couldn't put as much ingredients on because of the smaller size. What's impressive was that the pizza cooked in 2 minutes as opposed to 5-10 minutes at Pizza Studio. . Well, the prices are about the same so I guess either place would be fine. I think there are more Fired Pie places and only one Pizza Studio in Phoenix area. So like both places, I give them 4 stars for fast delicious unlimited toppings pizza!","Great place - try the Chicago style pizza - bravo!  This place used to be Pipers - so I don't know where the octegenarians are going these days but Danny Boy's was a pleasant surprise. Nice decor (Sinatra/Rat Pack theme), really good food and great prices. Give them a try. It was better deep dish pizza than I've had in a number of places in Chicago.","I will upgrade their thin crust pizza to well above serviceable. Thick crust still isn't my thing. I really like the house salad dressing. . BTW. . . I only go here because my family likes it. I can take or leave.","This was just plain bad. It had a really overly thick crust with a thin layer of cheese and sauce. It tasted like school lunch pizza from high school in the 80's. The sausage also tasted cheap. I wouldn't recommend this place.","We came here on Halloween night after arriving at the Chandler location only to learn that they were unexpectedly closed (there were supposed to be open). Luckily, this Mesa location was only @ 5 miles away, and they were open until 11:30pm that night, so it worked out even better for us. . Admission was only $1 per person on Halloween evening for those in costume, which we all were. We still had to pay regular price for the skate rental ($3. 50), but at $4. 50 per person, it was a great deal. . The skates were ok; the wheels felt a little \"off\" but I was able to work with them. Nice rink and the music selection was good; they played a mixture of current pop hits to throwback R&amp;B and  pop 80s.  . I'm not sure if it was because it was later in the evening or because it was Halloween, but there weren't a lot a kids, which is a major plus in my book.  . The girls enjoyed the snack bar. They ordered pizza, pretzels, cotton candy, churros, and Icees. Prices were decent and not too over-priced. . Also, there was a police officer on-duty and standing outside in the parking lot when we arrived. I still feel new to PHX.  I don't know the areas and neighbors outside of where I live and work, so I don't know if the security was due to the 'hood, or just general practice. Either way, I did feel secure knowing that someone was watching over the cars that late in the evening. . My biggest complaint here is that the employees' friends were on the rink doing some dangerous stunts (flips, handstands, etc while on their skates!), pretty much the whole night. It posed a risk to other skaters, especially the younger kids, and it encouraged younger kids to mimic the behavior. Not to mention, it's a major risk to whomever owns this venue.","* Overpriced, but that is to be expected for their location. . * The water tasted gross. I get that it is tap water. . but everywhere has tap water and it does not taste that way. . * There is only one men's restroom and one women's restroom. That is not enough for the size of this place. . . especially when the food is overpriced, I do not want to wait for a restroom!. * My husband had the CALABRESE pizza. The toppings were sparse. Their was little sauce on the pizza. The crust was dark and had a burnt taste. . * I had the meatballs. They were bland and you could tell they had huge croutons in them. The sauce they were in was thin and greasy. I tried adding my meatballs and sauce to a slice of my husbands pizza and it still didn't taste good!. * I did not like the green sauce they seemed to put on everything. . * The Caesar salad was fresh, but $12. . * The service was good. . They definitely get business because of their location, not because of the food! There are so many better places in Las Vegas!","I will begin by saying this was my worst dining experience in as long as I can remember. Since I am from NY, I have had pizza experiences galore. However, any human needing to eat needs to avoid this place. . First of all, there was no staff- just one young lady attempting to do about 4 jobs. This place needs proper staffing in a big way. She was the cashier, bartender, waiter, etc. . We ordered a large pizza with 2 toppings, well done. It arrived, not well done, WITHOUT sauce!!!!!!!!!!. The most tasteless, dryest, horrible pie I ever had!!!!!. Please avoid this place at all costs.","Sooo its my day off I'm starving all sorts of Somalian like. I only decided to order from Caliente because I trust Nichole. No offense Jarrett. I called at around 10:30 hoping theyd still be delivering and yes they were. I explained to the guy on the phone I'd never ordered from them before and he said he wasn't busy and would not mind explaining what was on the menu. I ultimately decided to order a Traditional Cheese Pizza. 30 minutes later pizza at my door and good pizza at that.","We were downtown and we decided to come here for supper. The decor and atmosphere is great here. The waitress asked us if this was our first time here and when we said yes she went on to describe every dish on the menu ( a bit too long). We ordered the Sophia pizza and the Napoli pasta. The food was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The prices were comparable to prices at other similar restaurants. Not sure if I will return.","My girlfriend and I stopped on our anniversary for lunch/dinner and we were so happy with everything!  We started with wings and man they were good but also not the same as a traditional wing. They were not sauced but rather naked wings with onions and a side of foccia bread. Also an order of meatballs and to say they were awesome was an understatement words could not describe how good they were. . . they were a fine ground up meat with almost a creaminess to it. . . in a tomato sauce that was orgasmic. . . it also came with some fresh ricotta cheese and a sprig of basil and also some foccia bread. . . next time I'm just going to get a pot of meatballs because they are the bomb. . . then the main course the coal fired pizza it was so good with a fresh tomato sauce and fresh cheese. . . only knock on the pizza was that the crust needed dipping sauce to dip your crust into or sauce put to the full edge because it was dry once you got to the edge. . . over all this place was an excellent place to have dinner at and I recommend going to Anthony's it is worth the money!","I live literally a stones throw from this store. Really, I have my pick of stores since Longo's and the great canadian superstore are close as well. I was so happy when their sobeys reopened with a new image to keep the competitive edge. Great products, fresh produce and meats. What I love most is the cooking station. Whenever I visit, I bee-line it for the chefs station. On a daily basis they have a recipe for you to sample with the recipe print put  and all of the ingredients right there if you want to make it. I have tried many and they have all been quick, easy and delicious. I spoke with the manager once and complimented the station idea and Serge the chef who creates the recipes. He told me that it was an investment to bring a chef in, and he was chosen after a six month search. The only thing I'm not thrilled with is the hot food station. Tried it a couple of times and thought the food tasted like it had been out too long. It may be that there is so much to choose from that they can't possibly move it fast enough. It's still a good option if you are hungry. Oh, the exception would be the pizza which was good. All in all, my go to grocery store. :)","Used to work across the street and always wanted to stop by. and when I finally had the chance to I was amazed! The waitress told us her favorites and also to try thier homeade sausage. So we did and it is like nothing I have had before, not the usual, but it is sure delicious. The crust wasn't to thick or thin either and I loved it. I also had to try the blt pizza, lettuce and tomato atop a pizza with mayo! Who would have ever thought, it was soooo good. My kinda pizza for sure. The beer prices are extraordinary and always affordable. I have eaten here many times since and it has always been a nice experience, I have even taken my little sister and they give them dough and utensils to play with! A great idea so they don't get anxious waiting for food! I will continue going and if your looking for pizza that isn't just the ordinary new york slice, this is your place! Its a must try for great pizza!","First of all, the entrance is on Portland street about halfway between King and Adelaide. Overall assessment: the food was 4 stars and the ambiance and service was 5 stars. My husband and I came here for dinner on a Monday night. The place was very busy for a Monday. We sat at a high top communal type bar table but there were also plenty of private tables. The waitress was incredibly nice and helpful. She recommended a charcuterie board for us and it was phenomenal. It came with little tiny bite size garlic knots that were so tasty. My husband ordered a pizza and liked it very much. It came whole with scissors to cut it which was different. I had the Bronzino and it was good. It didn't come with a vegetable and the waitress asked if I wanted to add one and I declined because I thought it would be too much food after the appetizer. I should have added a vegetable. The Bronzino was good but it's nice to have a side to switch up flavors.","Oh man . . . this is NOT good pizza . . . it's CHEAP and they usually have an all you can eat lunch buffet but the 'za is about as good as Little Caesar's Pizza (i. e. \"not so much\")","Ordered the tacos and the carne asada burrito enchilada style; burrito was not amazing. For the tacos it was pretty good. Tortillas' outer edge was crispy and the rest was soft. They were awesome asada tacos (cilantro, onion) with both the green and red sauce and some lime. The enchilada style burrito was underwhelming otherwise. The enchilada style sauce is nowhere near spicy. Would compare the sauce on the burrito to marinera sauce from a pizza place. Really sweet and not spicy which is supposed to be. Wish they made the enchilada style sauce 100x spicier. Not spicy at all for enchiladas. Even Robertos has a better wet style burrito spicy and taste wise. Tacos here are better tho for sure.","GREAT food!  Stylish little boutique that seats maybe 10 people. They do takeout. This is real restaurant food, not fast food, so you pay for it. But if you want quality in a pinch (I get takeout for dinner at work nearby) it's very nice to have so near. The pizzas are superb, if a bit light on ingredients. Try their salmon salad. It's greens, with a huge portion of smoked Norwegian lox on top. . . very nearly a meal in itself. The calamari is great, with 2 great dips. The pastas are also excellent. I've never been to the main restaurant around the corner, but I imagine it's the same (but bigger).","A big bright brand new store and its close to home. Wow, impressive. This place took me by surprise with the prepared meal section, the freshly made pizza that could rival any pizzaria, and some niche items like quail, which you dont find in every meat department. So as i made my way though the store with my eyes open wide to take it all in, i must admit the produce is some of the best i have seen. You dont usually see this quality of fresh veggies unless its a small privately owned store so obviously these guys are picky about what is displayed on their shelves. The next thing that caught my eye was the abundance of choice in the meat department. Price wise, not much different than anywhere else, but selection wise, they are a step above. I must also complement them on the artisan bread section. Now that alone is worth a visit. And to think i only stopped there to pick up some milk and take a peek at the new store, and it cost me $50 to get out of there because i had raspberries, bread, ribs, milk, cheese, pickles, bbq sauce, and a duck. . . . . . ya, a duck. . I'll be back but i have to remember not to go shopping before dinner next time.","This review is for the mini-golf, the arcade, and the general ambience/service. . We have Pogo Passes and wanted to use them for some cheap family fun. We took our daughters (ages 5 and 4), planning to bowl, mini-golf, see a movie, and maybe have some pizza. . There was only one person ahead of us at the register when we got there, but we still ended up waiting in line for several minutes. We were told that our Pogo Passes were not valid that night (Saturday), which is obviously our fault for not checking, but is perhaps a policy they should reconsider. We decided to do mini-golf anyway (it's fairly cheap), and went back there ready for some fun. . And. . . it really wasn't fun. Our younger daughter was scared by the large murals of huge sea creatures (sharks, giant squid, etc. ) and the eerie pirate music (which was very loud at at least a couple holes). And it didn't take us long to realize that the course was all but unplayable. Weird obstacles just thrown in the middle of the course, tiny tunnels to get through (one of which had a hole in the middle of it, so your ball got stuck if you did manage to get it through), and open ended greens that let your ball go flying onto the next hole if you overshot. Sure, our kids had an okay time hitting their balls aimlessly, but it was honestly just no fun for the adults, and I'm sure the kids would have been happy to skip it. . By this time, we had decided to go elsewhere for dinner and a movie (that's how bad the \"golf course\" was). But we had already paid for some arcade games, so we headed over there. . The games seemed to be either \"jackpot\" games (like try to win the impossible jackpot of tickets) or shooting/racing games, with ski ball, basketball, and air hockey thrown in. There were also a couple \"claw\" games, where you try to get the impossible prize. So again, not great for younger kids, and cheap feeling for the adults. The worst part about the arcade experience, though, was that the card that you swiped to play the games. It's a good idea to have a digital card with a balance on it instead of tokens, but that thing was very difficult to get to work. It never worked on the first try. Not once. Sometimes we couldn't get it to work at all, and we'd have to skip the game entirely. . As far as the general ambience goes. . . it seriously felt like a 10 year old place, even though it's brand new. It felt very \"budget\" and not exciting or modern. The employees we dealt with were not particularly friendly or unfriendly. . . they were just kind of there, some of them working, some of them chatting amongst themselves. . It really was a disappointing experience. We will go back to try the bowling, since we have the Pogo Passes, but I don't have high hopes for it anymore. I hope they make some big changes to help this place reach its potential, before too many people are turned off like we were.","It's the chipotle of pizza places. Quick, good but a little on the pricey side of things. It's no Grimaldis or Spinatos but for lunch it's pretty darn good. I'm a fan of salads so the Chicken, gorgonzola and pine nuts is always a nice change up in the week. The Paninis are also tasty and nicely size and the pizza - like I said pricey but good. I like thin crust - that's probably the biggest thing. Fresh, light and not too much for lunch.","Decided to eat here because of other Yelpers. I'm not a big pizza person, but the boyfriend is and it was his turn to pick the restaurant. I am so glad we ate here. The pizzas are amazing. They are Italian pizzas not American pizzas so you'll find they have no tomato sauce. Trust me you don't miss it. We had the margarita, Hawaiian, mushroom, and BLT. You get a discount for ordering four small pizzas. They were out in minutes and disappearing off our plates just as fast. . They also serve pastas but we were too stuffed to try them. He said he makes his own sausage and mozzarella, and he was making dough while we ate. You can buy pizza crust cooked or frozen as well. . We heated up our left overs in our Nuwave oven, so we didn't have an issue with the crust as another reviewer mentioned. . We can't wait to go back!!! :)","Always have great pizza from here from the crust to the sauce and also how the cheese on top is golden brown. The owner is a very nice guy who is honest he cooked a medium for me instead of a large and let me have the medium and refunded my money Wow! I highly recommend getting pizza from this place and supporting the hardworking owner who runs in it I'm lucky it's super close but would. Drive across town to pick it up","Had a blast. Really fun learning about some of the local craft brewers and drinking their beers. I had no clue some of these places existed so it was awesome to try some of these great beers. . Our first stop was at Bad Beat. (which deserves a review on its own soon)  Got to meet the brewers, toured their facilities, learned a little bit about the process and how they got started. Really informative if you're into beer. . Then we drank. It was 6 samples of some of their favorites. They were all very good. Some impressively good. Go there, or find there beer. . Steve our tour guide, and rad dude, rounded us up and we were off to the next spot. . Chicago Brewing in Summerlin was the next stop and was pretty impressive. We sat upstairs and could see down into the brewery. We had their stout and ipa, both of which were quite good. I liked the stout more. They fed us some appetizers and then we were on our way again. . We got dropped off on Fremont and went into Banger Brewing, which is a pretty awesome spot downtown for a good beer. Steve told us a little about the place and then we got another I'll flight of beers to taste. I like the ipa a lot and found the jalapeno beer to be really interesting. It would be awesome with pizza. . Really a great time. Can't wait to do it again. They said they'll be going to different breweries in town so it won't always be the same. . I you love beer you'll love this tour.","This place is really fun and different. The food is a little pricey for what you get, in my opinion, but it tastes sooooo good. The pesto burger rocks, garlic fries, and the BBQ chicken pizza, are also good. Your timing needs to be good, because the place can get packed quickly, with lines out the door. The wrong time of year, and the indoor seats are noisy and cramped, and the outdoor seats are abuzz with flies.","I don't normally write reviews however I just spent $8. 00 on a greasy, warm(not hot) piece of pizza and a salad (that went straight to the trash it was so awful). Save your money I would rather have a Little Caesar pizza then eat at Rays again.","I love this food truck. In my books, this is the best pizza in Champaign. They are super friendly and always helpful. Their pizza comes out fast (90 seconds if there's no line) and within 5 minutes if there is a line (after you place your order). They have the standard toppings -- pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, etc. . . . as well as some different pizzas such as dragon fire (green chile sauce, jalepenos, hot sausage and to make it spicier -- ghost peppers) and once in a while, a SMORES pizza -- marshmallows, m&amp;ms, chocolate sauce. . . . so good. And they even have a secret menu -- ie. brisket BBQ!!!!    The crust is soft, chewy AND foldable!!   They have an awesome char on the bottom and the cheese is to die for. Everything is spot on!!!  No complaints!!!  They were even nice enough to drive out to our house and cater my 5yr old's birthday party --- they were a hit with everybody!!!!. I love this place. Follow them on twitter or FB to figure out where they're going to set up for the day!!!","The pizza here is great. I just wish they offered a personal size. My husband loves plain pepperoni. I am more adventurous but had to take one for the team because the pizzas are fairly large and they don't allow you to split the toppings half &amp; half. We ate outside. The atmosphere was very nice and the service was great but the seat cushions were absolutely filthy.","My wife and I each had pizzas, which were wonderful, but the highlight was probably the delicious buffalo mozzarella. It was smooth and savory and went great with the tomato and basil on the plate. . Ambiance is super casual, and I like that it's quick, but not fast :)","Had popped in here for a quick bite when was meeting with a client. Great little place with awesome atmosphere and the pizza was deeeelish. . . . Portion size was great and got a belly full of food to carry on with the day. . .","Finally checked this place out. I've read reviews that it's NY style and I do miss pizza from the big apple and can only have it when I'm visiting home, so finding a place that can answer the crave is definitely a plus. . I came here on a Saturday night, around 9PM, and there was a family eating there and 2 other pairs of people who were either waiting on their order or just chillin with their beer. Since I just wanted to try them out, I asked if it was possibly to purchase a slice even though it was outside lunch hours. The lady taking the order asks her cooks if there's slices left, to which they did. I'm relieved, but I'm worried my food won't be as good since it didn't sound like it would be freshly made. I wait about 10 minutes and they bring my pizza to me. You can see for yourself in the picture. . . definitely NY style pizza!! It was thin, super cheesy, and *surprise* super greasy. What pizza is grease free and tasted decent anyways? The pizza was good and I wish they were closer to work since their lunch deals sound pretty awesome!! I wouldn't say their pizza tasted mind blowing or anything, but I wouldn't oppose having it again. I did give 3 out of 5 stars since the table I was sitting on smelled like they wiped it with something that should've been washed. Or maybe change out the water it came from (the little wipe bucket was right by the cashier), more soap maybe???. . . the smell wasn't overbearing though. There were TV's and selection of beers and my slice was around $2, less than $3. Can't beat that!","Food is good and I dont mine waiting awhile for delivery. But we got the wrong pizza (which it happens) I called and they said the would switch the pizzas out. So delivery man came back and we swaped pizzas. I was reassured that mine was in the delivery car the whole time. I know they gave the pizza I had in my house that I opened to someone else. I lost my trust in them. I know I am a clean person and did not touch the pizza it self. But what if I did something to it? You dont know now days. Should be once out of the sight of the driver you cant give it to anyone else. Then I cant get their contact page to work on the web sight. Will give them a call tomorrow.","This is for the new owner:  \"that guy's pizza\". . I've had bad luck getting pizza at this place in the past. Very bad customer service, below average. Pizza. And had decided not to bother anymore. But, I thought I'd try again after reading it was under new ownership. Let me tell you, a world of difference!  . I didn't call ahead. I just came in and ordered. Took about 15 minutes. Pizza was hot, cooked just right, and the ingredients tasted fresh (this was a problem under old ownership of the past). And to top it off, they even cut the pizza the correct way, unlike so many Arizona pizza joints who insist on cutting pizza in child like bite size squares.  (Seriously. I've lived in over 15 different states and have never seen that unless it was a rectangular party type pizza). . Once they have delivery open, fountain hills will finally have a fantastic delivery option and Pizza Hut won't be the king of delivery in FH anymore.","Where to start!  I've had one amazing experience with them and one. . . INTERESTING experience. . I placed my most recent order via just-eat. ca in advance, for it to be delivered at 6:45pm. At 4:45- I get a call. They're at my condo (I'm at work) and i said. He grumbled slightly and said they'd have to make it again. . 5:30pm rolls around. Get another call. They're at my condo again. (I'm still at work). He grumbled slightly and said they'd have to make it again. . 6:45 rolls around. Nothing. I call the restaurant after a few minutes to make sure there wasn't something weird going on- and our buzzer rings while I'm on the phone. He's here!. Head down. Order isn't complete. A whole pizza is missing. He told me I only ordered two pizzas (incorrect) until he actually looked at the receipt. He then proceeded to indirectly blame me for the the fact that three poor drivers have had to bear the blistering cold to bring me my pizzas and that the restaurant doesn't even look at the time on the receipt- just what's being ordered. I didn't understand how that was my problem and I refused to a) be spoken to like that and b) pay for an incomplete order. I told him to take it back to the restaurant because I didn't want it anymore. . I went back to my apartment and called the restaurant and explained what happen, and the nice lady put the owner on for me to speak with. I told him what had gone on and even though I really didn't want the pizza anymore, he said he'd deliver it to me himself and pretty much offered me anything extra I wanted- I told him he could surprise me with a dessert. . Well he did. He brought the pizzas, 4 desserts and some calamari (holy crap) to me personally and apologized for the mix-up. I felt horrible for him for having to deal with this, but was very thankful to receive such great, personal service. It shows how much pride he really takes in his restaurant and that says a lot. . The food was incredible- I'm actually in physical pain from eating so much of it so fast- it was that good. I will order from them again in the future (if they'll let me) but will probably never order in advance again as that seems to be where the main issue was.  . Thank you!","*3. 5 stars. I was invited to Cibo Yorkville's preview dinner. The location is great and the space is beautiful. I thought that the service was wonderful and overall I had a good experience. . I think all the tables got random menu items to sample. We started with a beautiful charcuterie board with a nice selection of meats and cheeses. My friend and I both enjoyed it a lot. . For mains, we were given a roasted chicken and an artichoke pizza to sample. The roasted chicken was well cooked, even though it looked almost a little undercooked around the leg. Could be a tad more flavourful. . . But we both enjoyed the veggies and potatoes on the side. . As for the pizza, my friend found a piece of hair in her slice, so that sort of ruined it for both of us. . For dessert, we were served a delicious tiramisu- the portion size was very generous. We were very pleased. . One complaint I did have is that the drinks were very watered down (I had a mojito and a sangria). But I'm not sure if it's because this is just a preview dinner. This is one area that I think they can improve. . On the whole, they have some kinks to work out, but we had a pleasant experience and would return to try again.","Love fired pie. It's always a great day when I treat myself to FP. The assembly line pizza concept. The price point is unbeatable, and you don't have to settle for the toppings your group wants. Plus the crust is the perfect thickness and crispness. Try mixing the mozzarella with the buffalo mozzarella. And load up the toppings because they are unlimited. Yum.","This is by far our favorite pizza joint in town. The owner is friendly and the place is clean. Be prepared, one slice of pizza takes up two plates! The pizza is great!","This place is a mess. Called on Saturday evening 6:20 PM.  10 minutes on hold, hung up. Called back and ordered 2 pizzas. At 8:00 no pizza so a I called back, manager tells me they see that I ordered, but whoever took the order didn't hit the send button. Uhhh, ok. Puts me on hold, after 10 minutes I hang up. I call back, no apology, but took the order again and said they'd rush it out in 25 minutes. An hour later no pizza, I call back. They have no record of my order. Manager doesn't know who I am. I tell him what happened and that I had talked to the manager, he tells me they have different manager. He asks if I want to reorder, I can tell that this is actually the manager and he does apologize. No pizza that night. I've ordered from this place dozens of times over the years and never had a problem, but something has changed.","Pizza was ok. Service was not so great. If you like attentive service and good pizza for a good price, don't come here. . . . go to spinattos! I ordered a spinach pie, and could count on one hand how much spinach was in it. Garlic bread had no garlic. Crust is decent but has no taste. One last thing. . . dont order the antipasto salad. 16 dollars for a big bowl of nothing. We won't be coming back.","I ordered this once as delivery. Looking at their menu, I thought they were not competing on price, they must be competing on quality. I realize what they are really doing is offering unusual sushi. I ordered spring rolls, sushi pizza, green dragon roll, sushi sliders and a kimchi/beef roll. (two very adventurous choices and two sushi choices, while non-traditional but more common sushi choices) . I had no idea what to expect with sushi sliders - they are blocks of rice with a wedge of salmon inside. Unusual but not bad. The Kimchi roll was a disaster, really does not taste good. While I knew this roll would have been hard to pull off, I gotta say as someone who makes his own bulgogi and homemade kimchi, both were worse than I make myself. I had to throw some of this out, which is a big minus for me. The Sushi pizza was actually very cheap at 4. 50, but it wasn't covered in topping. It was cut in fours making it impossible to manipulate with chopsticks. The Green Dragon Roll and Spring Rolls were perfectly fine, and gave me hope that many of their other items might be adequate. Having to throw away sushi because I didn't like it, would be enough for this to merit one star, but I have to concede its a highly experimental roll so I knew I might not like it. I would choose someone else for either price or quality. . I would not recommend it and would not order from this place again.","First of all, great customer service ! Also, amazing pizza !! Would definitely recommend!","Excellent Pizza, great service, nice atmosphere. I love their pizza, wings, and meatballs. The sausage and brocolli rabe pizza is phenominal!  The pizza does get some char from the coal oven which I feel adds to the flavor. I am sure this is not for everyone but I love it. Better than Gateway grills pizza BY FAR!","When a friend was in town visiting, staying at Harrah's, I thought, \"finally, my chance to go to Fukuburger!\" Alas, when we got there, it was closed for renovations!??!. My heart sunk because I knew our options were so limited. We went to Flour &amp; Barley basically because it was there. . Overall: overpriced. $15 for Big Dog's beer. $15-20 for pizza. We ordered one of the \"fancier\" pizzas with all kinds of cool veggie toppings, but instead they brought us pepperoni. The pepperoni was not even good. I wish I could have judged one of the other fancy pizzas, because it looked like the toppings would make it delicious. Oh well, because I'll never go back. The cheese was all rubbery, when it should have been those slices of fresh mozzarella. Sauce was just meh. . Only thing saving it was the super friendly service from the hostess and the meatballs. If you have to go, order the meatballs (even though they're $15 for 3!).","Very good doesn't do this awesome pizza joint justice. . Youll have to make up new words when you bite into their delicious crispy crust yet the top is light as air. Topping qre high quality. Please do your self a favor and try the meatballs. They are top notch made fresh daily.","Ordered a couple pizzas and a bottle of water for delivery from the McKnight Rd Pizza Hut. My husband paid in cash and when he came inside I saw that we didn't get the bottle of water and the pizza didn't have all the ingredients on it that we asked for. When I called to have it fixed, some Pizza Hut operator told me that he couldn't get the McKnight store to pick up the phone and that more often then not they stop answering after 9PM because they don't want any more orders because the store closes at 10PM. That's fine except I wasn't placing a new order I was just trying to get the order that I already paid for! He told me I should try to call back the next day. Seriously? Ridiculous.","We got the white veggie pizza with added bacon and it was probably one of my favorite pizzas I have had. It was so good!! This is definitely our new to go pizza place!","Great service from the staff, the thing about this place is you get good food at reasonable prices. Their pizzas, burgers, poutines, etc, are nothing to rave about but aren't bad either. Good, decent food at reasonable prices, and a nice friendly staff.","Novanta is hands down the best pizza joint in Madison. They have a great location, great pizza, fast service and great employees working there. I recommend this place to all my friends when they come down to Madison.","Came here after walking out of the dumpy Mexican place across the street. I couldn't be happier with the experience here. Was greeted by three people at the front door and immediately seated. Being from Chicago and from the pizza business, I was skeptical but, the place smelled right. Joseph waited on us and was great. We had a 16\" half cheese and half sausage thin crust. The sausage and sauce were just like some of Chicago's best. The crust was a little thin for me but, crispy and tasted great. I will be coming back here with the rest of my family soon. HIGHLY recommend that you try this place if you want Chicago style pizza.","Without bashing the entire franchise, Giordano's is a great pizza stop on the south side of chicago. Growing up 10 minutes away from the original location means you spend a lot of time there. Since moving to arizona less than a year ago, I was excited to see Giordano's had made its way west. After trying their pizza 3 times, it proves me right that any pizza here is incomparable to chicago and it's somewhat embarrassing to the original locations. Nothing tastes the same and it's always a long wait just to be disappointed in the product. Apparently, if I want good pizza i'm going to have to go back home for that.","I seem to be just a bad review giver, and I swear I am not. First and for most this review is only for this location because I went to two. Now, the guy at the first one (on Tenaya) was the most friendliest, nicest, helpful man I've encountered in a while. There was an error with the online ordering, so my pizza was at this location (Charleston). Now the man at the Tenaya location was very concerned and helpful with helping me get to the right location and apologized for the error even though it wasn't on his account. This was awesome and I will make sure my encounters are only with the Tenaya location. . . Now, the nitty gritty of this crap. We walk in, not greeted, the man sighs as if the appearance of my life is the absolute most disgusting piece of any human experience. I pay and we leave. I got two pizzas and garlic knots. On the way home my kid was starving so I hand her a garlic knot, she bites it and hands it right back. I taste it, it's not bad but it is chewier than a pack of Super Bubble. Not only were they chewy but on every single one, one side of the knot was extremely hard the. So the tops were perfect, the middle chewy, and the bottom hard as wood. I could understand a few or maybe even half BUT EVERY SINGLE ONE!? The pizza is sweet, not in a good or a bad way, just in a weird way that I had never experienced before. The pizza is okay, it was not hot when I picked it up, so maybe that's a factor. I kind of went into it expecting New York style pizza but that's not at all what this is. First time here, I may go back to Manhattan Pizza but only for the great service from the man on Tenaya.","The garlic chicken pizza is definitely my favorite. 24/7 delivery . You cant beat it.","Ordered a pick up special, great pizza was  cooked just right, good customer service, I'll definitely be coming back.","They messed up the first pizza, no cheese on one side  (how that happens is beyond me). So we waited for a replacement which was even worse,  barely any sauce and less cheese than the first one. They did give us both pizzas for the price of one else, but it should have been free.","Pop Up Pizza is great because of the price, the location and especially the food. The White Chapel, or \"white pizza\" is incredible with no tomato sauce but still tasty with ricotta and spinach. The traditional pepperoni pizza outdoes other traditional pizzas offered at other places. The other specialty pizzas such as The 18b with basil and fresh herbs topped with grated mozzarella cheese, or The Goodman made with mozzarella, caramelized onions, mushrooms, spinach, and potatoes or The Fremont made with mozzarella, Italian sausage, bacon, pepperoni, roasted peppers, and roasted eggplant are excellent at an even better price. . This is located in the Plaza Hotel and Casino in downtown Las Vegas but the vibe is fun, funky and urban so live a little and enjoy the rejuvenated Fremont Street.","Please beware, this is not Italian food. I ordered a fish special from the chalk board that claimed to come with spinach risotto. The fish had a terrible taste and the risotto was uncle bens rice with some spinach tossed in. I love risotto and it is supposed to be made from short grained arborio rice and should be creamy and served al dente. This long grained rice was boiled to the point of being overcooked and simply slapped on my $29 plate. The  more I think about it the angrier I get. . The Mediterranean pizza was closer to but not as good as pizza pizza rather the an authentic Italian pie.  . This restaurant may draw tourists and unwitting torontonians who don't know better, but I would not go back to an Italian restaurant that doesn't know what risotto is.","-- THIS REVIEW IS BEING DIRECTLY ADDRESSED TO THE OWNERS --. In a nutshell -- you've got the right idea, at the right location, with the wrong prices.  . As soon as possible your pizzas need to drop to no more than $12 each. Why? They are the lightest and fluffiest pizzas I've had in some time. Kinda Wonder Bread Pizza, which isn't the worst thing in the world. It's actually kind of cool -- but not at $20 a pop for a 'snack' pizza which doesn't quite feed one. . Your target customer is someone who doesn't want to spend this kind of money on the strip. That's kind of what the Linq is all about. Anti-Casino. Being outside and freer somehow. Gouging on airy pizza is a serious mistake. . The pizzas my partner in crime and I had were tasty, mind you. And the salad we ordered was delicious. But ripping people off because 'it's the strip' is STUPID.  It will lead to very hesitant recommendations and hesitant repeat business. . A personal pizza that is so light and airy would be about $6 anywhere in the real world, for in order to feel full, you'd either have to order a second or a side dish. Adjusting for the strip location and such, $10 feels about right. . DROP YOUR DAMN PRICES.","Had this when I was in Chicago and was so unbelievably excited when I saw they had one in Arizona  (I just moved from Portland. ) Best pizza.","Yummy pizza. Great service and their pizza cookie with ice cream is awesome. The pan pizza takes 45 minutes or so to cook so if that's your thing be sure to call and order ahead! :)","My wife and I stopped in on our way to a concert. We were seated immediately, and our waitress came right over to get our drink order and bring us water. We started with some appetizers. Got the carpaccio and bruschetta. Both were very good, and almost enough to just have for dinner. My wife ordered the Brussels sprouts salad, and I had the chicken pesto pizza. They were both excellent. We had a great experience there with great service, and will definitely go back.","Going to Char was a pleasant experience. It was recommended to me by Smith B. It's a clean, and fairly large establishment, with plenty of seating and a built in bar. . I really like the seating options here. You can sit at the bar if you want that 'drink' experience. There are high tables and booths if you are with your family. Dining 'al fresco' is also an option. . . if you are on that special date. . . . . Food service is similar to pieology, or similar 'make your own pizza'  restaurants. You walk up, choose your type of pie, and add your toppings. . I went a little crazy with my toppings, but my pizza tasted good. It had mild sausage, meatballs, a lotta ricotta, fresh mozzarella, spinach, mushrooms, and garlic. . We also shared bruschetta as an appetizer. They use crispy toast as the base and add fun and interesting toppings. The best part is everyone can get the their favorite because they let you 'mix and match'. I don't remember which ones we ordered, but they were all tasty. . The service here was mostly friendly. The manager came by to check on us and the cashier was very nice. I would definitely come back.","We were here on July 4, 2015 for an early birthday celebration. Upon arrival the hostess was no where to be found, off doing other things I presume, after waiting for several minutes we final were seated. We were seating in a booth (by choice) which was quite small. It was a squishy fit for 2 people. After again waiting for 10 minutes our server came over and took our drink order and food order. . I ordered a pasta dish, and my boyfriend ordered a make your own pizza dish. Both were quite yummy. . We asked for more bread and took quite awhile to get more. . Aside from the slow service (and it wasn't a busy night) and small booths the celebration was great. Would hope for better service next time, but we are starting to think that Oakville has poor service everywhere. The price was great (can't beat all you can eat salad or soup and bread as an appy).","It isn't often I feel like I could eat somewhere every day but truth be told the food here is some of the best I've ever eaten. The multiple times I have been there now I have not been disappointed. . Most recently I had the pleasure of tasting their chicken hummus pizza and it is of of the absolute best things I have eaten in my life. Everything tastes so fresh and the food has always come out hot. . But no business would be able to stand without its staff and that is one of the shining moments of my experience with this place. All but once I have gone in and been waited on by the server Alyssa and each of those times have been excellent. The one time I was not the service was still fabulous but I have unfortunately forgotten the male server's name. . Alyssa is a wonderful example of good customer service, she reads her customers very well and is quick to offer different options to those who seem unsure. Every time I have come in and asked her opinion I have not been disappointed. She is an amazing server and that service and the great food will definitely keep me coming back!. Oh and the last time I was in I found out you can have their food delivered through Grub Hub! Thanks again to the wonderful Miss Alyssa I can now have baklava delivered to my front door!","Great pizzas and pastas. Prices are well below average and the food is delicious!","Caliente is my new favorite happy hour spot. They have a great selection of craft beers that is constantly changing. During usual times the beer can get a bit pricey but all craft beers are half off for happy hour and its the perfect place and time to try out new things. The staff are attentive and friendly and their pizza is also good. But as far as craft beers go, it's the best place to get a wide selection in the area and youll never get tired of the same old thing because it is always changing.","This place was very good. My girlfriend is a pain in the ass when she orders, and our server Tyler did a great job catering to her. He brought different beers to taste and answered a million questions. Tyler was knowledgable and very friendly. Food was amazing. The tater tot nachos were superb as was my brisket sandwich. Girlfriend had an artichoke, garlic, and chicken pizza that was very good as well. Great atmosphere.","Been going here since I was a kid and getting the same thing ever since. . Salad is the bomb! . Homemade angel hair is the stuff of dreams. . . . And you gotta take home a pizza for a midnight snack. . . delicious!","Great food, great prices, but the shop is a little cramped, even for a pizza joint. The food is worth it tho!","I can't speak to the quality of the pizza here, but the rest of their food was awful. We found a little menu in our door and thought we'd give it a shot by ordering the buffalo chicken fingers with a side of Greek fries. On the menu its listed as 10 or 6 wings for $6. 99 (which doesn't make a lot of sense) but when we ordered on the phone were told it was TWELVE for $6. 99, something we confirmed three times before hanging up. The food took about an hour to show up, which isn't that bad. What was bad were the fries, which were nowhere near being done. They were a wet, soggy mess and a total write off. The chicken fingers tasted like they were frozen, microwaved, then brought to us an hour later. To cap things off, this whole debacle cost $20. We asked for a couple extra ranch dips, they charged us a buck each for three of them. Then they charged us $9. 99 for the chicken (even though we confirmed the $6. 99 price 3 times on the phone) and $2. 99 for the uncooked fries. Add the delivery charge and tip and we were left $20 poorer and still hungry 90 minutes later. Based on this experience I wouldn't dare try ordering a pizza or anything else from here.","Went here for our department's Christmas celebration. Originally it was supposed to be held at the location in Westmount but it was changed last minute to the new location outside the Faubourg which was probably a lot better since this restaurant recently opened so was not crowded and it was a shorter walk from a metro than the location at Westmount. . I found service to be okay but a bit chaotic as my order was mixed up by different people bringing different items (ex: asking for something from one server and then someone else putting it on the table; sometimes at the wrong spot; this happened for one of my beers as well as my dessert). This place has a lot of different types of pizzas and pastas but I opted for their Italian Poutine to give it a try. I also had a 20oz Stella Artois. The Italian Poutine wasn't what I preferred. It has a meat ball on it (which I found interesting) but I wasn't impressed by the sauce nor how they made the fries. I can't really say much about the beer since I'm not a heavy beer drinker but I asked for another Stella Artois after I finished my first. When most people finished their meals, the server gave us the dessert menu. Most people didn't order dessert but I decided to get the cheesecake Amarena. It was very good. A few minutes after the server gave me my dessert, since some people from our party were starting to leave (but the people in my area were still around), she asked if I minded paying now. I mentioned that I didn't have any issues with it and she handed me my bill, I noticed that I wasn't charged for the cheesecake and being the honest person I am, asked about it and she mentioned that they put it on someone else's bill by mistake (he hadn't paid yet and this was one of the items which was brought to the wrong spot after I ordered it). For some reason I was the only person asked to pay in my section of the table who hadn't indicated that he was leaving. I probably wouldn't have had anything else (like a coffee) after the dessert so it wasn't a big deal. She then left and brought me my new bill. Not including tip, my bill came to $35. 64. I used my credit card so the place accepts credit cards (not sure about debit cards since no one sitting next to me in our party paid or asked about using a debit card). Servers were friendly and polite. Since this place recently opened (maybe less than 2 weeks ago from what I understand), the place was not what I considered to be crowded on the night that we went (Friday night). Our party was ~25 people (which were divided into 2 rows at the back of the restaurant) and there were plenty of empty tables in the restaurant. . I give this place 3. 5 stars which I've rounded up to 4 stars. I would not have any issues coming back for a group/team event but it wouldn't be my first choice. I would probably have one of their pizzas the next time I show up since this is what most people ordered and I wasn't overly impressed by their Italian poutine.","Got into town on the New Years Eve of 2017. Wanted a decent delivery pizza. Chain pizza is a no-no if you know pizza so I gave this place a shot. I have eaten pizza from coast to coast in well over a dozen states. I have lived in PA, CO, CA, GA and spent a lot of time in NYC. I have had lots of pizza and I will give this pizza a 7 out of 10. 10 being the best. I don't have anything bad to say about it, but I have had better. I saw a couple of postings knocking them for the amount of grease the pizza had. Well some of the most pizza in NYC is greasier. . I would order from here again.","I never go to chinatown but now I have reason to.  this place is a GEM randomly in the heart of that area. The inside is super cute with exposed brick and an open kitchen. Started with the calamari which was nothing outstanding, but presentation was cool because the pieces are placed individually onto sticks. . ok so HANDS DOWN the best pizza ever! I am going to dare to say that it is better than Terronis pizza by A LOT. I tried the Gianpaolo -tomato, wild boar cacciatore, funghi, spinach. The fresh tomato sauce was heavenly, the toppings were fantastic (and I don't normally like salami), the crust was amazing, it was just GRAND.  Excellent service by a cute waiter too. Legit my new fav italian resturant.","Great pizza and wings done in the pizza oven. draft beer is always cold and the service is usually great. on our last visit we went on a thursday evening. we were seated as soon as we walked in. the normally great service was just ok this time the waitress didn't seem to friendly or interested in her job, but she got the job done. we will definitely go back one waitress does dot make or break a restaurant for us. while i would give the food 5 stars the prices are a little high and service wasnt great this time so 4 stars for now","Very unique and good italian pizza. I can say it is better than pizza libretto. . The soup and panini was not that good, why doesn't the chef care?. I can recommend this place for pizza to others!","Read this entirely. . Not a bad pizza place. I live in the neighborhood - love this neighborhood, AND all the restaurants in the surrounding location. This place is just OK when it comes to pizza. All pizzas are cooked in a coal oven and taste very good, if you like that kind of pizza. The bar area is also good, however it is a little pricey. BUT, if you are looking to go somewhere for an evening that is nice and has good drink deals and slashed prices on food - THIS is the place to go. they have great deals during weekdays and weekends for drinks - not just beers, but sometimes bloody Mary's and other times, spirits. I recommend THAT. . Overall, I wouldn't skip it but I'm not in love with it. Best of luck in choosing.","Okay so really the pizza here isn't bad. . but it is expensive. So why not pay a few dollars more and get the truffle since all the pizzas are around the same price. So I did like that there was a good truffle flavor (I think they toss some truffle oil to enhance the flavor), however there is wayyy too much cheese. I felt so gross eating, and definitely exceeded by fat content for the week. If you do decide to try this, I recommend just getting a slice, rather than an entire pizza like we did.","Certainly cannot agree with the 4+5 star reviews ot this place, since it may be the most expensive pizza restaurant in Las Vegas. We ordered the Gotham Pizza, which is \"supposed\" to include pepperone, sausage &amp; salami, but there was ZERO salami, &amp; only a smattering of sausage. Perhaps a dozen circles of pepperoni. Lots of cheese if that pleases you? For $28 I think customers should expect something \"better\". Onions? Peppers? Olives? Mushrooms? However, anything above the minimal serving of meat, would push the price well above $30, since each ingredient adds another $2. For those who want to spend $30-40++ on a 16\" pizza, I wish them well. For us -- we go to Wolfgang Puck's in the Crystal Shopping Mall attached to ARIA, &amp; get a better pizza for 1/2 the price.","I'll give a rating of OK.  I have been there twice. The first time I didn't like it at all. The pizza was too burnt. All their pizza ends up a little burnt, but this one was overly burnt. The wings were also flavorless and terrible. . The second time I went was for someones birthday. I kind of went kicking and screaming, but this time the pizza was a lot better, but still not as good as you can get a lot of other places, and it's quite expensive compared to other pizza places. It's not really terrible pizza, but for the big bucks they charge, go somewhere with better pizza.  . So all that being said, would I go there by choice? No.  Would I be ok going back if I had to, yeah.","Two days in a row. . . . need I say more? Friendly staff and amazing food! Steak with bleu cheese and bacon topping, black and bleu burger, garlic chicken pizza. . . we'll be back!!","This pizza is definitely unusual. First off, it's square! Not a rectangle either. Square! It has a satisfyingly crunchy bottom crust, that justified the name crisp pizza. The dough is light and airy. It is closest to a sicilian crust, but not as thick. The sauce has a more fresh \"raw\" flavor than a traditional NY style pie. They finish every pie with fresh basil leaves and a squirt of extra virgin olive oil. A very cool touch. . I tried to order a small pie with half meatball, half mushroom. They said they could only do half and half on large pies. That confused me. I was taught that in the restaurant business, there is always a path to saying yes. And doing a half and half pie is such a normal thing in a pizzeria, I was momentarily stumped. . When I said that for the right price anything in a restaurant should be doable, they replied that the register wasn't set up for it. In the end they find a way to ring it up. $18 and change. To the owner: add a half and half small pizza option to your register please. It's definitely doable! Even if there is a small upcharge for the extra labor. . The mushrooms weren't special at all. I've had some fantastic mushrooms at other joints. The sauce dominated any flavor they might have had, but eating one solo didn't impress. . But the Meatballs! Oh yes! I struggle to find a good new york style meatball anywhere in Arizona. But these nailed it! NY style pizza meatballs are not crumbled beef. They aren't balls or half balls of meat. They aren't small. They are supposed to be flat disks, like large pepperoni. And you should see herbs or garlic in every delicious slice. Crisp's meatballs hit the mark! In the photo, you can clearly see the delicious garlic sparkling in every one. . I liked the music and the cool garage-door store-front. The tables are communal style. They are only open till ten on the weekends, so there won't be any after bar socializing at those tables.","I grew up around the corner from this place so it's kinda my neighborhood pizza spot. I've only had the pizza and salads but everything I've seen come out of that kitchen looks amazing!. Nello's is really known for their deep dish pizza and its my absolute favorite. We order a ton of toppings and its always the perfect ratio for a balanced pizza. I've only come in for pickup so I can't speak to service eating there, but I'm always immediately greeted by someone when I walk in to pickup. . The salads are all well done and my favorite is the chicken gorgonzola salad with their house raspberry vinaigrette dressing. I haven't had one I didn't like. They also have great tvs and I'd def come in for a game. If you live close, walk down to Nellie's. I love this neighborhood and this place!","Great food, but had a terrible large group experience. Last year we had our staff Christmas party at Cibo and had such a good experience that we decided to book at Cibo again this year. We had about 35 guests and did the family-style dinner. Wow, were we surprised when we each received HALF the quantity of food compared to last year and each paid fully TWICE the price as last year!! Unbelievable!! Last year we each paid $40 each (includes gratuity, etc. ) and this year we each paid OVER $80 EACH. Seriously, Cibo. . . who do you guys think you are?? Teatro? Ceasars Steackhouse? Ruth's Chris? You guys serve pizza and fancy pasta. . . Albeit very good pizza and pasta. So we will definitely NOT be having our staff party there next year. Too bad, because they are a great restaurant with great food and atmosphere. Hopefully they can make some changes.","Got the Shipwreck burger and more fries. Really good!! Full of flavor, never had a burger with brie before but I loved it! The mojo fries taste like ranch doritos but better, they've got a hint of a sweet orange zest taste to them that blends in well. Will go back to try the Mac &amp; cheese and pizza.","This is the best pizza iv ever had. The service is friendly and they serve your beer in a mug so cold it makes little ice crystals of beer on top. Seriously, they make them from scratch right in front of you and it's worth the wait!","The chicken and jojos are very good but the two times I tried their pizza I was very disappointed. It was so dry  it was hard to tell which was the pizza and which was the box.","We went here in the early evening and there was no wait. It seemed like a place that has its regular customers. The waitress was very friendly and recommended food for us. I got a Hawaiian pizza that was very good!! My husband had a burger. Prices were good and we will be back!","I haven't been here in many years. place is looking  dated. Same menu . Ordered their  hi Ken with grilled peppers and onions. Chicken waa a little overcooked  but I love the grilled peppers . We ordered their white pizza with fresh garlic. They still put lots of cheese. the neighborhood  is a little dark. prices is reasonable","I went for dinner here with a few friends on a Friday. We ordered cocktails and appetizers to start. The cocktails arrived in time and were really good. I had a negroni which was very nice. . We ordered Asian shrimp and Korean bbq pizza for apps. They were quite spicy and incredibly delicious. Since all of us love spicy food, we were quite happy. For dinner we ordered pasta, coq au vin. The chicken was tender and full of flavor. The pasta was one of the best I have had. We also shared a sweet potato dessert which was very good. Overall everyone loved the food. . I would have given this place five stars but the food took a while to arrive and the ambience is meh for the price. I would like to try this place again soon.","Popped in here while walking up Stephen Avenue, grabbed a beer and pizza with a friend. Very delicious and quick service.","Talk about giant size super size my sandwich why don't ya. This Sports Deli shares seating with the Sports booking area at the Rio Casino. Trust me sport fans when I say you can make a bet on your favorite game and order straight from the Sport Deli and chow down on a monster sandwich. . This place conveniently serves burgers, bratwursts, wood-fired pizzas and even breakfast sandwiches. A cool feature is the open fire pit in the center kitchen area where you can watch your burgers get its grill on.","Always in search of great pizza delivery. This place is an almost. Prompt service and the whole order correct. However, although the pizza crust was perfection (crispy &amp; fluffy light edge with a nice chew &amp; thin, not soggy in the middle) the sauce &amp; cheese lacked a lot. We also got fried pickles. A total hit! YUM! I would still get it again but try more than just a cheese pizza.","Best pizza I've had in Charlotte so far and I've had a lot. Libretto's, Fuel, and Brixx can't touch this place. I wouldn't say it's a bargain, but you definitely get what you pay for. Around $20 bucks for a true, NY style large pizza that I can make 3-4 meals out of, is very reasonable. The ingredients are fresh and the sauce is incredible. My only gripe is that they shutdown for random holidays, but it's family owned, so that's understandable.","Meh. I was so excited to go because the brunch buffet is touted as one of the best in CLT. Not impressed. . Scrambled eggs were dry. Flatbread pizzas were cold. Sausage links were rubbery. Orange juice wasn't freshly-squeezed. . The brewery is spacious and lively and our waitress was great, but the food was truly a disappointment.","Its simple. You can essentially get 2 days worth of food here for $5. 00 based on the prices of their buns its already a winner in my mind. . They have a great selection of buns, and by that i mean they have a better variety than most asiam bakeries that only serve your typical curry chicken bun and bbq pork bun. My 2 favorite buns from them are the pizza bread, which is topped woth bacon onions and tomato sauce, and the drep fried custard bun that is essentially delicous diabetes. Ive never seen any other bakeries sell anything similar to these 2 and they are absolutely delicous, filling, and cheap!! . Aside from buns, they also have a variety of sweet desserts like cotton cake, swiss rolls, japanese cheesecales and regular white cakes.","It's like watching an episode of \"Cheater's\". Or listening to talk radio. . Or peeing out by the dumpster because it's quicker than finding a bathroom. . Or going through the medicine cabinet at my friends hou. . . perhaps I've over-shared!. But you get the idea. . It's a guilty \"pleasure\". . . OK, I'm not sure \"Pleasure\" and Church's really go together (unless you really like rolling around in chicken fat, like I do. . . oop's! over-sharing again!). . . more of a guilty \"thing\". At any rate, I know I shouldn't, but there are times when only a bucket (or in Church's case, a box) of greasy fried chicken will do. . And when that happens, well. . . it's Church's instead of the 11 herbs and spices that theoretically go into KFC (or Kitchen Fresh Chicken. . . or Kentucky Fried Chicken, or whatever the hell they call themselves these days). . A bunch of people showed up for dinner tonight and Church's is the go-to for that kind of thing (at least it is when they all suggest I cook and I say \"thanks, no\" and they give me the \"eeew\" face when I suggest pizza). . As the consummate host, I reminded my guests that Church's:. -  Has never given me the trot's, unlike KFC. . . important since it's my house and me lighting a match is \"optional\";. - Is less expensive than KFC, since I'm buying the feast;. - Goes well with pretty much any wine (OK, I made this last one up but, I figure they won't notice once they have drunk enough of my wine). So Church's. . . perfectly average \"fried\" chicken, for cheap low prices. . Don't even try to tell me that you haven't done it, too!","lets start on the goods. . . The pizza here is by far the best Ive had in Vegas. great flavor and came out surprisingly pretty fast. we ordered just a basic peperoni pizza and i cant wait to eat here again. . the bad. . . . service. sat at the bar last night. the bartenders were so rude and inexperienced. . will defiantly return but sit at a table next time.","Love this place!. While working close by about 10 years ago, some co-workers suggested lunch at Crazy Jim's. I took my family a few times and they liked it too. We lived in Tempe, so it fell off our radar for awhile, but now it is back to regular visits and we've shared the secret with a few others. . . and we moved to SE Chandler and still go!. Baked feta is a great appetizer. I don't know what brand of feta they use, but it's creamy and fabulous. Their pita are just the best - I dream about their deliciousness. Soft on the inside, served warm with a toasty exterior. Yum! We often get the flaming cheese as well - a favorite with the kids. . We like the chicken feta pita, the Ellen pizza, the pasta with mushroom sauce is delicious, salads are good. Don't pass up on the olive oil bread or the homemade taziki sauce. . This place rocks. It's a small restaurant but the food they serve, they do quite well.","2nd time visiting XYZ; 1st time, pizza with friends, zero expectations, . pizza was good, atmosphere ok for a night out with friends - so they delivered. This time, came in for an appetizer and lunch. . Artichoke spinach dip was pretty good . . The ribs. . Not so much. They were dry, no meat and the sauce was served cold on the side. I would come back here for pizza, they have an average selection of tap handles, but definitely not for anything more than that. We sat at the bar, service wasn't bad. Overall experience was good - not great.","Not only is the pizza good, but the wings are AMAZING!!!! I won't have them anywhere else in town now. The new location is great and is a much needed change. The outside patio is great on a sunny day.","Tonight we really enjoy our dinner at Lil Baci. The service was great / personalized and the food was quite tasty / fresh. The choices on the menu are limited (pasta, salad, antipasto, pizza and specials) but you have something for everybody (meat or veggie lover). We sat on the terrace, the weather was great, and it was charming . . . it's true that it was not too busy. We will come back.","I ordered from this store online and they screwed up my order. I called and spoke to manager Mike and he hung up on me because I wanted a refund instead of a credit. I called back and he admitted he hung up on me and said \"the conversation was over. \" He's not management material and what good is a pizza store that can't make an order correctly?","Wow!  New pizza place opened up in  Vistancia and has great food. Everything is cooked fresh in store so no frozen stuff like others. Highly recommend you try it.  . Viloeta helped us and she was amazing!","We read good reviews and went in for lunch in here. It was our Christmas lunch so we were extra generous and patient about everything. The ambience was nice inside the resturant and they had some space outside as well giving the feel of an European street side cafes or resturant. We had ordered spaghetti from the pasta menu and a margarita from the pizza menu. They had decent collection of wine but we went for a cocktail which was nice and refreshing. They had served some complimentary bread which I was very very surprised as it did not taste well at all. Spaghetti was good and the sun dried tomato sauce was very yummy. The pizza was very very average, I would go for a corporate company pizza over this any day. The dough and thus the crust did not taste good at all. All in all I would not recommend this place for pizza and bread crust related food items.","I'm a little biased since we ate at the one in Brooklyn, NY. This one deserves a 3. 5 and can up the scale to the 4 level if the flavor was turned up just slightly on the pizza pie. The flavor on our sausage, pizza, and mushroom fell a little flat. I wanted pizza and beer, so at least I got that, and over all for being located inside a mall pricing was not too bad. Service was good and the atmosphere pleasant; it wasn't NY but I'll settle.","This was great Neapolitan pizza served in a casual upscale spot. Really amazing pizza. I prefer Neapolitan style and have had many across the county and this was in the top 3 ever. Really great!","As is our Friday tradition, some of at the office order lunch and someone pulled out a menu for Angelia's. On this day I decided to get one of the various lunch specials that are offered and ordered an Italian hoagie. . For $7 I got a 12 inch hoagie, a bottle of soda, and an mildly upset stomach. The sandwich was loaded with meat and the toasted bread with barely any of the melted cheese was pretty good. The veggies were a wilted mess though and the bread was on the soggy side by the time I could take a bite of my meal. I used a fork and knife to tackle the unruly hoagie and dipped it in the Italian dressing. I knew I should have ordered my usual, a gyro big enough to keep me full till after quitting time. . On a positive note, the pizza isn't bad. Very greasy but it's a satisfying and there is a nice variety of items on the menu and prices are reasonable. Also, they deliver very quickly.","Great pizza and the meatballs are to die for. I ordered the salad which was gigantic btw, everything all around is great  here","This is a place worth driving to. The gang and I spent an enjoyable Friday night dining at Red, White and Brew. The food was wonderful and the portions so large that we all left with \"doggie bags\". I had the Eggplant Parmesan with homemade marinara. The eggplant was tender and the marinara tasty. This was piled on a heap of pasta and covered with mozzarella cheese. I would say that the pasta wasn't necessary, however. Others had steak, shrimp, and pizza. I highly recommend this place, but you should split the entree.","Great service, I love the pepperoni pizza and they have some great specials. Its a neighborhood shop and easy to get too!","Food: The pasta was very yummy here! We got the beef ragu, peking duck pizza, and kam's alla vodka. All food was very yummy. The pasta did taste a big undercooked and wasn't the PERFECT texture but still very yummy. Nice portion of meat on the beef ragu. The alla vodka sauce was very flavourful. The peking duck pizza was interesting. I couldn't really taste the cheese and the duck pieces were very HARD, too hard to chew but the sauce was very flavourful. Overall, a very different pizza. . Service: It was pretty mediocre. The staff did not seem excited or happy to have customers. Were not particularly helpful. Did not offer help when we were looking at menus by the cashier. I didn't expect too much though as this place is order and then sit down. It was nice they brought us water and food to our table though. . Space: Nice space! Very cozy and tight. . Extras: I really do not like how they increase their prices on food delivery. . . . Cost: I'd say the cost is worth it for the pasta! . I will definitely be back because of the affordability but if prices go up, I'm not sure that I'd be back.","Unfortunately, what is otherwise good Pizza is marred by a terrible ordering and customer service experience. This institution frequently quotes 40 minutes for take out pizza and over the course of three visits the food has never been ready at that time. It is clear that they quote an early time for no good reason. I should not have to add a fifteen minute buffer window and risk my pizza being cold.","Their pizza is one of the best fire oven pizzas I have had. It is my kids favorite pizza in town and the two of them ate a whole pizza by themselves! The meatball sandwich was OK, but wouldn't recommend it. Service is excellent and we like the atmosphere. We will be coming back regularly!","Came here at around 2am and couldn't pick what we wanted so we legit ordered 7 iteams!  All only 4. 95 and honestly EVERYTHING was so good!!! Got tilapia, tacos, pizza rolls , shrimp taco, speghetti, pulled pork burger, . We were served everything in less than 20 minutes and I was sooo impressed. . enjoyed everything I tried , zero complaints !!!","We didn't have the full dining experience because we ordered room service at the Hilton Garden Inn, but the gentleman who took our order had personality for days and made the experience pleasant. Our food was ready quickly and arrived hot and fresh. We devoured the diovala pizza and enjoyed the fresh basil and spicy meat. Can't wait to try the full experience next time but if you are looking for tasty thin crust pizza, give this place a try!","So had no idea there was few Rocco's around town. The first time I came to one was the Rainbow location mainly due the fact close to my house. It was solid experience and won me over with both pizza/pasta dishes. It been while since stop by again but after solid day of training my training partner and I decided on pizza by the slice for recovery meal. He was telling me about other location across from Red Rock Casino. I was like pizza by slice. Hell yay!! . Unlike the rainbow location this one has way WAY more personality. The whole interior set up is much more true to a small pizza joint see in the city. The kitchen is pretty small, they have tiny market section (pasta, can sauces, and little bit of everything), and refrigerator filled with ready to go sauces take home plus few other items. As you walk towards the back of the restaurant to the dining area. It this little hallway that opens up to not very big dining area say less then fifty seats. All the stuff on the way from the photos (ton of family photos, and lot of famous landmark you know in NYC), and some artwork murals again NYC famous landmarks. The table overs with the checkerboard look screams italian. I love the vibe of the restaurant. Just fyi I was telling the guy about the Rainbow location and he told me that the ownership is not the original Rocco owner anymore. Guess he only owns this location and one other location out of three or four believe around town. Fair speaking of the pizza I feel both locations were very good. . We got three pies all together by the slice. I only got one. The sausage and pepperoni. It was awesome. The dough really feel like was true to new york style pie. The sauce and toppings fresh. Maybe they shipped in some of that NYC water because everything about the dough was spot on and the crust addicting. The size of the pizza by the slice another true sign. It nice size. I had one piece hit the spot if had two that like eating small pizza for me. The way serve it on simple plan white paper plate. The price is super reasonable per slice. Really not many pizza places serve by the slice outside of food court in mall. If looking for legit pizza by the slice Rocco's NY Pizzeria. Da bomb.","Order my pizza online and waited for the updates about delivery which never changed. . . . then a text came to my phone 19 mins after it was delivered. After getting the pizza a large two topping thin crust it was burnt, tasted stale, and the meat toppings ( which were only on one side as requested) was oily and dry. Needless to say my kids were disappointed and we threw it out. Not a happy costumer.","Horrible customer service and crazy long wait. . It took 1:45 minutes to get my ordered pizza and wings. I even called back to see if the driver was close and the manager said he'd credit me for the wait. . Soo I called back two days later and the rude staff said we can't just give you free stuff cause your pizza took to long. You are better off going to get a frozen pizza. Don't waste your time or money!","Salad was 3. 5, pizza at 2. 5. We had the 20 dollar pizza/salad special. I thought the price was very reasonable. We had the caprese salad and the sausage pepperoni pizza. the salad was good, albeit a very different take than how capresse is usually served. However, it was good. The pizza was disappointing. It was greasy, and just not particularly great. I would rather eat at Zpizza than here. . The restaurant concept is nice, the service was good, and the ambiance was adequate. However, I don't think I would go back to eat pizza.","Great pep and donair pizza - just make sure they've been made recently - quality decreases pretty fast after its out of the oven. Great crust.","One of the BEST pizza we have ever had. . and that's saying a lot my husband it 100% Italian.","Meh - the pizza is okay!  After all of the positive reviews, my expectations were too high I guess. I ordered the \"Buffalina, \" which is like a margarita except they use buffalo mozzarella. For me, the sauce was subpar. It was super bland. I've had some exceptional margarita pizzas and this wasn't it. . The servers were nice, but service wasn't as attentive as it should have been. We waited a while after being seated to have someone come and take our drink orders. And waited even longer to get our water and beverages. The food, however, came out quick. They were not busy at all for a Saturday night. And after we were done our dinners and they took away our plates, we waited a while to have someone ask us about dessert. We saw several servers/staff just \"chilling\" at the bar area while we waited and waited and waited. In fact, we had to catch the server as she was leaving another table and ask her for the tiramisu. . The tiramisu was actually very nice - it was light and fluffy.  . Don't get me wrong - our servers were very nice, just not very attentive. . Subpar pizza and okay service - I'd give it a miss.","First time dining in at Sauce, it's a fast dine-in type of place that serves pasta, pizza, wine and the like. Definitely casual, decent pricing and good food. . Stopped in with a few gals to have a bite to eat before heading out for cocktails for the night. We decided to share the Wild Mushroom Pizza and the Broccoli Mac &amp; Cheese. . The pizza came with arugula, mushrooms and truffle oil and was delicious. For you thin, crispy crust fans this is it! Crunch and thin crust with light vegetarian toppings! Very good and not too greasy or heavy feeling. The Broccoli Mac &amp; Cheese was good, well cooked pasta, creamy cheese sauce and pieces of broccoli. Definitely a lot better than The Vig's, it wasn't incredibly rich which made for easy eating and definitely second rounds. . The place is casual, but appropriate enough for a meal shared between couples. The staff was very pleasant and made sure we were all taken care of! Definitely, gonna come back to satisfy my thin crust pizza cravings!","This is one of those local restaurants where you know you can bring out-of-towners to that is sure to impress!  The restaurant is built out of the owner Joe Johnston's 1960's childhood home (renovated of course!). The bathrooms feature kitschy glass box displays of vintage Barbies and GI Joes. It's a really cool space!  . You order at the register, are given a vibrating pager, and can choose to sit inside or outside under the trees overlooking the Agritopia urban farming fields. The vibe is super relaxed, patio dog friendly, and most of the vegetables are freshly picked from the aforementioned Agritopia fields -- as fresh and local as produce could possibly get!  The place has even been featured on the Food Network. . Food-wise, everything here is good. Great pizzas (I love the veggie one), burgers, (once again, I'm a fan of the veggie burger), fries (regular, garlic, and sweet potato -- yum!), salads, strawberry lemonade, date shakes. . . the list goes on. . Side Note: Come here on your birthday and get $10 towards your meal (you can also do this at Joe's other 2 local restaurants -- Liberty Market and Joe's Real BBQ if you're up for the challenge!).","We did the walk up slices. Way overpriced and pizza tasted like frozen pizza. They wouldn't give tap water so had to buy bottles. No seating and wouldn't let us sit down in their patio even though it was not busy at all. Tourist trap.","Nello's pizza is near my house. I have eaten in the restaurant several times with my mom and have taken out some for to-gos. The staff is very nice and friendly. When I was waiting for to-go, they asked me if I wanted any drink or water for complimentary service.  . When I ate in the restaurant, I ordered classic cheese pizza with thin crust, which was very delicious. I also ordered pasta which I thought was quite good. . Several times, I decided to go here because although it takes time, the pizza tastes great. The workers at my house ate the pizzas that I brought and they said it was great.","Sent email saying pizza was on its way. Got pizza 40 minutes later. It was cold, and not good. I love pizza hut, but this was disgusting. The box was gross from where pizza had sit for so long.","VEGAN- and GLUTEN-FREE-FRIENDLY!!! This place is GREAT!! The concept is much like Chipotle, except with pizza. You choose your crust (original, whole wheat, or gluten-free), pick your sauce (three different kinds of red sauce, pistachio pesto, alfredo, and bbq), then your toppings. I'm so pleased they offer vegan mozzarella cheese (Daiya, I think). She piled on tons of it and when it came out it was just perfect, gooey and stretchy. It's a little extra for the vegan cheese (and also for gluten-free crust) but it's so worth it for obvious reasons!! Costs just slightly more than a frozen vegan pizza from Whole Foods, but it's so much better - there's nothing like hot, fresh pizza right out of the oven!","I been coming here since I was a kid and I love it!. I could never get sick of this pizza. . Something magical about the sauce they use, and the crust is very original. . I now live in California and I rarely get a chance to enjoy Barros. I have yet to find a pizza place in California that compares. . Barros come to Southern California please!!!!","Visited Marcello's after noticing consistently busy throughout the week. We were warmly greeted upon arrival and seated after a short wait. . - The atmosphere is exceptionally friendly and positive; staff are quick to the table and very attentive. . - Our server was very knowledgeable, and great with recommendations. - Food was exceptional; easily some of the best wood-fired pizza in the city, and for very reasonable prices. Cannot recommend this place enough if you are in the St. Clair West area and are looking for awesome wood-fired pizza in a vibrant setting. . 4 people; Dinner, Drinks and Dessert ~$120 + tip; worth every penny. . I look forward to dining at Marcello's again","I've lived in the neighborhood north of University and west of Farmer (Nuni Wofar) for three years and TFM has been there the whole time. It's open late on the weekends with a pretty good selection of pre-made food, a lot of it is vegetarian or vegan. Anytime I need a to refill my produce or get a coffee in a nice atmosphere I make a quick visit. At night sometimes they play some fun music like Michael Jackson, Billy Joel, or any number of 80's Pop Gems. It's got a sweet vibe and most patrons are legit neighbs. Rarely do I see sketchy crims migrate from the Circle K on Ash. But if l do see them, invariably they are gettin' a 40 from Topps or lookin' for a chill nap behind the pizza store.","My family and I were headed to Pittsburgh on March 29 for the Penguins game. My dad decided to leave a few hours earlier (two hour trip), so we could go walk the Strip because  none of us had never gotten the chance to walk it. My dad had been mentioning how much he was craving pizza on the way down. I'd mentioned Bella Notte because I'd seen good reviews on it. So we decided to go in. Mom and Dad ordered a Grande, half pepperoni and mushroom and half hot pepper and pepperoni. We all had some. It was absolutely delicious. I'm not much for overly saucy pizza but I didn't mind it here because the sauce was so yummy. The crust was without a doubt the best part of the pizza. It was the perfect texture and flavor for my taste and taste of the family also. We all came to the conclusion the pizza was among the best we've ever had. Brother ordered pepperoni rolls. They were also delectable and unlike any other pepperoni rolls I've ever had, so crisp, spicy and oh-so-good. I hate to end this review on a semi-negative note, but I must mention it. I ordered a grilled chicken salad with light Italian dressing. The salad and dressing overall was good, but nothing special. The chicken was very dry and disappointing. Overall I will totally return next time I'm at the Strip, but instead of the salad, I'll skip right to the delicious pizza and pepperoni rolls.","Great food and great atmosphere. Was a little disappointed about how many things were missing from the menu (fruit cup, pizzas, etc) but the Gouda garlic Berger and the beet salad were amazing. Loved the out door area and walking through the garden.","3 1/2 stars. . First things first, the pizza is delicious. The crust is a perfect thickness with a slight chew. The sauce was flavorful. Very good. Reheated just as tasty the following days too. . This place is cute! A neighborhood bar vibe with friendly service. Great for the whole family. . We also had a Caesar salad, baked minestrone soup and fries. The fries were perfection. Extra hot and crispy. Delicious! They were free with a yelp check in. The Caesar was overdressed, but lots of leafy green romaine instead of all the yucky ribs. Minestrone was extremely hearty and loaded with fresh croutons, cheese, and pasta. The CUP could easily make a meal. . They serve breadsticks with marinara as a starter. They were cold and unimpressive. . Was a great choice for a chill dinner on Friday night. Big menu with loads of pasta, subs, apps, salads etc. . We will be back for the pizza! No doubt!! . Hubs had a giant beer. Grand total $37 with leftovers to spare.","In town for Spring Training (ST) and we saw a billboard for this place at the Tempe Stadium. We talked to a group of locals who said it was worth a visit so we went over our last night. Wish we'd tried it sooner!. It is primarily a bar and has a bar like feeling to it. It's noisy but not in an obtrusive way. Pretty uncrowded on a Monday night and we were seated immediately. The menu has appetizers, salads, pizzas and burgers. The pizzas range from like 12 to 21 dollars and are thin crust, plenty of food for two. We had an appetizer and split a pizza and had left overs. The crust is thin and crisp and there are plenty of toppings. I know the pizza is advertised as having a sourdough crust but I really couldn't taste it. The sauce had a nice tang to it and they were generous with toppings. I had the fried cheese curd appetizer and they were tasty and piping hot. Decent beer selection.    . For 1 pizza, 1 appetizer, 1 beer, and an iced tea, it was $40 after tax and tip. Enjoyed the food and atmosphere, we'll be back next time we're in town for ST.","This is such a cute hole in the wall located in the art district. I would definitely recommend making reservations. My friends and I were sat at the bar which we didn't mind and were greeted by a friendly bartender. He made me an amazing mock tail, while my friends indulged on what looked like some pretty good hand crafted cocktails. We split a salad a pasta and pizza and I was surprised how full I was. Everything is made is house, which is always nice. They have outdoor seating in the front and in the back. I will be coming back for sure when I'm in town. Keep up the great work guys !","Yesterday was my second visit to Paramount Fine Foods. I was with 5 friends and we arrived early (11:30 a. m. ) on a Wednesday. We were seated promptly and handed menus. Freshly baked pita was delivered to our table shortly thereafter. We sat with our menus for quite some time until we realized we were supposed to go up to the counter to order. No one mentioned this to us and I had honestly forgotten since I hadn't been there in about a year. We were told that since we were all seated at the same table, we all had to pay at the same cashier, which seemed a little silly, but whatever. . . . I ordered the Greek salad with 2 appetizer falafel balls on the side. The salad was quite good, if a little overdressed. It had plenty of feta cheese and 5 Kalamata olives. The falafel were really great. They were crispy and really tasty. No complaints there. . 3 of my friends ordered the fattoush salad with chicken. They all complained that there was FAR too much pita in the salad and that it was a bit greasy (the pita). They also said that their chicken was very overcooked and stringy. But they did say that the salad itself was quite tasty. . 1 friend ordered the butter chicken pizza. It came on a paper plate for some strange reason. Other than the terrible presentation, she really enjoyed her meal and said it tasted great. . Another friend ordered the chicken shawarma in a pita and said it was just great. She had no complaints. . All in all, the food wasn't bad, but also wasn't all that great. . The restaurant itself is really large, with a fairly large patio for extra seating. There is also a little play area for children. Even at 11:30 in the morning on a weekday, the place was quite busy and very loud. There were a lot of children running around and being quite rowdy. There was also extremely loud music blasting which made conversation a little difficult. . The prices aren't bad, although perhaps a little high for a restaurant where you have to line up at a counter to order your food (and pay first).","The food the Sports Deli does best on are the finger foods and sandwiches. The buffalo wings we just ordered were spot on. As good as any wings I've had. My preference is to get the wings dry with the sauce on the side, that way the wings will stay crispy longer. We also got the #8 Silver State (beef, pastrami, brisket, swiss) which was pretty good. It kind of reminded me of NYC deli's. . . yeah, that good!  Next time though I'm going to grab a bite of the #7 Boulder City (pastrami, fried egg, bacon, cheddar). . . a recipe to clog my arteries even more. You're going down #7!. . . inside my stomach, that is, next time I'm near the Sports Deli. . The pizzas and burgers are just OK.  Not worth an attempt in my opinion, but then it again it's not my appetite or stomach. To each his own!  But I'll stick to the sandwiches and finger foods.","Good intentions but a little iffy on food and delivery. Went in later (11:15)  and food took 40 minutes to come out with four of us ordering. Fish tacos had good mix and wonderful presentation but fish was not fresh and had that almost bad do I trust smell. Fries were enjoyed by all very heavy on garlic wonderful for the garlic aficionado. Margarita pizza good and garlic with a good balance of spice beyond the garlic unfortunately covered up by a little to much cheese taste. (to much cheese for a flatbread with good intention). Tomato soup and cheese sandwich were pusillanimous sandwich did not live up to the small but well balanced tomato. Atmosphere very nice and staff overworked but accommodating with great toons. This seemed like a non Vegas like place and considering this is a Marriott the day may be better as this has a little Mormon flair inherent in the fabric.","Met my dad here for lunch. I like their food but it's on the pricey side so I don't eat at NYPD Pizza very much. We got the 6 count honey BBQ boneless wings for an appetizer. When they came out they looked like little meatballs. . . Kinda sad looking, but they tasted good. And we got 7. I liked the sauce. We got a large 18\" pizza, half pepperoni, half cheese. The pepperoni half was super greasy, but the cheese side was quite tasty. Good place, but like I said, not cheap.","After my negative experience at Barros pizza, Amy Barro contacted me and let me know that my experience was out of the norm and she put a credit on my account for a free pizza, motz sticks and cheesy bread. Because of her generosity I tried Barros again and was pleasantly surprised. . our pizza was delish, and the rest although still greasy was much better than our previous order. Thank you Amy for going out of your way to make a customer happy! We will most definitely order pizza from your establishment again.","I was surprised by this little unpresumptuous  pizza joint. I walked in at 10:20pm and asked the guy what they had late at night. He said everything. Anything I wanted. I ordered a pizza for carry out.  16\" large pepperoni $9. 75. He was very friendly. Asked me how my day was going. I asked about his and he said that \"every day he gets up he's blessed. \"   That's the kind of attitude I like!   When the pizza came out I asked for aomenparmesean to sprinkle on the top and he pulled out his container and said \"say when\". He told me that he makes pizza my way. Whatever I want. I asked for crushed red pepper, done!   He asked if I wanted some garlic. How could I not!? It's a good pizza. And I'm sober. Haha. Try this place. Yummmmm","This was the most disappointing restaurant experience I've had in a long time. Though I never ate at the former location in Bethel Park, I wrongly assumed that an established business would have good food and good service. . The very young hostess seated us right by the door on a day when it was 27 degrees outside. There were at least 10 empty tables where she could have seated us. She just wanted us to sit down so that she could go back to talking to her friend who was sitting at a nearby table. . There was a man who I gather is the owner seated at the table next to us who heard us talk about how cold it was. He even watched me put my coat on because it was THAT cold. He had a small space heater at his feet and enough meat on his bones so I assume he didn't notice that it was freezing. . I looked past that because I was so excited that the Pub and Pizza building was finally occupied again. We anxiously waited for our server to come and take our orders. We didn't wait too long. . The woman was friendly enough but when we asked what they have to drink, she said she didn't know because she doesn't have a list. We asked if they have beer and she said yes then proceeded to list off your standard dive bar drafts and a vanilla 'port. ' Um. . . Porter? . We ordered our drinks as well as a pizza and some provolone sticks. When the pizza came she put it on a wobbly pizza stand and dropped off the cheese sticks. The pizza stand was so wobbly I thought the pizza may slide off. . The food didn't look good. The cheese sticks weren't browned. They were sad, skinny sticks that were taken out of the freezer and dropped in the fryer. I've had better cheese sticks in a cafeteria. . As for the pizza, it was terrible. Soggy and shiny - two things that food should not be. I'm sorry but if you have 'pizza' in your name, you should at least have a decent pie. It's laughable considering all of the good pizza in a 2 mile radius of the joint. . We finished what we could and wanted to leave but our server disappeared. I went to the bar to ask if we could cash out. The bartender looked at me as if I were an alien. The owner rolled his eyes. He didn't even seem to care that his employees was. weren't taking very good care of his customers. . Rather than cash me out, the bartender went to find the server. Another 5 minutes went by and she came back to take our card. . All in all it was a bad experience. By the time we left we felt like the place didn't want customers. It's sad because they are in a good location. They won't last long unless they do huge business selling bud light and karaoke.","Worth the wait! Its probably not a good place for a first date, because you can expect to wait about 45 minutes to an hour to get a table, and another 30 to 45 minutes for your food (if you get their Chicago style crust) however, it is totally worth it if you enjoy the company of those you go with. Their pizza is wonderful, and a trip to Oregano's is simply incomplete without a pizzoki. If you enjoy drinks, their peach belini is great as well. I've never had something from Oregano's that I wouldn't advise someone else to order.","First off- weird configuration with choppy separation of games and dining. I like Dave &amp; Busters where it's all more incorporated so parents can sit and still be in same room with kids while they play and we can enjoy food and cocktails. So instead, I followed the kids around, lugging all the winter coats and hats. . After blowing $80 myself and another $100 with friends, we finally went to eat and ordered a bunch of pizzas. They tasted more like frozen tombstone pizzas but bigger than I though based on yelp reviews. The problem was service. Other than taking the initial order and dropping food, we NEVER saw our waitress. I had to literally walk around the dining room on three occasions flagging down OTHER waitresses for extra plates, drink refills, etc.  the dining area was NOT full. Each server had maybe a maximum of 3 tables to serve.  . 3 hours after being served and then after 20 minutes trying to hunt down our bill, I finally was fed up. I saw three managers in a corner and approached them and told them what happened and asked for the bill. Meanwhile, others in my party asked another waitress for my bill, who then found our waitress, who dropped it off. We sat there, with credit card in the bill sleeve and again, waited and no one came to pick it up. So I walked the bill and credit card to the manager myself. The manager (Heather maybe) was on it. She apologized profusely and said she understaffed the dining room. I've waitressed before and if a server can't handle 3 tables, they need better servers. Without us asking, the manager comped the ENTIRE meal and gave us free 1 hour play cards.  . While the experience was frustrating- I would go back simply because management responded so well. I felt bad too, thinking of leaving a tip for the server- not huge but something. But I saw her talking to the manager and looking at our table and throwing her arms in the air in disgust and then storming off. That just really turned me off. She never apologized for any delay. Not sure if right or not, and might get a lot of flak but I really don't reward bad servers. We were a table full of hungry people and we sat with empty plates, etc. for. a long time. That server really missed the opportunity to sell us a salad, some wings and dessert. But she never checked in on us. . We will return and try the restaurant again simply to support the business and hope they fix their kinks. And if we get decent service, we will tip appropriately. But I hope they work this out- it could've been a great locals addition to Town Square.","I love love love the Bread Co. Their cheese fondue with veggies, bread, and potatoes is not only delicious, but it's not a dish many other restaurants offer. The red sangria with fresh fruit is so refreshing and is just sweet enough. I also have have the strawberry and house salads. Both are very light, but tasty. The pizza is always great, and big enough to share with one or two other people. My favorite entree though, is the bolognese pasta. The portion is pretty big and the sauce is deliciously homemade. There are two things that bug me about this place though, the decor/ atmosphere comes across and so dirty and dingy. I have never heard anyone say that they appreciate the variety of chairs in the restaurant, and most of them are too low for the tables and it makes for an uncomfortable meal. My second grievance with Bread Co is the lack of flexibility in the lunch/ dinner meals they will make NO exceptions if you are there for lunch and want fondue they will not do it. I have also noticed a lack of consistency around certain dishes. Sometimes there is more / less cheese in the fondue. Sometimes the sangria is watery other times it's perfect. Can be hit or miss at times. Other than that, great, unique food.","Wondering for the first time in the Strip. Food smells made me remember it was lunch. So I popped in here. Good beer selection. Surprised to see Great Lakes beer being offered. Yes instead of bloody mary. Pizza that was coming out of kitchen looked good. So I had mom and dad meet here for some good pizza. It did no disappoint. Sure the order was pepperoni and sausage but we got sausage and pepperoncini. I still enjoyed the pie. Hate to say. East Coast pizza is just a little better.","I discovered this place 3 weeks ago and already have been back 5 times. Today, I had one of the best dishes of my life, Scallop/crab Benedict. It's simply out of this world tasty! The portions are generous, the staff is friendly and it has a homey feel. If I lived closer, I'd eat here every single day. So far, between my husband and I, we've had: margarita pizza, soft crab egg Benedict, lentil salad, a cheese board, lamb egg Benedict, Opera cake and honey lemon cake. Every single dish has been heavenly.","The worst pizza I've ever eaten! We were starving and ordered the Viva Las Vegas. I believe the Sopressata was rancid and picked it off. The crust was gooey and nasty. My bf loves meats and ate my pieces. The flavor of the meat permeated the cheese and I only ate some toppings so I had something in my tummy before attending a wine event! We left the event early as my bf started feeling Ill, nauseated by the time we got home and sick all night! I had much less discomfort which was 12 delay in the resulting surprise. . Worse than Chuck E Cheese!. The cheap beer is the only thing that should be ordered here!","the worst i mean the worst customer service. my brother came in here ordered two large pizzas for during their happy hour service, and instead of paying 12. 90 for them, he was charged full price $32. i came back with him and we told the cashier we wanted the happy hour price instead of the full price. got the money back, and returned 15 mins later to them having not even started our pizzas! don't catch us back here again.","As a Jersey girl, I've grown up being spoiled by NJ and NY classic pizza. Throughout my time in college in Pittsburgh, I've encountered my share of pizza restaurants that attempt to replicate this classic east coast taste but fall short. However, that is not the case with Benny's! The pizza is awesome, with slices that are the perfect thickness and have the optimal tomato sauce to cheese ratio. Additionally, the slices and pies are huge, with one slice as big as a person's head! Definitely filling. . Also convenient is that Benny's is open late on the weekends, which is helpful if you want a bite to eat after a night out with friends in South Side.","I'm a thin crust pizza person, but this pizza crust is perfect. It's not to thick or too thin. Their pizza sauce tastes homemade and they will make any kind of pizza you desire. Their delivery service is exceptional! Your pizza arrives hot and ready to eat.","Best pizza in the 'Burgh, hands down. Accept no substitutes, especially if it's right down the street. This is the place for perfect pie with slightly sweet sauce. . . dough that's thin yet doughy, abd the perfect amount of cheese and toppings.","Very poor customer service. I ordered food at 6:20 pm online my order didn't arrive so I called to see what was going on they said my order was cancelled because of the wrong number. Keep in mind it was placed off my sisters online account. They claimed they called and she said nobody ordered pizza but she's here with me. I said ok fine can I resubmit the order they said sure. 17 mins later I get a knock on the door and there is my pizza. The pizza was cold I told the driver it was ok take the pizza back and I would call and see if they can make my order fresh. I called in and the manager said oh well I can't give u a discount or anything because your number is wrong. That's the least you could have done. Poor customer service at best please do not order from this location!!","Great place if you want to pay $13 for what tastes and looks like a frozen pizza. Ordered the house salad with lemon vinaigrette which was way too sour and cheesy garlic bread which was decent considering we were starving. Then our pizza came, a simple thin crust pepperoni pizza, which looked and tasted like a frozen pizza. It was served on cardboard. . . would not recommend and will never be returning.","I wasn't impressed. I ordered online. They called me to tell me they were all out of sweet chili sauce I wanted on my wings. Delivery took 20 minutes more than the time it showed online, and the pizza was not fresh. When I order dominos, the pizza is always hot and fresh when It gets here. That is funny because Pizza Hut is way closer to my apartment than dominoes. Surprisingly though, the wings that I got instead, garlic Parmesan, ended up being my favorite.","I've passed this place so many times, but my wife and I finally decided to stop in for a late dinner on Wednesday. I am beyond happy the food and experience.  . Service:  (5. 0)  They hit it out of the park for me. The hostess was very nice and quickly informed us about the restaurant week menu, the later-night happy hour menu, and the regular menu (we had plenty of options). We at ate the bar and the service was great and friendly. Our bartender was knowledgeable about the menu and the drinks. We had to quiz her on a few menu items to narrow down our choices and she knew everything by memory. She also didn't try to upsell us at all, which was nice. She was also great to talk with and a fun person in general. . Ambiance: (4. 0)  It's an understated joint with dim lighting. Nothing special, but certainly not off putting. I could see it working for a romantic dinner or a casual meal with friends or family. . Menu: (2. 0)  I'm giving it a low rating because the main menu is just too big.  the food on the menu is great, but the size is overwhelming. The happy hour menu at the bar is short, but it focuses on a few good items such as a crudo sampler, a delicious sausage pizza, a burger, mussels, and a couple other items. It's really just the standard fare most modern Cleveland restaurants serve, but $5 an item is a solid deal. The regular menu, as noted, is way too big. Even so, everything on the menu sounded great and we ultimately selected a mix of menu and happy hour items: the crudo sampler, sausage pizza, tongue and eggplant caponata, and garganelli with sweetbreads and gizzards.  . Food:  (3. 5 overall) Delicious!!  . The crudo sampler (2. 0) was the weakest of the bunch. It consisted of: scallops with tobiko, scallions and lemon zest; yellowtail with pesto and tomatoes; tuna with lardo; and salmon with orange, fennel, red onion and fennel pollen.  the scallop and the tuna with lardo were both perfect. The yellowtail and salmon both seemed too fishy for something that should have a very clean flavor, IMO.  Even so, the combinations of flavors in each crudo item worked well. . The tounge dish (4. 0)  incorporates a sweet and sour eggplant caponata. Don't read \"sweet and sour\" as some sort of Asian influence. The caponata is actually somewhat traditional and rustic, but the slices of tongue elevate the dish a bit. The tongue was perfectly cooked and it had a great rendered fat mouthfeel that went well with the eggplant. The dish lacks a bit of color, but the flavor and textures more than makes up for it.  . The garganelli pasta (5. 0) contains sweetbreads, giblets, radicchio, butter, parmesan and breadcrumbs (real breadcrumbs, not some canned junk). First, the pasta was excellent. This wasn't some dried pasta pulled from the store shelf. This is fresh pasta made with care and skill. Chinato does make their pasta in house, but they don't have an extruder to make things like garganelli and fusilli. Now, I love Ohio City Pasta, but they didn't get this from Ohio City Pasta. Whoever made their extruded pasta put an artisan touch in the recipe. The rest of the dish was equally impressive. The giblets had just the right amount of give in the bite and the sweebreads were cooked to perfection. I was worried that the bitter radicchio and the butter parmesan might overpower the sweetbreatds, but that wasn't the case at all. Everything was in perfect balance. I was happily surprised by the salt level in this dish. Rustic Italian food tends to use a bit more salt than one might expect. This dish kept with that salted tradition, which I liked. A heavy hand of salt in some food can be a terrible experience, but not with this dish. . The Sausage Pizza was also great (3. 5). The crust was thin and a little crispy, with a great char. I would compare it to a Neapolitan-style pizza, but with a bit more chew to the crust. However, this isn't some artisan pizza from a wood-fire oven. The sauce was simple and let the tomato flavor shine, the mozzarella was of a good quality, the were conservative with the cheese, and the sausage seemed fresh and crumbled to the perfect size. The crust actually had a good bread flavor too--many pizza makers don't put much thought into the flavor of their dough. It is a light crust and it's pizza in a more proper/traditional form; don't expect to get delivery-style pizza here.  . Overall, I say it was a 3. 5 to a 4-star experience (I'm leaning towards 4). Had the crudo been better, it would be a 4. 5 to 5-star dinner. This place has a lot of Zack Bruell hype, but I think it actually lives up to that hype. I'll certainly go back to see if we get a repeat experience.","I've had better pizza but it's quaint and good place to eat when you are visit the Linq or going on The High Roller.","I can't believe I'm rating this place a 4, but I left here feeling very satisfied, at least in terms of their chicken bites. . I won't speak in terms of their pizza as I didn't order them here. However their chicken bites are made fresh, only to be fried and baked after you order. Therefore it will be a bit of a wait, however I can tell you it was well worth it. The blue cheese sauce I added on top of that was even better, especially since it cools down the hot bites after you initially bite on them. . Located at the corner of Danforth and Woodbine, this Pizza Pizza is easily accessible by subway. A busy area too I find, and they do have good business, considering I arrived at around 3:30pm.","Very good place to come! We were not sure if they accommodate children when we came, but they were very accommodating. Not much of a children's menu, but pizza is pretty universal. Brought us the wrong beer but it was still good. Will come back again! Steel pan pizza is amazing FYI!","Such a great and friendly place! Upon arriving I was greeted with a smile by an older gentleman who I learned was from the east coast and had an hysterical sense of humor. Being from the east coast myself we got to talking about pizza and bagels while waiting for my prescription to refill, which only took minutes, and he talked about his family and why he moved out here. . . overall it was a very great experience run by the man and one other assistant! Next time you go bring them some pizza, will ya? ;)","Oh Gus'. You are the stable of many a ASU student's diet. And for that, I thank you. . Gus has a good selection of Pizza, Subs, and Wings. They are very reasonably priced, and they have some fantastic lunch specials. . If you are in the mood for Pizza, then their best deal, by far, is their Lunch Pizza Special. This can only be ordered in person, or over the phone, so do not try to do this on their online ordering. . Gus' serves a 1 topping Large Pizza for $4. 99. That's right. A pizza that is actually made to order, not sitting in a hot plate over at Little Ceasers. A full-blown pizza for just $4. 99. And this baby can feed plenty!  I have only once been able to split it among three people. . . And we were all starving at the beginning.  . I would also recommend their Garlic Knots. . . These breadsticks-gone-twisted are covered in luscious garlic spread and parmesan cheese. A must-have for those who love all things bread related. . The one downside is that it is fast food. Shocking, right?!  This place does not have the highest quality food. . . But that is what you get when you aren't paying tons of money. . If you are looking for some decent pizza that will not empty your wallet, give Gus' a call.","I stopped by here this past weekend with my girlfriend for dinner. We got there around 6 pm on a Saturday and walked right in and ordered the eye opener plain, an 18 inch pizza. We were told that it would be about a 20 minute wait which was fine by us especially since the delivery times started out at around an hour when we got there and were up to an hour and half by the time we left. It was a Saturday night though and so I was not surprised. The restaurant itself was small but clean and looked like an old diner with what seemed like an old food bar in the middle of it and a couple of tables against the windows where we chose to sit. Within the 20 minutes we were told our pizza had come out and it looked good, albeit fairly greasy. As I think can be done with all pizzas, this one can be divided into its three major components : crust, sauce and cheese. The crust on this pizza was pretty good, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside when it mattered and cooked nicely. Next is the sauce which seemed to be ok but I honestly could not taste much of. That was probably due to the fact that there seemed to not be much of it on there although I know there was enough on the pizza  to cause the cheese to slide off the piece whenever it had cooled. Last up is the cheese which tasted nicely and of which there was a ton. All in all a satisfying pizza that I enjoyed. . The bottom line for me is that I would head back in the future if I was in the area. The pizza was reasonably price, tasted good and had what seemed like a mountain of cheese on that I thoroughly enjoyed.","We got a flyer on our door a couple of days ago. All the times I've driven past this place, there has never seemed to be a large crowd in there so I always assumed the worst and maybe I was right because apparently it's \"Under New Management\" now. I finally succumbed to the picture of chilli cheese fries and went there yesterday to try it out. It wasn't teeming with people probably because it was close to shutting down. I got the chili cheese fries and a slice of pizza, still don't know what type of pizza it was. The lady in there was very friendly and conversational (got my stuff to go), unlike some of that customer service you get at some of these places nearby. The food is very reasonably priced, I paid less than $10 for something I would expect to pay $15 at a chain restaurant. The full size pizza prices seemed a bit high but after tasting the one slice which I bought, I would pay that in an instant. THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA I\"VE EVER HAD IN MY WHOLE LIFE!!! I thought Dominos had transformed the pizza industry with their new crust but I guess that's probably because I had never tasted the real thing. I guess it's like comparing a Whopper to a Bobby Flay burger, try it once and you'll understand what I mean!","This was a memorable experience and a new LV eatery to add to the list - the other two being Palace Station and the Cosmopolitan pizza joint. . I thoroughly enjoyed the combo which had BBQ kalbi, chicken and meat pancake. Sides complemented it well. Great flavors without any overpowering. . Service was quick and efficient. . Look forward to trying other dishes they offer. Solid.","Grimaldi's has one of the best perks for your birthday!. If you are on the email list, you will get an email a little before your birthday, which can be used before or after within a few days! It is essentially an $18 coupon for a large pizza! . This essentially gets you a large one topping, or a large white with garlic, and you pay for additional toppings or anything else above and beyond!. I enjoy Grimaldi's charcoal style ovens, which add a nice flavor to the super thin crust and toppings. The pepperoni and sausage combo was a bit on the greasy end, but a little grease is a good thing!  The white pizza is amazing, with chunks of garlic hiding in there!. Service was pretty slow during lunchtime at the bar. They only had one server for the entire bar area, AND she had tables in the dining area. Not a huge deal to me since I wasn't in a hurry that day, but keep it in mind in case this wasn't an \"off\" day for them. . I'll be back at some point, but for sure next year for my birthday!","3. 5 stars. Nice little place to get good pizza and Greek, albeit Americanized Greek (gyros pitas and salads, calamari, etc. ). Pizza is distinct from the rest. Garlicky, so if you like that you will love it. Crust is delicious. The penelope is my favorite, but will get just a cheese when I need a cheaper fix. They will only do small pizzas for dine-in. If you want large you have to take it to go. Really weird, so we rarely dine in. I'm close by so I've been here a lot and 95% of the time get a consistently good product. But the other 5% unfortunately puts it down a notch to 3 stars. It's a midtown landmark and the best pizza near Woodlea/Melrose. Room for improvement that would boost their score. (Previously mentioned comments, they close too early for a pizza place, got a pizza that was way too salty once, price on many items too high for the quality, some parking area too dark - might make some uncomfortable at night. )","Went today. One of my fav chains I know I can count on. Today my BBQ Chicken Pizza was of course, delish as always. And their ceasar salad is always good too. I must tell you that they have a new honey wheat crust, DO NOT GET IT! I didnt know it was new and when my pizza came I kept biting down on something \"hard\". So when our Awesome waitress came by to see how our food was, I questioned if it was the \"honey wheat crust, bc my pizza didnt taste like \"normal\", she said yes but we did get a new honey crust that people are not liking :) She offered to replace my pizza and I said no thats ok. Which is out of the norm for me, she pretty much twisted my arm into having it replaced and Im glad I did. So I left once again, very pleased. Also, I would go here for curbside somewhat regularly but I have decided its a bit pricey for carry out, so its no longer on my carry out list. . ** One last note, The last few times, prior to this visit when we walked in smelled of \"rotten eggs\", maybe a sewer issue? And we refused to stay. We are pleased to announce the smell wasnt there and we can finally go as often as we like. Thumbs up to CPK!!","Five50 Pizza was perfect for a casual weeknight dinner with a family member that was staying at The Aria. Five50 has a grab and go counter where pizza is sold by the slice and then a dining room for a sit down meal. We chose to go with sit down service. . The Mozzarella Bar immediately appealed to me so we started with that as an appetizer. The three of us shared Buffalo Mozzarella, Burrata, and Chorizo Rioja. Along with our selections were bread, a nice stone ground mustard, candied nuts, and pickled vegetables. Everything on the plate was delicious. The chorizo was tasty and obviously a nice quality meat. The Mozzarella was my favorite of the cheeses, but the Burrata was nice and creamy. My only suggestion might be more bread to go with all of the cheese and accompaniments. . The Gotham Pizza was delicious. The crust had a nice crisp and the crust was just thick enough to hold the meaty toppings. The cheese on the pizza had a nice flavor. We found the one pizza in addition to the starter was plenty of food for three to share. My uncle and my husband also ordered shakes that they seemed to enjoy.","We just had our daughter's 6th birthday at Kangamoo and I felt I needed to write a second review. I can honestly say that it was the best birthday party I have been to, and with three girls we attend a lot of birthday parties. We reserved a private party, but they have open play parties as well. . We arrived about an hour early to set up and drop off supplies but quickly found that it wasn't necessary to arrive so early. A staff member (Mercedes) quickly jumped in to help us unload the car and situate the party room. At 5pm, the other guests left as Kangamoo closed and the staff helped us set up a table in the main area for the food. Immediately we put out the veggie and fruit trays and the drinks for the kids. . As the guests started arriving, Kangamoo staff members greeted them and helped get them signed in. The staff also took the presents and arranged them neatly on a side table (just one more thing not to have to worry about). One of the best things about this birthday party from a parent's perspective is that I didn't have to worry about guiding and dictating a schedule. The kids played in the play area for the first hour while the adults mingled in the front. Some were enjoying the massage chairs, others were painting their nails with their daughters. . About 15 minutes into the festivities, Moana came in. This Moana was a spot-on character and knew every line from the movie. Instantly the kids were enthralled with her. They played games and Moana led them on adventures in the play area for about an hour. She sang songs and danced with the kids and before she left, she sang happy birthday to the birthday girl and signed a personalized autograph to each child in attendance. Kangamoo arranged for Moana to be there as part of the package so we didn't have to worry about scheduling. . We provided pizzas before the cake and the staff helped arrange the food service. With the openness of the playground, there was plenty of room for us to eat and relax up front while the kids had fun. After things were winding down, the staff helped us graciously pass out gift bags to the kids leaving and then load up our car with all the left overs and presents. We didn't have to worry about cleaning up and were able to get our girls home right on time. They were so tired from playing, that they passed out early which gave us some much-needed adult time this evening. Thank you, Mimi, Shawn and the entire Kangamoo staff for the best birthday party ever.","I've gone there twice, once when it first opened then again tonight. Both times extreemly disappointed. I only went back to give it another shot since I was hopping for my first night going was just an off night. I was wrong. The pizza honestly was gross. It was cold, dough is heavy and flavorless,  sauce was watered down, pepperoni was bad quality and the cheese was actually the only good part. . We unfortunately left half of it and fed it to the birds outside lol. . I wouldn't recommend this place truthfully at all. . Worst part was the owner gave my pizza to another costumer by accident and made me wait another 15 minutes to make and other one.","Today was an opportunity for Pizza Fire to shine or it would be our last visit. We had free pizza coupons due to lousy service on our last visit. Not much has changed except for the prices and the menu. Coupon stated unlimited toppings. I found out that fresh mozzarella was not a topping? So I paid the extra $, scratching my head \" if it's not a topping what could it be\"? Hey, I was getting a free pizza so $ wasn't a big deal. If you like soggy pizza you would have loved this one. My husband always orders the unlimited or build your own pizza. Nope, not any more it is off the menu. My husbands pizza was as soggy as mine. Ugh! They were a little more organized than past visits but the pizza needs to improve. Looks like Neapolitan Pizza in the strip mall in front of Costco gets my business with friendly organized staff and a nice crust.","I can't say that I'm a big lover of pizza but I don't dislike it either. I rarely go out of my way to order or eat pizza. This visit was no exception. I was getting home from work late and most of the fast food outlets near home were already closed so dropped in at Pizza Pizza. . They had whole variety of pizza slices on display, reheated to order. They looked good but I still wasn't quite feeling it. I ended up ordering the Classic Chicken Wings (unbattered) to go, 10 wings for 9. 75. . They were still hot and crispy when I got home. I had opted for the Creamy Garlic dip but it wasn't really necessary. The chicken had minimal but just enough seasoning. Not bad. I'll try the crispy (battered) version next time.","I went to Sauce on Dec 28th to watch the football game. . Had a great time. . Ordered a pizza. The bartender Kamie was really nice. Fun to hang out with, Took great care of me while I Was there. Got my food out quick. . Had a great time!!","There seems to be an abundance of good pizza in Las Vegas, but Mark Rich's pizza comes with a flavor and personality that makes it seem home-made. Maybe it's the family atmosphere of the restaurant, or the savory flavors packed into the stromboli. . . . or perhaps it is just the fresh ingredients that they put on the plate. . . whatever their secret, the food is good and reasonably priced and this spot is well worth the visit.","It's an amazing late night or end of your night place to grab a slice of pizza. That's how I came across this place at 1:30am. The pizza are throw into an oven to warm up or create your own. They also have sets to order from jn you want to dine in but late night crawlers can grab a slice by the entrance by 2:00am - they have slices of the set and picked through the glass. Located near the sports bar / poker room. Easily way to stag a slice a pizza and get back to what is more important in some cases. The pizza was good for the price but try to avoid the one with a lot of cheese, it was to much cheese for me - unless u like cheese","I had carry out from this place, so don't really know how good the service is. It's a neighborhood pizza place with a wood oven and decent bar. The pizzas have good crust, not too burned but i prefer that. The toppings were all good quality. Some of them were put on after the crust was in the oven, which is fine -- the quality was good. They also have a decent looking bar with what looked like 5 local brews on tap - I believe it was three amsterdams, a local IPA, and something else. The space is pretty good too. I'd like to eat in next time.","Ordered this after 12 midnight. Asked for pepperoni with extra sauce and chicken fingers. The order was expected to be delivered in 45 min, it took 15. That was the only positive part of our experience. The fingers were dry and burnt. . . I mean black on one side, not just overcooked. The pizza is horrible. Barely any toppings, spongy crust. I will never order from them again. Disgusting. Not worth it,","Service was good but pizza was awful. . . dry, scant toppings &amp; it took forever to arrive. I'm missing Nello's already.","I love trying different pizzas with the hope of finding the perfect pie. While in Phoenix, Oregano's was recommended to us by some locals so we thought we would try it. It must be popular because when we arrived on Saturday evening there was a wait of well over one hour. Frustrating, and not really their fault. In fact, they were good with passing out some pizza samples and getting people drinks. Once we got in, we tried a Chicago deep dish pizza. It is very filling and overall not bad, even with a distinct oregano enhanced flavor. But, the pizza was overwhelmed with pizza sauce, and the crust was not entirely cooked in places. Despite aIl this it was worth the trip and discovery, but I'm not sure I'd endure the wait again.","Lazio buns anyone ?? . Lazio is hands down the best bakery in Sauga for the freshest, softest buns AND cannoli's! Like WOW! Those were my exact words after ordering buns from them for Christmas and Easter. Their cannoli's are heavenly. Always fresh and have the crunch* on the shell. Aside from the bread area they also have a good hot table and deli section. Their coffee is also great! . Their hot table and pizza are good, not the best but not bad. Molisana bakery has a way better hot table and the best pizza for sure! But I eat it still when I'm hungry and in the area. So bottom line if you need buns and cannoli's COME HERE! You won't regret it.","I forgot why I haven't ordered from here in years. Now I remember after todays carryout. Watered down marinara. Dry breadsticks. Undercooked pizza. And messed up order (they forgot one of my toppings - bacon). See photo. I didn't call them  to rectify the problem, they'd probably give me the run around for their mistake and having to wait for my correct order, yeah, no, I was too starved to wait. Papa makes better pizza. Always papa from now on.","My husband is from NY, so he knows his pizza! We go here for their NY-style pizza. It's thin wide slices with a little sauce and cheese. We love it! When we're out and about on McKnight we'll come here often for a quick meal. It reminds us of our favorite pizza shop up in NY called Mia's. . Because we like the pizza so much, we haven't tried anything else they offer, but it's pretty standard pizza shop stuff.","This place has amazing food. We always come here whenever we crave pizza or Italian food. Their Alaskan King Crab pizza is to die for. They are sooo good. And their appetizers are great as well. The atmosphere around here is nice as well. They have good seating and also a bar too if you'd like to drink.","My friend suggested we try this new pizza place in the Hilton Shopping Center on Scottsdale Rd. for our regular Sunday night dinner. I love trying new restaurants, and so off we went. Upon entering, we saw a cute restaurant with a great indoor/outdoor bar, plenty of outdoor seating and inside tables with comfortable chairs. . The appetizers (green beans with mustard and crispy french fries) were delicious, the chopped salad was refreshing, but nothing to write home about, and we ordered three pizzas (margharita, pepperoni, and shrimp)  All were yummy, toppings were good, dough was great, but I felt like they skimped a little with the toppings. The crust was very wide and so I felt like half the pizza was more like a bread stick. . I would go back again, but maybe only for happy hour (half price wines and beers, maybe some appetizers) but felt for the dinner price, the pizza didn't live up to my desires.","Okay, so the pizza here is good enough to give 5, (hell I'd give 6!!) stars even though they don't have the fastest service &amp; LITERALLY up charge, even when your substituting out a meat for NOTHING. Last time we said \"no sausage\" &amp; they charged $1. It's only $1, and it's SO EF-N good so who cares right??!?!! Oh, &amp; good it is. . . dayyyemmm it's so \"east coast rare\" &amp; delicious. It's totally worth it. Waited 35 minutes today for a carry out order (was told 15-20minutes). Was charged extra to sub out a meat &amp; all we said was, \"instead of sausage, could you just put on the cheese\". . . It's totally okay though because the pizza is THAT DAMN GOOD!! SO, if they run late, or overcharge, just deal. . . because it's IMPOSSIBLE to find such an east coast, NYC, (I'm talking about Lambardies on Spring St. ) style pizza in AZ.","Caliente's is the best pizza I've had in town. Maybe not as celebrated as some others, but you get a great pie here. The wings are very good too. Subs are just meh, but hopefully that's not why you've come to a place with \"Pizza\" in the title.","One of my favs tucked in a strip center off Power and McDowell. Open grill cooking area, great bar area along with indoor and outdoor seating. When temp residents are back for winter it is packed. . . although it is busy all the time. Worth the visit or take out (especially the pizza). It is a hot spot for this part of Mesa. Always good and consistent.","This place just opened today!  I tried the brick oven pizza and was blown away!  If you are tired of all the chain restaurants in Monroeville, you need to try this out. The food prices are amazing and the quality is top notch. We had very fast and friendly service. but please do yourself a favor and try the pizza. . . . Nothing close to it in the area. . . . . . . . .","Best pizza in the valley!  They make everything in house - the crust, the sauce, even the cheese!  We usually start with the Mediterranean Salad which has crisp lettuce, feta cheese crumbles, black olives in a really light vinaigrette - it's huge and so good!  Then we always get a large pepperoni and onion pizza - so good we haven't been able to try anything else. Go try it!  You won't be disappointed.","First the good: The food is generally tasty if a bit overpriced and smallish in portions. I have enjoyed the happy hour pizzas for years. Sadly, I now have to steer folks away from this place, due to some highly unsavory practices. . Towards the end of our evening at Cibo, we were informed that because there were a little over 30 people in our party, the minimum bill would be $3500. That's over $100 per person!  For a meal we had pre-ordered at around $50/plate. The time to mention this ridiculous minimum would have been when the reservation and orders were made. Not after the third course. . The minimum charge was reduced to $2000 (thanks!), but even with the hundreds of dollars in wine and drinks added, we didn't reach it, and each person had an extra $12 surcharge applied to their bill. Now, the service was good enough, and the added %20 tip expected, so I don't blame the servers because they clearly weren't getting any of the money the restaurant was effectively stealing from their captive diners.  30 people x $12 (pre-tax, pre-tip) = $360 of free money for the restaurant. They didn't even offer any extra food or drinks.  $12 isn't the end of the world for me, but I would be writing a different (still critical, but less so) review had I gone home with a $12 slice of cake or something. But this was simply robbery. As unethical as I have seen in a restaurant. . We asked to speak with management and were denied. In the end, we paid the absurd \"fine\" and I now have to say goodbye to a once decent neighborhood restaurant. If you treat your clientele reasonably, they will support you through the tough times. But if you screw them over, they will turn on you. I see a bleak future for Cibo and the other restaurants in this chain. . *** Updated December 15, 2018 ***. I'm pleased to say that management, after reviewing communications between our party and Cibo staff, has adequately rectified what turned out to be an unfortunate case of miscommunication. They did so with graciousness and professionalism. I'm still a fan, and I'll be back. The food really is good!","I always like supporting a small, family-run business, but this place makes it easy to do that. The pizza is delicious!  Highly recommend!","I have heard about the O since before I moved to Pittsburgh and finally tried it last week. It was exactly as I expected it would be in terms of menu and \"decor\". I was, however, impressed with the wide variety of options available on their menu. Yes, they had the standard hot dog options, pizzas, subs and hoagies. What was nice is that each different type of food was ordered and prepared in a separate area, so lines moved quickly. We stuck with the hot dog section and each had a hot dog, got one order of fries and an order of chicken fingers. When they tell you a small order of fries serves two, they aren't kidding. The basket was overflowing with perfectly seasoned fries with just the right amount of crisp.  . I have come to the conclusion that I prefer the standard \"not sure what is actually in it\" hot dog taste to that of the all beef, high quality dogs. Not a knock against the O, it just made me enjoy my fries and chicken fingers more than the hot dog itself. I did, however, love the chicken fingers. Great flavor, moist and just the right amount of breading. The downside for this Buffalonian is that they do not have blue cheese, so I just dipped them in hot sauce instead.  . I had no idea that the O served alcohol, so it was a surprise to see not only a selection of tap beers, but also a cooler that wrapped around the restaurant with everything from Boones Farm to high end microbrews.  . I'm glad I went and experienced their \"famous\" fries and enjoyed my food and experience. However, I probably won't be back until the next time I am really craving greasy, late night type food.","Classic old school pizzas shop. This type of authenticity is extremely rare these days. I've been eating at Rosa's since the early 80s and it as good as it's always been. Great place. Great people. Highly recommend","I love the seafood linguine. I prefer the on one their menu over the special version since their special costs $10 more for a couple pieces of lobster and I like a tomato sauce more than a ros\u00e9. I was not a huge fan of their spaghetti bolognese. Most of my co-workers liked their pizza.","Best pizza in stow! The grinders are super good too!","The pretzel app was great, salad good, but the pizza is completely lacking. The sauce is basically tomato paste.","We tried the new location in Anthem this past Friday. Friends of ours that live out there told us about it, and we were excited to give it a try. . We went somewhat early to avoid the crowds/rush, and left impressed and wanting to come back. . We arrived, and were greeted by one of the owners, explained we were first timers, she was very friendly and welcoming, and made us feel right at home. The young Lady that took our order was also friendly, patient, and helped walk us through the process since it was our first time.  . We ordered a large house salad, a regular order of garlic knots, and a 20\" cheese pizza. The salads are in a cooler by the drink station, and are already made. Since it was our first time, the young Lady that took our order grabbed it and the dressing for us while we grabbed a table and got ourselves situated.  . I was a little concerned that the salad was pre-made and waiting in a cooler, but this was not a problem. While fairly basic with a romaine mix, some green bell pepper, tomato, and some cucumber; everything was fresh, crisp, and cold. We chose the balsamic vinaigrette, and were happy with our choice. The dressing had that nice balsamic flavor, but it wasn't overwhelming. . Next up was the garlic knots, and they were very good. We ordered a regular size, and receive 6 hot, fresh, chewy knots with a good amount of garlic. They didn't last long, GRP serves them with a side of marinara for dipping, which I thought was a nice touch. One word of warning, be careful opening the container of sauce, it is very hot (it was also very good, and went well with the knots). . Then came the \"pizza de resistance\" (sorry, couldn't help myself). My favorite meals are usually simple, well prepared foods with quality ingredients. This pizza fit that requirement nicely. The pizza came out and it looked and smelled wonderful. We all dug in and yes, it tasted as good as it looked and smelled!  The menu states that GRP uses \"whole milk Wisconsin mozzarella hand shredded each day for freshness\"; one taste, and I believe it. Fresh quality cheese stands out, and has a flavor/texture that \"pizza topping\" will never match. The sauce was very low key, but was plentiful and complimented the cheese and crust nicely. Oh, the crust. . . had the right amount of chewiness and the flavor that once again says quality ingredients matter. The only negative about this pizza (in my very humble opinion) was that there was a little too much crust at the outside edge. Luckily, the crust is light, tasty, and chewy the way it should be, so this doesn't really take anything away from a very good pizza. The 3 of us devoured that 20' pizza, and only took home a little over 1/2 a slice!. We enjoyed our visit to the new GRP, and can't wait to return; as a matter of fact, my wife wanted to go there for Mother's Day, but they were closed for the holiday.  . 4-4. 5 stars. Keep up the good work!","I was headed out in this direction and was looking for something quick for dinner. Looked up triple D locations and saw this place. My first impression was that I wonder if it's any good. My second impression was, I don't remember watching this on TV. Did not matter as it would have been a place to try anyway. . So before heading out we looked at the menu and wrote down what we wanted. We were driving from Phoenix and I didn't want to eat cold food. I called and placed the order and said it would be ready in about 10 minutes. Well when we drove up we were shocked to see a long line. . I went in trying to figure out what was going on. I saw the window that was for pick up and went is this where I pick up my order? It sure was. I was happy I called ahead and had paid for it in advance and was on my way. I saw the line for food and it was pretty long. I can't imagine the wait. . Finally at the destination we sat and ate. We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and onion rings that were featured on the show as well as a burger. The pizza was pretty good and the onion rings. The first thing that came to my mind was it reminded me of another place I went to that was featured on triple D. Taylor's Refresher in Napa. It has that sort of feel to it. . Over all it was good, but a long way to go just for food. If we're ever there again we'll place another take out order. Saves the wait time and just as fresh as waiting in lien for it to cook.","Note: This review is past due and it was for the time I visited during the month of March. . Incredibly slow service. There were only two people in the restaurant yet we got our god damn pizza 30 mins later. I was very furious. To top it off, there were only two tables that were occupied and 20 or something vacant ones. Anyways, we ordered the BBQ pizza and once we received it, our first bite into the pizza had BBQ sauce dripping everywhere my plate. That is because they basically downed the whole pizza in BBQ sauce. Me and my friend could not even finish the pizza because it was too drenched with BBQ sauce. However, the pig inside me still gobbled most of it since I do love BBQ pizza. . Seriously, I never want to give a place a one star, because unless they actually treated their customers like trash, that would be the underlying decision to give them a one star. They really need to work on their service because I can only imagine if they were actually busy. . . if they ever are.","The pizza wasn't that great at all and neither was the weird garlic bread. . Wouldn't recommend at all.","I had a great time at this hotel. I would return here for sure. First is the lobby. It's huge, remodeled, and unique. The bar outside near the pool is great and comfortable, but the best thing about it is their pizza. Sounds crazy, but it's the best pizza outside of New York. . The pool area is nice. They have very comfortable lounge chairs and it's quiet. You would never know that you are so close to downtown. I considered giving it four stars because  the rooms themselves (although plenty large with nice patios) are pretty plain. But the general manager is friendly and says that they are still updating the property. The bathrooms were beautiful and had great products, but I didn't get a chance to check out their spa. One last thing, when you get there, they give you one of those fireball candies that are almost impossible to eat, but fun to try.","With the number of customers filing through this restaurant, you are likely to get a fresh slice of pizza. They were turning over lots of customers around midday. I got a cheese slice and a slice of mushroom spinach. Both were decent for airport pizza. I'd visit again.","Really great space on two levels with the upper level overlooking the Capitol, creative drinks (after all, it is from the folks at Merchant), and a good vibe. . Tried the deep-dish Detroit-style pizza. Was pretty decent, but could have been a lot better in a couple ways. The cheese, toppings, and crust were great, but the addition of the caramelized cheddar around the edges was not a hit for me. It ended up having a weird burnt, salty, off taste to it. Also, the sauce suffered from being garlicy and somewhat bitter. A brighter, slightly sweeter sauce would have been perfect. Fixing both of these things would definitely add a star, but I'll definitely be back to try the wood-fired pizza.","Wolfman was my go-to pizza place when I lived down the street from it in Charlotte. Consistently good pizza. . Likes:  Their \"Pizza of the Month\" special is awesome. As a poor grad student, I would order one of the $5 10\" pizzas, pair it with a salad made at home, and get two meals out of it. Scoreeee. They also have more unique flavor combinations than you usually see: black beans on a pizza? I like pizza and I like black beans, so sounds good to me.  . Dislikes:  The pizzas can be pricey if you arent in the mood for the special. I've also gone to pick up my to-gos a few times and the pizza wasnt ready when they told me it would be.   . Take it or leave it:  Take it. Take advantage of the special. Awesome. I'm just sad that I didnt discover it  until a few months before I was moving away from Charlotte.","Great pizza and wings. The whole family loves this place. Be prepared to wait if calling for delivery, much much faster to call your order in and pick it up.","I had a mushroom and cheese pizza delivered. The mushrooms were cannd, which I actually prefer, and there were lots of them. The cheese was thick, not too greasy,  and not over seasoned. The sauce was decent, meaning nothing that stuck out to me as exceptionally bad or good,  but that is where any goodness ends. . I'm from ny and I've only have one pizza in ohio that had a passable crust. This was not it. . 1. Crust was covered in grease like PH. 2. There was not a lot on the edges of the pizza and what was was crispy or incredibly greasy. . 2. The crust below the pizza was thick and way too greasy.   . Overall a very poor showing. I will never go back","Ordered pizza from New York Pizza the other night, and I was quite satisfied. Pizzas are large - we ordered two larges for eight people and had plenty left over. The garlic knots were amazing (as everyone else has mentioned), and the pizza was tasty as well. We got the \"two larges with one topping each\" special for $25, as well as wings and garlic knots. Wings a little small and not anything special, but garlic knots were great. Only downside with the experience is that the delivery boy must have tilted the box when on his way here - pizzas were smooshed on one wall. Otherwise, perfect experience!","I would call myself an Italian food snob. I come from a large Italian family on the east coast. I love cooking Italian food and im very very good at it. so when i eat Italian food out i have high standers. SAUCE has met those standars. You can tell everything is freshly made on site. i had the Italian chimichanga OMG you have to try it. what a great fusion of Mexican and Italian. i also took a large cheese pizza to go for a late night snack for after the club. The pizza was awsome also. A chill casual place to have some good Italian food. I will be back,","A cute little restaurant with the smell of a wood burning fire. The wait staff were knowledgeable and friendly. My son's kid pizza was the same size as a regular pizza but a quarter the price, and delicious. I ordered the duck pappardella and enjoyed it. Steam whistle on tap and nice wine options. Garage doors were open bringing in the Queen Street atmosphere. . It's a family friendly restaurant, yummy and reasonable. Sunday's have no corkage at dinner too. I'll be back!","Restaurant review:. AYCE Chicago style pizza in Champaign, I couldn't pass up the chance to eat the pizza lunch buffet during the weekday. I quickly hopped into my car and jetted to this location for my lunch hour. I was surprised to find that there was plenty of seating in the restaurant. Staff was super friendly and I was off to the races to eat pizza. Now the \"Rush Street\" pizza bar is 8. 49 Monday to Friday 11AM to 1:30 PM. They give you a choice of salad or the two soups (tomato bliss or chicken green chili soup). I was took the tomato bliss, very rich tomato soup. I wish they had some cheese to go with it. I proceeded to gorge on the pizza selection and the calzone. My impression is that they don't have any deep dish pizzas which is unfortunate when you think chicago style pizza the deep dish is the cornerstone. Lots of other pizza selection from meat lover to veggies to hawaian. The calzones were prepared well. The pizza is super hot so let it cool down just a little bit before diving in. Overall the pizza is comparable to other restaurant quality pizza and a bit better than the chains (papa johns and pizza hut). They are not kidding when they tell you that this is for the rush hour lunch crowd. Before I finished my soup, the check was on the table in case I had to pay and run. Service was friendly. Also and FYI you can request pizza for the buffet. So all and all the pizza is relatively good quality, but missing a deep dish would have pushed it over the top. Finally the chocolate chip cookie is a bit too small and just a odd way to end the meal. You get just a small one. . . . Pro: AYCE lunch pizza buffet, better than papa john or pizza hut, super fast service. Cons: No deep dish pizza, if it is not busy you may have a very limited selection. There was 4 pizza types and the calzones and breadsticks. Hidden gem:. AYCE Lunch pizza buffet. For the pizza lovers","Our 1st time to go to Giordano's since the restaurant opened about a month ago. We arrived  at 4:30PM on late Sunday afternoon. As was expected there was a wait time of 30-40 minutes. We are from Chicago and have eaten at Giordano's several times and was excited to visit there new location in Arizona. Our pleasant surprise was we were seated within 10 minutes for a party of 2! Our server greeted us with a smile and apologized for the long wait. We ordered right away Giordano's fabulous deep dish pizza with sausage, mushroom, and green pepper and Greek salad with a pitcher of Sangria. Our server, Veronica was exceptional! She prepared us that in preparation of the pizza pie the wait time was about 45 minutes. No problem, as we knew anything worth waiting for is going to be worth it. Needless to say, the pitcher of Sangria arrived and Greek salad right away. That pitcher had to be 64oz easily, very modestly priced at $16. 50. Much better buy than paying for individual glasses. And then just as we were to receive the pizza, the general manager walked up to our table as said, \"You have be 21 to drink this\". My wife appreciated the humorous comment as we are in our early 60's. The General Manager, looked so familiar to us. And then it hit me. . . I know you! She then mentioned that we looked familiar as well. The General Manager spoke with us for a few minutes and quite honestly made us feel right at home there. The pizza well now that's another story! It was as expected, out of this world awesome!!! Thanks Veronica and GM. Giordano's has made me feel like I owned the place! Great job!!!!","Good deals, nice staff and cheap gas!  I was overcharged once, and the manager Dena Sexton looked into it personally. I love how it's never too crowded. You can shop in peace and know that the return policies are fair and no-hassle. Love this Sam's Club!  Oh and when the car wash doesn't get all the rain dirt off my car, they run my car through again no charge. This is what they should do, but it is nice to see a store take accountability for poor service. P. S.  you guys really need to replace the mechanical hardware in the car wash machines. I spend thousands a month at this place, without hesitation. Oh and the food in the food court is always nasty and prepared poorly. Burnt hot dogs, stale buns, dry pizza, stale pretzels.","NOT GOOD PIZZA. I can't hate them for making it cheap (that's why I went there), but it's probably the most bland excuse for pizza I've ever had. . . the first time I've ever been unenthusiastic about finishing leftover pizza. . Service was fine, and it was quick - it's just not very good food. If your only care is filling your stomach on $5, then this place is for you. If you are actually looking for something that tastes good, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. There are plenty of other pizza joints around that are a million times better.","I cannot say enough about Lupo, its staff and its fantastic food (hats off to you and your staff, Eduardo!) My man and I were fortunate enough to find this lovely place to hold b-day dinners for both his papa and one of my girls. In both cases, the food couldn't have been better (highly recommend their pizzas, the ravioli, the fettuccine con fungi, roasted halibut. . . . . really, you cannot go wrong!), the service was fantastic (the pre-printed menus we had designed were waiting in front of each place setting when the birthday boy/girl walked in. . . and no water (or wine) glass was ever half empty), and the atmosphere was ideal (if you are part of a larger party, I highly recommend asking for the high top table towards the back of the resto -- it's perfecto!) I cannot wait to throw another party there!! Thank you again, guys, for making the evenings so special!","Brak has been remiss in not reviewing Pizza Pit before now. We originally dined here on a Groupon last year, and loved it. But for no good reason other than it's not particularly close to home (though not a terrible haul either), we hadn't been back. I was recently reminded that it's a place we should visit again. We've now been back 3 times in the past few weeks, and I'm happy to report that Pizza Pit rates a SOLID 5 stars on the Brak-o-Meter. How so? It's not a chain, it's a family-run joint, and looks and feels like it. Lots of good TV's for catching whatever ballgame you're interested in watching. A unique style of pizza, named after Fred Garvin's stomping grounds, the quad cities area, located at the Iowa/Illinois boundary. It's a slightly thick crust with a unique texture that is difficult for me to describe, but I like it a lot. The toppings are placed under the cheese, and the pizza is strip-cut rather than pie-cut (though I'm sure they'd oblige a pie-cut request). Salads are bueno too, and there are sandwiches and stuff I haven't tried but I'm sure are good. . I just go straight for the pizza &amp; a small salad and I'm one happy creature. . If you like supporting local businesses that deliver solid value, friendly service, and a great and unique twist on the old favorite pizza pie, then do yourself a favor and give Pizza Pit a try. Brak is confident you'll be glad you did. It's now on the short list of Brak's regular rotation joints, even if it's a bit of a drive. Good stuff, Maynard!","By Pittsburgh pizzaria standards, this place is pretty great. The crust is thin and crispy (as pizza should be!), there is no sugary sweet taste to the sauce, and they do not automatically give you a side of ranch under the assumption that that is an acceptable way to eat pizza. It's also super cheap. Also, PIZZA BY THE SLICE! WIN!. They do tend to be inconsistent, as the single slices are never the same size from one visit to the next. One time, my slice was literally wet and soggy and inedible at the bottom. . When you want to spend under $5 on a (decent) meal, go here.","Lovely restaurant but ordered the \"lambretta\" pizza; prosciutto is main ingredient. . . . . disappointed to see the pizza only had a TINY few thin pieces of prosciutto on it when it was served. Very stingy. Also my friend ordered the same pizza and also was disappointed with the lack of prosciutto.","Scaddabush had a nice after work drinks/dinner atmosphere on the Friday night we went. They played top 40s during our dinner which was nice!  I went on a date here and it was incredibly loud upstairs near two parties. We asked to be moved to a quieter spot which the servers happily did - they moved us downstairs to a quieter booth. . Main Course:. Zucca Ravioli was great! I loved the cream sauce and the filling inside the ravioli. . Margarita Pizza was great too. Cheesy, saucy and a great basic pizza. . Dessert: . Lemon Sorbet was wasn't pleasant to eat at all. I felt like we were eating bitter slushy that wasn't even slushy but icy. . The customer service was 3/5 as well. The server took quite a long time to check up on us or to fill in our glasses of water. I had to put my empty glass on the edge of our table for her to notice us when she passed by. . I loved that they had a gender neutral accessibility washroom on the first floor. That was great.","I'll start by saying the pizza is really great here and so is the pasta easily four stars. Ive been here a few times, and everyone was helpful. DO NOT GET the girl server with the forehead bangs she ruined our experience. . TERRIBLE service. Wow. Came in Saturday with a couple of girlfriends, and our server was absolutely terrible. She took forever to bring us our menus, even longer to get our drinks out. It's not like she was even busy she was just screwing around on her phone at the end of the bar. We finally get her to come to the table and she was abrupt and short with us when answering some of the questions we had about the menu. When the food finally did come she practically slammed the plates down. My girlfriend didn't have silverware and again, we had to flag her down for ten mintues so we could enjoy the meal. Didn't get refills once, she didn't come by to ask how everything was. We weren't even half way through the meal when she dropped off the check, we still had a to go order to place and were thinking about dessert. We were long finished before she came back again and was really rude with us when we told her we needed to place two chicken parm dinners to go and she snachtched up the checkbook so fast. Don't know what her problem was. We asked for her superior but she told us he wasn't available, I'll talk to him next time we go in and he'll get an earful.","The Gotham pizza is the best! Their sauce is mildly sweet and I couldn't get enough. The whole slice just kept me wanting more! I know this is a heated debate. . . but pineapple does belong on pizza and I was disappointed to learn they didn't offer this as s topping choice.","We have been here twice since it opened. Once was for lunch right when they opened. The service was a bit slow, but the waitress really tried and we weren't in a hurry. They brought delicious Italian bread with butter, the salad was delicious and our entrees as well. We didn't care for the meat sauce, but liked the marinara. I had the Eggplant Parmesan and my husband had the Chicken Parmesan. Aside from the meat sauce on our pasta, we both really enjoyed our meals. . Fast forward to last week. We came at dinner time and decided to bring our kids. What a totally different experience! When we walked in, three different people were up front and none of them decided to greet us. After someone finally acknowledged us, she was marching back and forth nervous about where to put us (we all fit in a regular booth). Once settled, we waited about 10 minutes for our waitress. One thing we noticed is that the restaurant was very busy and also VERY noisy. So noisy that we couldn't hear each other and the waitress couldn't hear us. Finally ordered drinks and mozzarella sticks. Mozzarella sticks come out, bread sticks come out, still no drinks. Have to ask for our drinks twice. The breadsticks that have replaced the crusty Italian bread are crap. I get better breadsticks at chain pizza places. Now we wait. . . . . salad comes out 30 minutes later. The pizza came out. It's doesn't look too good and tastes even worse. It was soggy and the mushrooms did not taste good at all. Not even my 11 year olds would eat it. . Now for the entrees. My Eggplant Parm was okay. This time it was much drier than the last time and hardly had any cheese baked on top. My husband's Chicken Parm was coated in Ricotta cheese. Yes, you read that correctly. . . RICOTTA CHEESE! It did not have Ricotta cheese when he first ate it at this same restaurant and, when we asked about it, we were told that's what a traditional chicken parm had on it. Sorry but that's not true. It's my husband's favorite dish and he has had it several restaurants through the country. This was a first for us. . Then as we were cashing out, our waitress was our cashier up front and made it a point to watch my husband as he signed the receipt and added the tip. That is so rude. . We had such high hopes for this place, but will keep searching for a good Italian place.","I grabbed a slice during lunch and though this particular place isn't as good as the one near my house, I feel Pizza Nova overall is the best large pizza chain out there. . The slice was relatively fresh and the toppings was decent. The pizza probably could have been cooked longer or at a higher temperature. The pizza was a bit light on the veggie toppings and a bit too heavy handed on the cheese for my taste. I prefer the opposite. The sauce wasn't ground breaking but it wasn't watery, acidic, or overly sweet. . It's fast, convenient, and fresh. . . It's makes for a decent lunch.","You should by no means go out of your way to visit the Treasure Island Buffet, however IF you are already here and don't feel like going to another resort or you got one of the 2 for 1 coupons they give hotel guests, then it's not all that bad. . The buffet does have it's highlights: the lobster ravioli from the pasta station is very good, the pizza is decadently cheesy and tasty, and the cupcakes are downright delicious, especially the red velvet cupcakes. PRO TIP: grab an extra cupcake at the end of your visit and pretend like you are eating it on your way out, then save it for later. . Honestly, there isn't anything terrible about the buffet, but I can understand how those paying full price feel like they can do better as the selection does feel limited compared to other buffets. Our server was outstanding, even if all he did was get us drinks.","This place is pretty solid. I order delivery quite a bit due to my work schedule and they're usually pretty quick and the food is good. Straight up cheese pizza is on point and the pasta that I've had is good too. Plus fried mushrooms are awesome. Some items are better than others (the salads don't seem to tickle my pickle) but for NW pizza joints this place will come through. Recommended.","I don't live particularly close to this Longo's but I do make a point of visiting every time I'm in the vicinity. . First of all the store is huge and offer a great variety of almost anything you make be looking for (though they don't carry matches!!). Second the produce and meats are consistently fresh and everything seems to be appropriately stocked (I. e. store obvs has good management). . Finally, I actually like the options at the food counter here! The stuffed pizza is recommended!","The thin crust pizza we had was great. Lots of toppings. The specialty deep dish was just OK. Not really worth the wait. Its probably just a taste issue, I may not get the draw of pan pizza. Service was OK. They made mistakes on the order but were quick to make it right. I was really looking forward to trying this place. Heard about it in Chicago for years. Unfortunately I wont be in a rush to go back.","All I have ever had was their thin crust pizza. It is the bomb !!  I always try to pick one up when I'm working on that side of the valley, and have not been disappointed. Sometimes it can take quite a while for the food to be made though, as they are always super busy. Can't wait to dine in someday and try some of their other dishes.","Vegan pizza? Yes, please!! I was in Las Vegas for five days, and I went here a total of three times, so you know it's good if it's worth coming back to. They have great prices for such big slices, but I think drinks cost more than the pizza! It was worth it though. The only thing that would have been better was a bit thicker on the crust, but I know it's New York-style, so I can't really complain. My only disappointment was that they discontinued the soft serve ice cream right before I got into town. I was really looking forward to trying that.","Damnit!  They piss me off because the pizza is so yummy, but they take so long to deliver your food to you. . Honestly, I don't want to be waiting for my pizza for about and hour and forty-five minutes before I have to call to find out where it is. I just want it to get there so I can eat it while it's hot. I'll tolerate waiting an hour, but when it's closer to two it's a little delicious. . Still, I always order from them and hope they'll be quicker because I love Chicago Deep Dish pizza so much!  The favourite from them is pepperoni-hot pepper because they really load up on the peppers. . . both hot and oni!  The pizzas are square so the middle pieces are my favourite by far. . . no crusts!  Yippy!. So, in exchange for ordering my favourite pizza, I sacrifice my time and waste precious eating hours. It's a trade-up, but it's totally worth it.","Had a long trip in from California and originally went to CPK but they were too busy. Started looking on yelp and I found this nice stand alone place. Big tv's, 80's rock playing, and friendly service. Its away from the packed strip, easy to find, and the quality is there. I had their pepperoni pizza. Just the right amount of sauce and cheese. It can out hot and quick. I'm glad I found place, they will be on my list for my next trip to sin city.","YUMMY! I ordered the pepperoni and mushroom pizza with onions delivered. It arrived hot and fresh. . Wonderful!","This a great place for lunch or a specialty drink. I really enjoy the pizzas, and the coconut cake is pretty much amazing.","My boyfriend and I had just moved to an apartment near by and we were given a voucher for a free pizza and 2 liter soda at Bruno's. The owner was there and despite using the voucher he treated us so kindly and was very welcoming. Most places would immediately think you're cheap and tip poorly for some reason. It's hard to find such genuine service like Bruno's. And the pizza is incredible! They use higher quality ingredients and it shows! And the best part is that it wasn't greasy at all.","Be aware if using grub hub to deliver, the wait could be uneccesarily long and you may be better off picking it up. . Aside from that, I had a great experience with the food. Everything tasted fresh and hot. I have zero complaints about the pasta bowl meal and pizza rolls.","Amazing!. Get there early to get their Porchetta. We had the Caesar salad, spaghetti polpette, fontina egg pizza and Porchetta. Everything was great.","For a chain restaurant, they have really great pizza. My go to pizza - white garlic with sausage. My friend and I can get a large of this and finish the entire thing in one sitting! The crust is thin and chewy, while the cheese is gooey and tasty. The sausage is also very well seasoned and gives extra flavor to the pizza, offsetting the garlic bits across the pizza. . They also have seasonal cheesecakes and tiramisu. My favorite is their tiramisu, where the lady fingers are soaked with just the right amount of espresso. But in my personal opinion: ask for it without the chocolate syrup. They drizzle the syrup on the bottom of the plate and overpowers the already delicious flavors of the tiramisu.","4. 5 stars. I'm not sure why the pizza tastes so much better in Madison then it does in other cities where I've had pizza (mainly on the  West Coast),  there must be something in the air. They have some interesting options for specialty pizzas but I'm not a huge fan of greasy fatty foods so I've only tried the  Fetalicious, Thai , Deluxe, BBQ, and Mediteranean all which were great. They have some great deals online and delivery is free! Pizza from here is never disappointing and whenever I ask for extra sauce, less cheese, or well done they always accomodate. They aren't as cheap as dominos or papa johns but they also dont skimp on toppings and I've never had a problem with their delivery. They have some other options on their menu besides pizza, I've only tried their spinich cheese bread and their crispy chicken and fries both which were super tasty. I've never been disappointed with the food or the service here so I would definitely recommend this place.","I love Upper Crust. The best red sangria! Sometimes the service can slack but the pizza is amazing and ambiance is great.","honestly i wanted to like this place the pizzas are amazing ! however triied the philly didn't care for the bread the cool thing is they have drinks like dr browns etc. and decently priced friend had white garlic pizza - I had there pizza  in the past and always good","My husband and I had walked past this place a few times during our stay in Toronto. The smell had us salivating every time! We had lunch here on a Saturday. We were seated immediately (since we were the only people there) by a very friendly waitress. The place had just opened so it was nice and quiet and service was super quick. We skipped appetizers and went straight for the pizza. I had the Tre Carne which was great! The meats were very flavorful and banana peppers were nice and spicy. Very delicious! My husband asked if he could have a pizza that wasn't on the menu, it wasn't a problem at all. They obliged his request. Price was VERY reasonable for the area. The pizzas were about 12 inches each, more than enough to satisfy. My husband and I had a pretty big appetite and I polished off about half and my husband about 3 quarters. We had enough to take back to our hotel and have a whole other meal. I definitely suggest this place for a quick cheap lunch.","I love this place. they have never gotten an order wrong and have always been really nice to me. It is the closest papa johns to me and that's still a long drive so my pizza is never hot when i get it home and that will usually make a pizza taste bad but i have not had a bad pizza yet. its great food as a reasonable price","Great food, nice staff &amp; beautiful restaurant!! I had the spinach artichoke pizza on a thin crust with chicken. It was prepared perfectly.","It's a bowling alley in a college town, so you really can't expect much. It's very run-of-the mill without any bells and whistles. Reminds me of the bowling alley I went to as a kid 20 years ago. . . and it probably hasn't been updated in 20 years, either. They do have automated scoring, but it's the first automated scoring system that was ever introduced to a bowling alley. Very, very low-tech.  . They offer a concessions stand with your typical crappy bowling alley fare (pizza, burgers, hot dogs, nachos), and they also have a bar. You can enter the bar separately, or order drinks through a window in the alley. Heads up, though, you can only get drink specials if you're sitting in the bar. Drinks are cheap though. A rum and coke and a Bud cost us only $5. 50 (and the rum and coke was all rum and a splash of coke). . I'm not sure what the average price for bowling is nowadays, but we paid $3 for shoes and $3. 50 per game per person, which seemed a bit steep to me. They do have different bowling specials every night of the week (all you can bowl for $6, quarter nights with a $6 cover charge, ladies night, etc), but many of these specials don't start until about 9:00 or 10:00. . At 8:00 on a Friday, there was a mixed crowd. Some \"pro\" bowlers, some families, some younger people. As 9:00 drew closer, the clientele began to change. A group of very stond teenagers joined in the lane next to us, so we decided to take our leave. . Staff were all friendly, as were all of the other customers who were very chatty with us. Good place to go if you want to hang with the locals instead of the college kids (though maybe they come out later in the evening). I'll probably be back.","The BEST pan pizza I've ever had is at Caliente - so delicious! Typically I've only had takeout from Caliente, but it's a fun place to stop in and sit as well. The spinach and feta rolls are also out of this world. Probably wouldn't order take out fries again - ours were soggy and a bit disappointing, but I think ordering them while at the restaurant would make a difference. They have so many different fry options if you're a fry lover like me. Caliente is one of my go-tos for all things comfort food!","Excellent food. Try the Sicilian pizza. It Is Terrific! We were  in from out of town and looking for good pizza and found it. Grace was super nice.","Just finished our third stay at the Flamingo. We are big fans of the Go rooms, the adults only pool ( The large pool is now strictly 18 and older) and it's location on the strip. By and large we spent hardly anytime at all in the casino itself. Do wish it had a cool bar or lounge.  . Plenty of Yelpers have added some helpful hints, but thought we would pass on a few too. . Check in: Might be worth using the desk vs. the quick computer check in. We tried the quick check in and ended up staying in the Habitat tower. . . . last year stayed in the Spa tower and enjoyed the layout a little more. The Habitat tower is guarded by Westin employees trying to give you a \"free\" gift. Not a deal breaker, but ask for the spa tower Go rooms. By all means, BOOK A GO ROOM. . Pool:  Don't expect to easily get a lounge chair if you show up past 10AM.  Think people run down to the pool and put towels on them at first light. . . play the game and do the same!  Grab a bloody mary while you are down there. . . . they are awesome and only $5  from 8-11AM. The waitresses at the pool are swamped with orders, but all the ones we had the pleasure of talking to were super cute. . I mean super sweet and helpful! If your hungry, order a burger!  Very filling and it goes well with the $20 bucket of beer. Jeannie enjoyed the turkey wrap. Tried the hotdog. It had some major shrinkage going on ( supposed to be a Nathan's) and ended up filling up mostly on the fries. . Margaritaville: Stepped in there for the first time. . . for breakfast on the day we checked out. A good bet and the price is on the low end for Vegas. Have to try the bar one night. . . . Late night snack. There is a food court ( two actually) that has a Johnny Rockets, a pizza place, a Panda Express-like joint and a sub  &amp; salad place. Had a pizza night cap twice and it was goooooood! Sausage and Pepperoni slice hit the spot. . Location:  There are so many entertainment and food options near by that you might want to be prepared to walk just a little. Venetian &amp; the Mirage are just within  comfortable walking distance (heels might be a challenge ladies) Harrah's &amp; Caesar's are easy! Didn't really go the other direction, but think about keeping the car parked. A much more colorful trip will be had on foot as you get a close up view of the Vegas \"humanity\".","my family loves it here and have been several times! my child had a bday party here a couple times, as well and both were great! they were a lot of fun for the kiddos, who also loved having their own space for bowling &amp; hanging out, and very easy for the parents. The hostesses and coordinator were great, friendly and made the parties a smooth success; I recommend having a party here, its well worth it!  The movies comfy chairs, popcorn, drink dispenser, pizza and delivery to your movie seat are great. they are reasonably priced and decent quality.  the golfing is fine, although the course could be a little longer for play.  the place is clean and i feel good about bringing my kiddos here, overall. . if i could change anything, i'd say have some measures for assigned theater seats to ensure people take the seats they chose. you can't count on all people using common courtesy or respect no matter where you go, and we've had that issue a couple times. its bound to happen, but some people don't handle these situations well. overall though, we've had some great family experiences here and we recommend it.","Very hipster place, loved the vibe and the staff. Good took a bit long to arrive even though it was rather empty. Great food though, pizza was probably the least wow, still very good but the burgers are a must!","The Food and The Drinks= Wow. . I just tried this place for the first time last night and now I am disappointed that I have never been here before. I love the quaint feeling you get when you walk in and by 6pm the place was crowded and the vibe was perfect. It wasn't too loud but you could tell everyone was enjoying the place. . Check out the Happy Hour menu (M-F 4pm-7pm)! Martinis and Wines are $6. 50, Domestics are $3, Pizzas are $6. 50 and they have a ton other food items that are priced amazingly. . I started off with the Naked Cosmo (white cranberry juice instead of regular). I actually sipped this martini slow because it was so delicious! My sister and I each ordered a pizza. I ordered the Apple Crisp Pizza while my sister ordered the Caramelized Onion Pizza. The bartender was awesome and modified our order by putting different cheeses on only half of each pizza. I don't care for goat cheese and my sister doesn't care for blue cheese. The bartender offered this suggestion of half and half like it was no big deal for the kitchen. How refreshing! Someone who isn't annoyed by modifications. . Both pizzas were amazing! I didn't want to stop eating them, however, I  did have leftovers so that I could order the Chocolate Covered Maple Bacon dessert. Wow! What a treat. It is served with vanilla ice cream that is drizzled with chocolate sauce. . I will be back soon to check out other menu items!","What a great spot for a business lunch with multiple agendas!  The open layout of Vapiano affords patrons the opportunity to intermingle without hesitation. The atmosphere is light and bristling with a restrained temerity. First timers will need to pay attention when they're greeted or they'll be lost. . You'll get a card that places all your purchases on it. You go where you want, get what you want, and pay at the front when you're ready to leave. You're a big boy. . . you can do it. . The food here is nice. I've only had the pizza and salads and haven't been disappointed. Every employee I've encountered had been more than helpful. . My only advice to Vapiano would be concerning the pizza condiments at the end of the pizza counter. A spoon and a container of crushed red pepper make for a difficult experience when putting red pepper on your pizza.  . Overall, Vapiano is bustling, fragrant, and a comfortable experience. Give it a try. I know I'll be back.","I love the atmospher here. . Also the pizza is very good and they have a decent size beer selection. . Great place for a night out.","And here I thought this would be a typical chain of basic Italian fast food, NOPE! The service and food was incredible,  it was really a nice surprise to see a small local restaurant on campus as opposed to another pizza pan or rascal house. I will recommend this place to anyone I speak to, good people, good prices, good food!","I've been to the Markham location and was quite impressed! I believe they're under new management now but the old management was great. They were always so friendly and the ingredients were always fresh, I often saw one of the three main workers walking in with arms full of Whole Foods bags, filled to the brim with organic greens and vegetables. . I've tried the raw pizza, pad thai, collard wrap, and rawitch and they were all great. Food is prepared right when you order. Desserts here are also very good- notably the cheesecake and the coconut/chocolate balls. . Definitely worth a try if you're in the area! I don't know how it is now, but when I went it was not that busy so service was always top notch, which I've heard is sometimes compromised at the busier Yorkville location. Ambience is pretty and cozy, decorated with art from local artists. Juice/smoothie menu also offers a lot of choice.","This is my favorite pizza of all time! It is always hot and delicious and HUGE. Don't even think about ordering a large unless you're trying to feed a small army. I recommend ordering a side of their fried ravioli. Yum. Why Not Pizza is by far the best pizza you can get in Charlotte!","I have given this place 2 tries and they are just terrible. The sauce here taste funny and the overall pizza was not good. The worst thing about this place is the wait times. The last time I order over the phone app and it said my pizza was ready for pickup at 6:10pm. I got there right on time and watched them hand my order to the person in front of me. They then had to remake my order which made me wait there for 20 minutes.","This place is great. Lots of activities for the family that will not cost you an arm and a leg to enjoy. Bowling and food are way inexpensive compared to Main Event and Flip Side. The movie theaters are a plus, they have nice recliners with a lot of leg room. You get to pick your own seats and the prices are cheaper than Harkins. I do like the free refills of soda. We also had a birthday party for my son. Melisa, our host and event manager, provided us with excellent service. Get the package that provides bowling, pizza, and glow in the dark golf. It's worth it. Overall this is my new place to watch a movie, no worries about finding a seat just buy them ahead of time. This place is still under the radar that's why the theaters are not so packed but eventually it will get there.","Do yourselves a favor and come here for dinner. . . great menu, great drinks, great atmosphere. . . GREAT FOOD!!!  . It's a very unique place.  . If you want to come and watch NFL, get great food, see the game on large projection screens and have a great variety of inexpensive drinks, you can do that. . If you want to come and have a freshly prepared high end meal developed by a high end chef. Drinks that pair well, quiet, non-crowded atmosphere, you can do that too. . If you want to belly up, play some video poker and chat up the bartender. . . . DO THAT!. BTW - Tagging this place as a Pizza place doesn't do it justice, although their pizza is the best in town as far as I'm concerned!","CHAR has delicious fired pies, bruschetta &amp; cocktails! I mean, what's not to love with that combo?! I love the concept of choosing my own toppings \u00e0 la Chipotle &amp; the mix/match bruschetta deal. Their service is always great, I love that they always change gloves &amp; are extra careful for gluten &amp; dairy free orders. Their happy hour is pretty awesome, $6 pizzas, $6 cocktails &amp; wine! I love the patio setting, makes it such a nice place to bring the family.","Note: The only poor rating should be taken with a large grain of salt. . . . . Been coming here ever since I moved from NY. The woman that worked there full time was diagnosed with cancer and is recovering I found out. Her name is Birdy or Bertie. This is the woman who is accused of being too \"stoned\" to cook pizza. She was definitely a personality but is a good hearted person. . The young girls covering her shifts indefinitely do an amazing job and it's like the pizza gets better every time I go. . They had a hiccup on an order and gave me a free pizza for having to wait longer than was said when I went in for a pickup order. The Two Mediums for 10 bucks is my favorite deal they offer. They also have some creative and delicious combination. Check em out and support local business in Ohio City!. P. S they only overcook pizzas when you call in for an order right before close. They usually have to turn everything back on and turn the oven up high so they can go home just like anyone wants to go home after working long hours I'm sure.","So I told 3 of my friends about $10 tuesday. . we usually go out to dinner together once a month. So we planned this about a month ago and the sisters I guess found a coupon for a free pizza (I have no idea what the coupon says). So we are seated and hand waitress coupon they order there cheese pizza I'm next and said $10 cheese and sausage you can't have that price with coupon ok I'll sit at another table cause your pizza isn't worth $20 waitress says you can't do that. Our other friend can't have red sauce of course they don't have white cheese pizza anyways it goes on  what my problem is , is that the waitress sees we are upset and doesn't say anything but negatively. A great waitress  (customer service) would of said oh this might work for you and this price would be better. . nothing . . None of us will be back. .","Mama told me never to talk with my mouth full. So this is going to be short and sweet. . There are few restaurants in our beautiful city that actually know how to make Pizza. Like, REALLY make pizza. The way it should be made. The way it's made in Italy. . Bevo is one of them. . Let's just say that while stuffing my pretty little face, I was anything but a lady. And using the excuse \"where I come from we eat it with our hands\" didn't quite have the desired effect. Rather, Mr. Haze just rolled his eyes, and ducked his head out of sight of confused neighbouring tables. To summarize: the sauce is outstanding, the cheese is amazingly fresh mozzarella and it's so perfectly thin. . . the piece de resistance, the wood-burning oven- what a beaut. . DO NOT get me started on the Nutella pizza (I ate the whole thing to myself). There is nothing, NOTHINGGGG better. Ideal mixture of salty and sweet, and gooey and crispy, and chocolate and bread, and . . . and. . . and. . . Looking back I could tell you that the service was beyond friendly and attentive, that the music was rockin', that the crowd was good lookin' and that it had a great post-dinner party vibe. But last night, at exactly 9:37 pm, none of that mattered, it was just me and my Pizza Pie all alone in that big ol' restaurant. THAT'S AMORE.","Unbelievable. I mean this pizza was fantastic!! Loved it, so fresh, perfect! The salad was delicious too! We got a margharita pizza &amp; the house salad, which comes with a raspberry vinaigrette. I loved everything about that meal &amp; can't wait to go there again! They bring you a bowl of olives before you're meal just like next door at Cenacolo. I could've had. I thing else &amp; been happy. I don't know what kind of love they put into their food but you feel it when you eat there! Do yourself a favor &amp; go!","Can't believe I'm just now getting around to reviewing Joe's. Lately I eat here more than I eat at home!. This is the quintessential non-chain eating experience. Joe's grub isn't cheap, but you get what you pay for, and Brak would FAR rather pay more for good grub than suffer with a \"bargain\" meal. Joe's delivers great value despite the high prices, because the food is that good. . I've had lots of things on the menu and loved all of it. For some reason, I'd avoided the BBQ chicken pizza for a long time, probably because I've had others that weren't so hot. Then I caught the clip on DD&amp;D on Food Network (search for \"Joe's Farm Grill\" on youtube to see it), which featured the pie, and realized that if Joe was serving it to Guy Fieri, then it MUST be awesome. Well, I'm here to tell you, it is freaking awesome!  Currently my favorite meal on the entire planet. I'm getting a hankerin' for one right now, just writing about it. . despite the fact that I had one yesterday!. If you're anywhere in the area and haven't been to Joe's, do yourself a favor and get your ass over here, you will NOT be disappointed. A solid 5+ stars on the Brak-o-meter.","This is a cool hip place in the uptown area. You walk in get a card and anytime you order something you just scan the card. They have pizza, pasta, salads and soup for about $9-$13. The chicken alfredo and the ricotta spinaci are so far my favorite. I had the cream di funghi which was a bit disappointing. . As for dessert, you can't go wrong with the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e!","Great pizza and subs. If you are in East end definitely worth the trip. . Their appetizers are great too. I wish I took pictures. . . Too busy enjoying with soccer buddies. . Big screen TVs as well. Awesome. We watched the superbowl. . .","Favorite pizza place in Phoenix. The ingredients they use are noticeably superior. Thin crust always, you aren't paying for bread here!. I haven't tried everything here tho.","first time here to this pizza i order 1 big slice pizza definitely really good pizza and will try the chicken wings too. will always come back here","I have visions of their tomado basil soup.  it comes with garlic bread croutons on the side that literally melt in your mouth once you've added them to the homemade soup.  drizzle some of that parmesan cheese they give you, and you've got yourself the best soup you can ask for.  . they have a bunch of other really great things here too.  i've had sandwiches there (try the turkey foccacia. . . yuuuum) or chicken pesto salad sandwich. . . they have homemade pizzas for one that are unique and flaky. . . they have gigantic salads leaving no hunger for your appetite to squash. . and they have great smoothies. . this place is the place to go if you're looking for lunch downtown.  but they're only open for lunch monday-friday, so don't go looking for some tasty eats on saturday afternoon.  you forget the city is a ghost town after six on friday. . mmm. tasty treats.","Amazing nigiri. Not much else to say in regards to their nigiri. Their maki could use a little work, because they lightly burned my salmon skin roll. Came here and tried their omakase (6 course meal) and it was pretty worth it if you haven't tried it yet. Also had the tuna pizza as an appetizer, which was both delicious and worth it. The Morimoto-style chirashi bowl was also very good and worth it for the price. Would honestly stick to that after having tried their omakase for the first time. Honestly, the surf and turf was the only thing that was majorly disappointing (the steak wasn't that great). Despite those small things, I'm definitely coming here again every time I'm in Vegas.","Highly recommend Fairmount happy hour and patio. I come here pretty often with my girlfriends--if we want a quick drink to catch up or to drink away a bad day =)  If you come for HH, it's $5 pizzas and half off martini's. The pizzas are pretty damn good. For drinks, I recommend the Dark and Stormy (rum and ginger beer-so delicious and strong), Moscow Mule, Blackbird (their berry compote is to die for), La Verdita (if you're feeling adventurous and love you some spice), and if you're jonesing for something girly the Chocolate Martini. They also have a lot of good wine and beer options (Christmas ale!). Servers are pretty attentive and friendly, although sometimes if it's busy service can get pretty slow. I recommend just going up to the bar in those cases. The patio is a must if it's nice out!","I LOVE Freemont St, and downtown Vegas. Have stayed numerous times and always have a blast!! In saying that, LOVE Hashouse in the Plaza for breakfast, &amp; their pizza joint for late night snack, but I will NEVER be staying there again. Our reservation with bookings. com got mixed up, and they were not accommodating at all, we considered switching hotels our first night cause there were grimey handprints everywhere, the shower looked DISGUSTING and weird hair left on the sheets. We figured it was only two nights so we'd just tough it out. Go figure my boyfriend got athletes foot, and I was too afraid to shower the rest of the trip I bathed in the sink. GROSS GROSS GROSS!!!","The place needs a facelift, badly. It felt grungy; there was a stain of some kind on one of the seats at our table and the table was sticky. Our daughter's \"cheese pizza\" was on a tortilla and the cheese was not melted all the way along with WAY too much sauce. Either the waitress or the chef got my order wrong (a totally different dish than I ordered) so while my family ate I had to wait for my food to be remade. Only good part about our experience was that we had a gift card so we only paid $13 after tip.","Seriously darn good pizza and the best service humanly possible.","I love the Rocky River location close to where I live and now I can order Danny Boys catering now that the Broadview Heights location opened by my work! Score! . Last week  I called just after 11 when they opened and they were able to delivery in about an hour lunch for 6 at my business meeting. Friendly service, fair price (we have a per head price we can't go over and they can meet it), good food, reliable delivery- perfect!  Thank you Danny Boys, pizza makes work meetings MUCH more fun.","I am rating this place a 5 because of their great customer service. The pizza was delicious and I would give it 4 stars. . Went last night with a friend, ordered a medium veggie pizza with two sodas. They took the pizza to our table and it was really good! Thin, crispy, and hot! An older gentleman took napkins, offered us cheese and pepper and put them on our table -without us having to ask. As well as refills. They seem to care about their customers. To be honest I love pizza and I've tried a lot but their pizza was good especially their crunchy crust. Not to mention that nothing was burned or over/under cooked either. Nice friendly &amp; attentive :)","Excellent pizza and great fresh mozzarella). Service left something to be desired. We arrived one hour prior to closing, and our initial service (getting drinks, taking our order, getting our appetizer) was painfully slow. Then it appeared that the wait staff realized that closing time was approaching, and the rest of the night we had incredibly speedy - borderline rude - service. As we walked away at five minutes to closing, I observed a waiter lowering an outdoor umbrella and nearly hitting a patron in the head. . The pizza was great, but I think I'll stick with take out or delivery from now on.","My wife and I stopped here for a quick dinner. We ordered The Gotham, which was a very good pizza!  The service was very good too. We'll stop here again!","Nice place. Great pizza. Good beer (except Sept-Oct when all they have is pumpkin beer or Oktoberfest) BUT. . . . their floor is always SLIPPERY AF. It's not wet, it's just a regular wood floor that is inexplicably slippery. Wear sturdy shoes. . . or a helmet.","The place is nice and clean, we were seated immediately. The staff was nice and very attending. I ordered a pizza and I must say it was delicious. I try pizza everywhere I go and I must say this is on my top 10 list. The crust was perfectly charred and flavorful. My wife had the steak sandwich with onions and actually liked it(she is picky). Great service great food and over all a great restaurant.","Food ***** - Service*** - Ambience ***. Absolutely love their food. We have been here multiple times and this always pops up as the go to place when can't decide on where to go. . The portion sizes are good. Their pizzas, pastas and chicken dishes are delicious. . Their tiramisu is unforgettably delicious. . Strongly Recommended","This is when those places that at night it's pretty sketchy to go into it's right behind a Sonic and a old little strip center by a gym a liquor store a Chinese restaurant a massage parlor no lights at night really random building mugging waiting to happen right but finally got in here to try it seriously I've had a lot of the Chicago style pizzas their thin crust is the best I've ever had their deep dish was okay I think I just don't like deep dish too hard or something it's almost like cake flour last anywhere you go but the thin crust Italian beef and hot peppers was so delicious little bit of a sweet sauce but not too sweet the cheese was really good too definitely a place to stop if you're in the area but that weird hours so check or call them first and not too badly price","Went to this place several times when first opened. Good pizza and good service. The last two times was poor. Went yesterday (10/24) Called in a carry out. Rep stated 15-20 mins. Arrived---no pizza stated 5 more mins, -- no problem. I waited and waited and waited and waited. 45 mins later it was ready with No apologize, nothing. I asked several times how much longer, each time 5 mins. End result: poor customer service, pizzas were wrong when I got home But they were good. It was apparent by looking thru the glass of the pizza making process several new people were working but not trained well. Would not suggest this place considering there is about a dozen pizza joints within 2 miles. But this would be a good location to open a real pizza restaurant.","You will find culinary influences of Argentina when you visit Charbar, and if you get the chance take a peek at the Argentine wood-fired grill, one of the inspirations behind their identity. . I have been here a handful of times already, and I'm slowly working my way through the menu. There is nothing I've tried and don't like. In fact I have favourites and tend to order them each time along with other dishes. Love smaller bites and being able to have several dishes in front of you at once. Every time I come I learn a little bit more about the restaurant and inspiration behind it. . Charbar, along with 2 others (Phil &amp; Sebastian Coffee Roasters and Sidewalk Citizen Bakery) are located in the historical Simmons building. When you are inside it feels like the walls and old wood posts have so much to say, I wish they could share their stories. . We were able to sit on the patio one night for my husbands birthday back in August before heading downstairs for dinner. Gorgeous views on the patio and a perfect date experience. Another time I've both lunched and dined with girl friends. Dinner meetings are lovely here as well and always accommodating. I even attended a recent wine event upstairs there complete with cheese bites. . Through my adventures the service has always been spot on. And the food incredibly flavourful. I love the variety of chimichurri sauces they have (I've tried 3: red/green/white) and as I mentioned I am working my way through the menu. One of my favourites is the Fugazza (pizza). . Charbar has everything I look for in a great restaurant. Good service, incredible food, friendly staff, a lovely setting and ambiance, even the location is easy to get to. Resos recommended.","The pizza came out late and cold but it was still good just wish it would have been warm. The spinach side dish was great. We also ordered the swordfish silicon which was a little dry but good sauce and nice veggies. Service was slow but we met a nice couple next to us from Australia so it helped pass the time. Overpriced for the food court location.","Best pizza and wings in the queen city! ! Nice place for a date or hang with friends. Service is awesome. I will be back for sure!","Drink list was extensive with several beer, wine and cocktail options. Restrooms though not many were very clean. Our waiter was awesome though sadly I do not remember his name. We had caprese and garlic bread apps of which both were outstanding. The special was BBQ chicken pizza which I'm told by those with me was awesome. Sitting outside people watching and seeing the high roller was great and not too crowded or warm with umbrellas. Its a bit pricey but its Vegas !","I definitely was not impressed with this place. Which was odd because nothing but great things about it. The dining was freezing and you could tell the plumping was older. I got an order of their oven baked fries and they were no where near as good a deep fried one and you could tell that they came out of a bag. . I ordered a personal pan pizza and it was a little greasy. I don't think I'd  go back on my own volition.","Tucked away in the corner of Ontario and King, this place is truly a hidden gem. The service for starters is impeccable; very attentive and our orders came quickly. They also start you off with complimentary bread which is very nice, but the real show stopper is the pizza! The pies are very large and the crusts are super thin, reminiscent of pizza from Sicily. They have a wide selection of pizzas and pastas, so you're bound to find something you like! Also, the interior is so cute. Perfect place for a second date :)","I have tried this place now twice for delivery and pickup and their pizza is delicious! I haven't been served in the restaurant yet and it looks ok inside but this is my new replacement for any other to go pizza places. . . The first pizza i ordered was no longer warm , took too long to deliver but was still delicious so i decided to pick up next time. If you are looking for a place who cares about ingredients this is a good choice. The size is great and pizza takes just as good the next day after warming up in the oven","My parents and I went here because we had a Groupon. I was pretty excited to try it out since it is so close to my house and my previous favorite pizza joint wasn't cutting it. This place was a major let down and I will not be going back there. . Meal:  I had a 12\", original crust pizza with olives, ham, and mozzarella cheese.  . Taste:  This was perhaps the most bland pizza I have ever had. The crust didn't seem like it was cooked all the way . . . this is just a guess but I think it was a frozen crust. I think a 2x4 with salt sprinkled on would have more depth and interesting flavors than this pizza.  4 out of 10. . Value:  Had it not been for the Groupon, this would have been way too expensive. This place is crazy expensive and it really feels like they nickle and dime you.  2 out of 5. . Service/Cleanliness:  The people who work there are incredibly nice and they sure got the pizza out quick. The person who took my order was the only real bright spot during the experience.  10 out of 10. . Atmosphere:  It is a cute place but it would be nice if they had a place to sit down and eat. I think if they did this, it would be a half way decent place to get lunch.  2 out of 5. . Overall:  Skip this place. The food is not good and the value is just as bad. I would go here if it was the last pizza place in the east valley.  18 out of 30 points, 1 out of 5 stars.","it was rather speedy for pizza-which was nice because we were a bit hungry. Not your typical pizza. the cheeses used are different and less common on this side of the world (I guess lol). . . it was almost like goat cheese. The crust texture was very nice. Very garlic-kee. . . (which I liked). Not sure that Id return, but had a great experience. the staff was all smiles, happy, and nice. pricing was very reasonable for the strip. (sadly, wasnt really fond of the wine suggestions :(","Came on a Saturday night around 7 and were sat immediately. It is a smaller place with a bar capable of seating 15 or so and about 15 tables. . I'm not sure if it's a nightly occurrence but there was a gentleman playing on their piano and a young lady singing. It provided a nice ambiance. . The menu consists of apps, salads, a few pastas, traditional entrees and pizza. We had the stuffed mushrooms as an app and weren't too impressed. They weren't terrible, just nothing special. The entrees were a different story. My husband's mushroom lasagna was to die for. Great flavor, perfectly cooked noodles with just the right amount of each ingredient. I had the veal parm and it hit the spot. Veal was tender and had just the right amount of breading. Their marinara is homemade and fantastic. I could've eaten it with a spoon all on its own. The portion was quite generous and was accompanied by spaghetti and marinara. Our only compliant was that they do not offer draft beers and their bottled beer selection was very limited. . While many traditional Italian dishes are not listed on the menu our server informed us that items like marsalas and piccatas are available upon request.","My bf and I came here hoping for a nice fancy meal to celebrate my birthday. He ordered the chicken meatballs and BBQ fries and I got the 10 oz classic-cut filet. Sad to say we were sorely disappointed. I shit you not, I have had a better steak at Chili's before and I fucking hate Chili's. Bf paid an exorbitant amount for 3 meatballs and over-seasoned mediocre fries. I got an awful over-seasoned (COVERED in black pepper), under cooked (ordered medium rare and got rare), tasteless, dry filet mignon steak. It came pre-cut so I assume the juices disappeared once the chef or server carved the meat before it got to our table. . Only redeeming dish were the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings, but even that wasn't enough to make this more than a disappointing meal. . Total came up to $105, which is crazy for the quality (or lack of) we received. I was kind of expecting the bill to be discounted a bit because the manager came by to ask us what was wrong since we told our server the food was \"alright. \" Not coming back again. You'd make a better decision choosing ANY of the other Cosmo restaurants. Even secret pizza would've been better.","I was one of the very first customers of Nello's when it opened as a sandwich shop in Tempe. Over the years the Ahwatukee location has maintained the original quality of the pizza and sandwiches and the Chicago pizza joint ambiance the Mai brothers had at the original location. . Their gluten free crust is as good as the original, which makes it my daughter's favorite place. The beer and wine selection is good and the staff is always friendly, courteous and efficient. . There are lots of fancy pizza places to assuage the snobbery of the pretentious types. Nello's is for those who want to dig into a genuine, authentic Chicago pie.","For starters, the place smelled incredible when we walked in. Great selection of toppings and some interesting gourmet options. We ordered a sweet chili and it turned out to be the perfect combo of sweet and spicy. And this might be the perfect pizza crust - soft on the inside but crispy on the outside. Delicious! Def gonna order here again.","One of my favorite New York style pizzas in Las Vegas for sure. I've dined in a few times and every time the pizza was fresh and hot and the price is good too","Went there yesterday and got a personal pan pizza pepperoni . It took 25 minutes to make . But came out delicious . Had to use a fork and knife . Only negative. 2 chairs and no air conditioning . Will go back for sure","I and my wife went for a quick bite and a drink. We asked for happy hour menu and ordered Cured Salmon Crostini, Veal Arancini and two glasses of Chardonnay. These two appetizers were so small, I mean really unbelievable! :-) Each plate had only four small, small bites. I didn't expect that it will be plenty but still they got me surprised. I ordered pizza so at least we can finish drinking our wine. Pizza had six slices, plate size. Reason why I gave two stars is that appetizers were tasty but way to small and pizza Margherita was nothing special.","I've been hearing about this place from co-workers, seeing this place on the Travel Channel in Food Wars and other specialty food shows, and a couple months ago, finally got to try it. . The inside is very nice (not really what you'd expect in a pizza joint)- red/white checker topped tables, surrounded by framed pictures of New York City points of interest (bridge) and old-time celebs (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin) on all the walls. There is a small bar. Also, there is seating al frasco, too. In one corner, there is a round table for a cozy get-together. . The service is pretty good- the staff is nice and friendly. The atmosphere is nice. It's a little small (but there is also seating at the Bar, and al fresco, too). The pizza is pretty good- thin crust, good sauce, good cheese. My husband &amp; I shared a pie (had leftovers). I think, maybe, my husband (who is half Italian) thought it was good, but not spectacular. At the time, the baby wasn't eating too many solids, so we didn't share our meal with him. Funny story: the baby was having his bottle and he ended up falling asleep at the table, in the highchair. . . About the Menu, choose the item and size- personal, small, large (pizza, calzone) and then select your toppings (which takes up half the menu- meats, veggies, extra sauce, basil, garlic, etc. ). If you get any starters, it's several choices of salads. Also has desserts, cold drinks, and wine &amp; beer. . I'm curious about the calzones. I could order it for pickup. I would definitely try this place again.","Get the \"fat free skinny pizza\" it is a carnivores dream. You will not be sorry. My friends ordered the \"kilt lifter\" beer and loved it.","The pizzas are affordable and customizable. There's definitely competition when it comes to pizza in downtown / uptown Pittsburgh, but Genoa holds its own. They even serviced me by creating a pizza with custom toppings and no cheese! That was delicious.","Honestly, for what purpose it is supposed to serve, this place was more than sufficient. Went to the high roller and realized there's like a little mini outdoor mall so hubs and I went on a stroll. It's in a really poppin area across the \"street\" from ghiradelli store, etc. . This place was exactly what I expected it to be, you stand in line at a stand, order, pay, get your food and stand drunkenly mindlessly shoving pizza in your mouth. Drunkenly, this pizza was great. Hubs' blood sugar was running low(er) and we got a slice and shared it, I would say it's similar to Secret Pizza at cosmo, similar style and totally sufficient. Neither are the best pizza I'm EVER going to have in my life and I don't expect that from a pizza stand in vegas. . The prices are what is to be expected like $5 per slice, and the process was simple and easy. If I were in the area craving a quick bite, would totally recommend this place.","Went here for dinner. Make sure to get some items from the build your own charcuterie board, amazing selections. Also, the pizzas are a little larger then personal size, order some appetizers and split a pizza, then you get to try more great food.","The Flaming Ice Cube serves really tasty vegan food! I had the corn chowder which was really great, as well as the pizza burger, which was pretty good. Our server told me the burger was really filling. I ordered it since I was starving, but by the time I finished my soup I could only make it halfway through the burger. We also got pumpkin cupcakes, which were perfect - I would never have known they were vegan!","This was my second time at Bannock as a year later I was still dreaming of the duck poutine pizza. I had it again (get one for the table, we splitting between 10 people as an appetizer) and it didn't disappoint. The duck was moist and fries were still a little crisp amidst the gravy and cheese curds. . I tried the octopus main as the waitress said it was amazing. While it was tasty enough, I wouldn't order it again as it was very little octopus and a lot of tomato sauce. The grains salad on the other hand was delicious. It had a melange of grains and some crisp vegetables in a light dressing. It was hearty without being heavy and totally enjoyable. I also had the beets in horseradish creme fresh which were a nice addition but probably not worth the up sell. . Now, I realize that when large groups go out there is a gratuity added to the bill. As I was in a bit of a rush, I didn't notice and tipped again. We then ran into problems as I tried to address this with the server as I wanted to redo the bill. Her attitude wasn't becoming lets just say and her comments of \"I thought I just did a really good job\" were not appreciated. It took me asking for the manager to get this all sorted and she took her sweet time getting back to us. When the bill is almost 1000 dollars and two people already tipped 30%, it would have been great if she just fixed it. I have to say, it left me with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, despite all the good food.","Great local place for affordable but delicious pizza. It's a great alternative for Pizza Pizza if you're on a budget but want something good.","I stayed at the Flamingo this past weekend  (June 22nd-24th) and we had such a great time! it was a quick stay only two nights:. The room:. We stayed in a standard room, it was on the 20th floor. We had a great view of the pool and loved the HUGE open windows looking out into the pool area. There was a flat screen TV, a large king sized bed with this awesome fur throw on the bottom of the bed, and hardwood floors! I was VERY Impressed. Last time I had stayed at the Stratosphere &amp; this was such an upgrade. . The location:. Perfect location right in the middle of the strip. Right by the Venetian (also saw blue man group while we were there, I would def recommend that show) and across the street from Serendipity. . The pool:. Got to visit the 21+ pool on both friday &amp; saturday. Friday after the sun had gone down the pool was a little messyw ith beer bottles but nonetheless was fun! it's a great PARTY environment. Not a good place if you just want to relax, but if you want to have fun you will enjoy it. There is this amazing cave with a water fall you can swim under. Saturday it was very crowded but everyone was very nice and it was a fun environment. The drinks are expensive (but it's vegas- what do you expect?) and you cannot bring outside drinks into the hotel. Checkin:. Checkin was easy , but that could be because of the time we got there. Checkout was easier we just left our keys in the room &amp; left to the airport. . The food in the hotel was alright. We had johnnyrockets &amp; the pizza place downstairs by the elevators. Nothing to complain about. . Overall a FUN PARTY environment for people who want to let lose and enjoy a good hotel for a great price.","Fun fact about this place: the owner, James Trees, is the brother of my current hairstylist. . Anyway, I came to Esther's Kitchen for their first Crafthaus Brewery pairing dinner. There were many beer choices and dishes to try out, ranging from vegan cauliflower to pizza. The Silver State Blonde Ale IPA from Crafthaus was one of my favorites. My favorite meal course was probably the bread and the pasta. It kinda reminded me of The Last Supper, since we all sat together during this special dinner. . Also, check out the bathrooms. While you're in there, there's a chalkboard on the door inside that you can doodle on. . I rarely come downtown now, but this place was definitely worth a try. Chef James runs an awesome restaurant.","I found this spot on Yelp a few weeks ago. I had a taste for pizza tonight so I stopped in to check them out. Clean, friendly, good service and GREAT pizza! We ordered the 10\" meat lovers. The portion was plenty for two. The cashier offered complimentary breadsticks and homemade sauce. UMMM! They were so good. I think we found our new pizza spot! We'll definitely be back!","This place is as authentic as it gets for Italian Pizza in Toronto. To be honest I would avoid pizzerias here until I discovered Pizza e pazzi. . I have been to the Wychwood location numerous times and I have never been disappointed. Recently I visited their Corso Italia place with a group of pizza lovers. I had high expectations and let's say they delivered on every bit except the service. . The food was fantastic. I ordered the Diavola as usual. This pizza never fails me. Love the spicy salami and basil with a drizzle of spicy olive oil on top! We also had the crispy calamari appetizer to share. While not the best, it was well cooked and seasoned. . All of us were very satisfied at the end of our meal. Then Lambert ordered the nutella dessert to share. It was amazing. Fried dough drizzled with generous amounts of nutella and powdered sugar. Every bite was heavenly. I was really full but I couldn't stop eating it. All in all a great experience. I wouldn't hesitate to come back with a group again!","My girlfriend and I have ordered pizza / salads from here a few times now and I'd rate it as a solid American style pizza place. . The cheese and toppings are tasty, but the sauce (mainly due to its overabundance) and crust could be improved somewhat. The main reason we continue to occasionally order from here is probably due to their great house salad and home made italian dressing. The salad is loaded up with a large variety of toppings including pepperoni, fresh tomatoes, and an abundance of cheese which when combined with the excellent dressing results in a great side to go along with the average pizza. . Their decision to accept cash only is really annoying and prevents me from ordering from here more often, which is only exacerbated by the fact that everything they sell is really expensive.","I feel like I'm being slightly generous with 3 stars. The house is Absolutley. . . . Gross. The bench seat cushions look extremely dirty and the worst part of all: it literally stinks like a seniors complex full of dirty depends. If my wife and I weren't completely starving then we would have left. . We ordered the pizza which was recommended by the waitress. It tasted like a frozen pizza. Crust was far from fresh. Overall, a bad experience. I'm changing it to 2 stars after writing this.","Excellent pizza!!! Was ready when was supposed too be, and the employees we awesome. I think we found our replacement for north end. The chicken fingers were good too.","I read the reviews and I chose the highest rated Pizza joint in Charlotte, NC. This place did not disappoint. Great NY style pizza in North Carolina.","Delicious pizza! It's as simple as that! Never had a problem with delivery and the pizza is consistent in quality. Just a note: if you order a veggie pizza, don't get the tomatoes it will make the crust extremely soggy! Like literally, water at the bottom of the box. . .","I can't believe this place hasn't gotten a higher rating - probably the best meal I've had in Vegas. Do NOT let the outside of this place fool you - it looks like a straight up bakery but there is restaurant seating in the back. I've been here for both a quick slice of pizza (delicious) as well as a meal with my family. The servers are SO friendly. The ambience isn't anything fancy but the food is wonderful. I got the gnocchi al pesto and I'd go as far as saying it's the best gnocchi (aside from my grandmother's) that I've ever had, and I don't say this about Italian food outside of my family's too often. I'm not sure if the people who have reviewed this have only gotten the pastries and haven't given the actual food a try, but this place is legit as far as I'm concerned.","Fast delivery as promised but I ordered a Sicilian pizza and the crust was just very bland and had absolutely no flavor. My wife stated that it tasted like cardboard, and I would have to agree. Their regular thin crust pizza is just ok, lacks taste. Hoagies soggy. Very overpriced for the quality, unfortunately. . Just seems to be another example of a sub-par, cookie cutter pizza shop. The only thing I have to compliment on is really the sauce. The sauce is actually pretty good. I would recommend going to Primanti Brothers for your pizza desires. I'm very rarely disappointed by their pizza. . Sucks that I have to give such a crappy review, but I have absolutely nothing to rave about. Totinos party pizzas have more flavor. If you haven't already noticed, I feel their food is terrible. That is all.","Stumbled upon this place online and decided to drop in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Ordered a meat lover pizza and bacon pizza with small lentil balls and eech salad. I was definitely enjoyed the food here!. We were given free pickled turnips and chili since it was our first time there. I would come back again.","Yep, like most of the previous yelpers - I did grow up in Chicago and have had my fair share of deep dish pizza. Giordanos is not my first choice when it comes to deep dish but, a friend really wanted to try it so we were game. . This is the first valley location and of course I was very skeptical they could make a true Chicago deep dish here in Phoenix. . Anyway, we had a large group and were seated outside on the patio. Drinks came slowly most of the night but, we were here for pizza so not a deal breaker. . I know deep dish takes time 45 minutes or so and since we ordered several pies I knew it would take longer. After an hour passed, the pizza made it to our tables and looked great. We ordered mushroom and sausage on one and pepperoni on another. Even got a thin crust for the kids. . Overall, the pizza was cheesy goodness. I would say very good but, the canned mushrooms were a bit rubbery and were a bummer. Sausage was great, pepperoni too. Even the thin pizza was tasty. . Service was steady and friendly but, a bit slow at times - especially drinks - may be that's the bartenders fault but, all we ordered was beer, wine or soda - nothing should take 15 minutes to get there when the place is half empty. . Yes, I would eat here again. It's a fair try at a Chicago classic but, there are better even in the valley. Personally, I like to get my deep dish fix when I visit chi-town in the summer.","Service is rude, but pizza is great. Order at least two slices because they are small and will leave you craving more. The pepperoni is the best and I usually order cheese at other places. The pepperoni curls up and get all crispy and delicious. Like little cups to hold the grease. Yum!","We had the Diavola and it was simply the best pizza we have ever enjoyed and we love pizza. We are from out of town and sad this place is so far away but thankful we got to enjoy it. Not to miss!","Way to expensive and the decor needs to be upgraded, you can find much better pizza and pasta at some other locations in the south hills. .","Vapiano is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Everything I've had, whether pizza, pasta, appetizers or dessert, has been equally delicious and well presented. The pasta is made in-house, and other ingredients may be as well. The desserts are off-the-charts, a must try. . There's never any problem finding a seat. The wait for the food is not too shabby and perfectly acceptable as the setting makes for good vibes and plentiful conversation. . If you are looking for a great place to eat at a VERY reasonable price, give Vapiano a try. The negative reviews I've read appear to come from people who have underlying personal issues that create problems everywhere they go. Disregard those comments and go enjoy some good food and a cool dining experience.","The pizza I had was incredible delicious, so much flavour and the waiters was courteous but one of the waiter forgot to provide us with salt and lime for our tequilas shots sigh. . . I found the restaurant a bit too dark even it is in the hotel/mall.","The best buffet in town for cotton candy. Actually, this is probably the only buffet that offers cotton candy in their dessert section. . The food is either bland, cold, or stale. Service is ah-okay. I feel bad for the tourists that come here and pays $30 to eat here. It's not really worth it. . Even though the food was kinda dry, the best dishes they had were the Indian food. Tikka masala, spicy lentil and chicken masala were the best (but no as good as other places). . I also tried the Singapore noodles, kalbi, orange chicken, vegetable roll, chicken fried steak, baked chicken, potato salad, sushi and pizza -- all were very much disappointing. . I would definitely come back, actually, I wouldn't.","Always great, always affordable. Loads of toppings and full of flavour. I usually get this pizza delivered. Very courteous delivery men, quick and efficient. One con:  Ask for well-done crust, because it can come out somewhat doughy.","Absolutely the worst chinese food experience I have ever had. My sister and I were hungry and the only places that deliver near me are chinese and pizza. Wanting Chinese instead we ordered here. They leave their menus on our doors so I thought to try them out. Actually I ordered from them one the 4th of July and had a decent experience but this time my sister ordered the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice. She ate it but was mildly disappointed and I ordered the orange chicken and chow mein. I hate the way they make orange chicken taste and the chow mein was 100% inedible. It tasted like 2 week old rewarmed food. I threw it up the second it entered my mouth. Sorry I would highly recommend avoiding this place altogether even if you've bought from them before.","Excellent Lunch portions just right, wings are different tasteing not for me need more seasoning they are coal fired too would be better if they gave some ranch dressing with them. Overall the service is excellent Our waiter really nice and knowledgeable. The pizza looked too coal fired but was excellent and moist a pleasant taste compared to the traditional pizza establishments.","Awesome pizza! Absolutely love the one topping large special. Usually quick service and very consistent. Wish they didn't charge for their water downed ranch though.","Service was attentive and personable. We sat on patio  and it was lovely. Nice wine selection, pizzas are awesome! I don't think you can go wrong with any of them. Baked eggplant was not my favorite, but I was expecting  more traditional eggplant parmesan and there's is more of a light stew. Overall, great experience!","Really good pizza, with tasty crust and excellent flavor from the sauce.","My friend and I encountered Bannock while on our downtown shopping extravaganza (woo hoo!). SUPERB location!  I'd read great reviews about this relatively new eatery (plus it's Oliver &amp; Bonicini, so how could we go wrong?), so I figured it would be a treat!  Upon entering for lunch, we realized the restaurant was basically split in two - the deli-countered, limited-menu side, and the \"real\" dining area, with extensive, much lauded, renowned-chef-designed Canadian comfort foods menu. It was quite busy, so we decided to hit the deli side for a quick but hopefully delish meal. Atmosphere was friendly, casual, and urban stylish. . At the counter, we ordered and picked up our lunch:  I had wanted the venison chili, but was told they ran out (!)  Okay, switched my order to the Quebec tortiere - a meat pie made of duck and pork. Sounded tantalizing!  My friend ordered the soup of the day - French Onion, and a Caesar salad. After luckily finding a spot by the Queen St. window (always entertaining!), we dug in. Honestly, our meal was a bit of forgettable eats. The tortiere was a disappointing mush of vaguely chicken-like tasting blandness - served with packets of ketchup (!?), and my friend didn't rave about her soup or salad. After being constantly prodded by incoming customers about needing a place to sit, we packed up and left. I WILL give Bannock another chance, though, based on the high ratings at Yelp, and the fabulous downtown location. Perhaps I will do the proper dining area - the snack/deli counter doesn't deserve any special attention!  Can't wait to try the poutine pizza and albacore tuna teriyaki, among other dishes!","Really really good crust with solid toppings. Unlike most places they put the cheese on top of the toppings. That's better for some things though I like my pepperoni and sausage crisped up. . Bread sticks are made in house and delicious. Ownership clearly takes pride in making a good product. As good as you'd want from a neighborhood casual pizza place.","This review is long overdue. This place is on point every single time I dine here. The hospitality and food are both 10 stars!!  The food is always amazing, everything from the Leone Special to pasta to sandwiches to pizza to their delicious desserts. The staff is always accommodating, and goes above and beyond every visit. The one person that makes this place is Lior, the manager. He is always helping his team out, and talks to everyone. He truly cares about his patrons. We had a wonderful Mother's Day today. Him and his team made our experience so special and memorable. Thank you Lior and staff for making everyone who dines with you always feel like they are #1. We love you guys!!","I saw this place while I was walking in south side with a friend. All I wanted was a slice of cheese pizza. I went in and saw it was $4. . I was surprised but bought a slice anyway. When I got the pizza I was like oh that's why it's $4. The pizza was huge and takes up 2 plates. The pizza tasted delicious and the crust is crispy. I enjoyed this small little gem!","Lousy experience. Didn't think you could go wrong ordering a pizza until I ate here. We didn't have to pay for the pizza, and ordered a salad to go. Even the salad was disappointing. Maybe the burgers are good?","I don't really have anything terrible to say about Flamingo. The rooms were recently renovated and very nice. The location was amazing and the price is great. If you are a pool person, Flamingo has one of the nicest pools in Vegas. They also have a great pizza place that is open late for those after bar munchies. My only complaint was that the age demo of hotel guest was a little older than my friends and I, would have been nicer to have a late 20's early 30's crowd. But again, that's not terrible as we could easily walk to other casinos to hang out.","We just tried Sorella's for the first time today, and it was a hit with the whole family. We tried the taco pizza, one with old world pepperoni and onions and a side of the pepperoni bacon bombs. They were all great, lots of flavor. We will be ordering again soon.","Awesome restaurant with a great location right on Capitol square. We were seated quickly on a Friday night!. The decor and vibe is very modern. Everything from the reclaimed wood walls, to the pendant lighting above the bar, to the wallpapered bathrooms really just works. I could take some notes from this place on how to decorate my own home! . Our server was really helpful and outgoing. . Wine list is quite extensive with the cheapest bottles being in the upper $30 range. None of the cocktails really caught my eye so the Bf and I stuck with wine. . We ordered three dishes. This was in no way enough food for the two of us, but we were planning on filling ourselves up on beer and eventually Ian's pizza (just reliving my college days. . . ) later in the night, . We ordered the tuna tartare, which was really refreshing. It was served with rice chips, which didn't add any flavor, but added to the texture! The Pork Belly was mmmm mmm good. No complaints so far. We finished off our meal with the Papardelle, which was creamy and flavorful, but was served a bit too room temperature for my liking, . As a whole, we loved all of our food. Were we full after our meals? No. Was it pricey? Yes. But even with these facts taken into account, I enjoyed the atmosphere, food and service enough to recommend it.","This place has great pizza, wings, beer and is my favorite spot to watch the Pens. Last time I was here I got the white pizza on their pan pizza crust, which was absolutely delicious. I'm also happy with their rotating craft beer list.","Absolutely the best wood fired pizza I have had anywhere hands down. They must have been on their game tonight! I was served the absolute best mushroom and spicy Italian sausage pie I have had in quite a while and called bonita whilst I was served. . . . You can kill me with flattery and your tasty cholesterol any time!!!! The tiramisu is excellent and worth taking a slice home not to share:) Kudos, gents, it's been a wonderful experience and I shall return upon the next visit to Toronto!","This place is adorable, but rather small so do try and make a reservation. I arrived early and lucked out to grab a table, but a lot of folks were turned away by the time I left, or it looked like they may have to wait a bit. . I was in Cleveland for a conference, and not in the mood for anything fussy. I ordered a really lovely original cocktail and the Trento Margarita Pizza. My blood orange cocktail was wonderful, the perfect blend of citrus and bitters, I am sure I would not have been disappointed with any of their options. The pizza was simple and just what I needed. . Anyone reading my reviews knows I'm a fan of great wait staff, this place did not disappoint. She was attentive, answered my various questions, and got me on my way. . Give it a shot, the menu is fantastic!","Pizza is SO SO SO GOOD. Some of the BEST NY style pizza I've had on the west coast. The SAUCE is seasoned, obviously someone's special recipe. Crust is thin but still crispy, yeah you can fold it. Pasta is BOMB also but every time I order I have to get pizza. Try the calzones-pretty damn authentic. It brings back nostalgic tastes of home.","The pizza was really greasy. Ordered a create your own with mushrooms and it came loaded down, which might have been good except it that's all it was, mushrooms. There was practically no cheese or sauce. The cheese pizza is surprisingly not boring with 3 different cheeses on it. The pizzas are big enough to share, if so desired. Hand stretched is a basically a thin crust pizza with a slightly raised crust. They serve Pepsi products and a wide variety of teas. They offer patio dining which would be great if people with shopping bags and scooters didn't walk through it and bump everyone all the time. While it was an ok pizza place next to fashion square we won't go back again.","My family came for a conference and their hotel was near Mall . . we all decided pizza sounded good so we stopped by Mama Gina's . . service was quick and friendly and waitress was attentive to our needs . . . pizza was good and the atmosphere was as friendly and nice as could be . . no complaints at all . . . . The manager came out before we left and checked in with us to see how everything was . . . Worth a stop if you are craving a nice slice of pie . . would recommend sitting outdoors . . it was very comfortable!!","Great pizza !  I think this place is a hidden treasure. Staff are so friendly and the place is spotless. I like it better than el Salvatore's!","I really like this place. My wife and I have visited 3 times and tried the pizza, JVG Burger and Philly Steak Sandwich. All are fantastic, full of flavor (especially the Phiily) and served promptly, fresh and hot. All items are made from scratch. Very good place.","great food - pitas, pizza, wraps - nice friendly neighborhood feel, Dave the owner is friendly and helpful.  try the pesto pizza- without chicken for vegetarians - it's terrific.","Loved the ambience and the appetizer menu is very hard to beat and the pizzas are amazing unique and Italian typical","This place is becoming a standard for me. On Monday nights, I have a rehearsal that goes until 9:30. . . and by the time I'm done, I'm ravenous!  Of late, I've been ordering Manhattan and having it delivered just as I arrive home!. I KNOW it's a pizza place, but their grilled chicken salad is great!! I don't know what they marinate the chicken in, but it's SO tender and moist!  It's a great salad for just $6, or splurge for the large for $8.  (Sidebar. . . when I order the large, I always say I'm going to save half for the next day. That's never happened. ). Along with the salad, I order the Pastrami pizza for my boyfriend. I haven't eaten it myself, but he says it's awesome - and our friends agree. It looks to DIE for. . I'm a pretty picky pizza eater. . . so once I try the actual pizza, I'll re-review, but for now, it's getting 5 stars for convenience and tasty salads!","Can a pizza have too much toppings? Holy bejesus these guys really piled it on my pie yesterday. The current carryout $10 any pizza ($2 for extra cheese or stuffed crust I found out) is a great bargain. . I have to admit, the pepperoni lovers with Italian sausage and mushrooms pan pizza is too rich for me. I actually like bites of just cheese, sauce, and crust when I eat pizza. I am a big fan of the Papa John's down the street with the garlic dipping sauce, but if I am really hungry, this Pizza Hut is the deal. . I ordered online by web because their iPad app didn't have the carryout deal or any other deals (click on deals and you get some message about everyday low pricing and no coupons needed #fail). It was piping hot when I got there to pick up 15 minutes later. Great counter service. . Convenient parking lot behind the store. Carryout or delivery only. No seating.","The vegan pizza was really good :) as well as the vegan ice cream!! My companion ate two garlic knots and she liked them too. We both had a glass of stella draft beer, cold and yummy. Customer service was great, the lady and the guy were friendly. :) I liked this place and I sure will be back soon! . Btw, this place is located inside of the Plaza Hotel, next to the elevators to the garage parking.","This place is perfect if you are looking for a quick sit down restaurant on the Linq strip. Our waiter was so enthusiastic about his job which made our experience even better. The chicken romaine salad was very good, and the Bianco pizza was delicious as well. The next time I'm in the area I'll definitely be stopping by for another bite to eat!","The pizza here has this delicious garlic glaze on it that makes the giant slice of cheese pizza worth it. Not the best pizza ever, but good. I love the chicken tenders though! . They charge for ranch and other sauces though!","I absolutely love Giordano's pizza. The cheese and sauce on all of their pizzas are amazing. So many flavors that blend together perfectly. The restaurant has a great feel and is always full of gappy customers. I was really happy with the drink menu and service when I was there recently. I had a great time waiting for my food that it seemed like no time had passed.","Great pizza and even better service. A bit on the pricey side but you get a large portion. Highly recommend for their wood fired pizzas","Awesome Italian cuisine! Couldn't ask for anything more in a restaurant! Great environment and friendly accommodating staff! Pizza, calamari and the veal dish (scallopini) are to die for. Prosciutto pizza is a definite favourite as well, just ask for it if you cannot find it on the menu. Will return for sure!","Sticky floors . . . check. Loud screaming children . . . . check. Greasy pizza that can take paint off walls . . . check. That's right, your at Chuck E Cheese. It was definitely fun if you go there with a small child and let them run loose, but, I don't think I enjoy that anymore. The only fun machine they had, for me at least, was an old Space Invaders arcade. And, just in case you were wondering, I don't like my pizza greasy anymore (at least not THAT greasy). Actually, my little one didn't like that greasy pizza either. . The games are definitely fun for the kids, and the motorized mouse on the big stage deffinitely brought back some memories for me (it actually didn't squeek and grind as it moved). . The question now is, would I go back? Short answer, mah. Long answer, I can bring my kid to a better play area for the amount of money I had to shell out. Total spent ($61 for a large pizza with one topping and five drinks, plus $10 for tokens). 'Nuf Said","We've ordered from Big Man's for years and have noticed a steady decline in the quality. Tonight they promised delivery in 45 mins but it was 2 hours. We called twice and they said it would be 5 minutes but it wasn't true. When it finally arrived the pizza was cold and the salad was wilted. No credit or discount offered either. We won't be back.","Okay, so far the best pizza I've had since moving to Vegas. Crust is a great texture, with a nice chew. Sauce had nice flavor toppings were fresh. I also had the hot wings and they are also cooked right, big and meaty. On top of all this, the price is right. Best part is, I live right down the street!   Only minus I can see was they didn't have any beer.","Great concept and great fun would be the best words to summarise this but there are some rough edges that need smoothing over. Also why is there no such place in Toronto!!! . Went here as a large group of 24 for a birthday fun evening out, I did not realise at the time but this included the terrible pizza and soft drinks we were provided with afterwards. Before playing dodge ball I did help myself to a hot dog and fries which were okay but be cautious as all that jumping may result in regurgitation. . Anyway the place itself is huge with 3 dodge ball arenas and one fun area and one foam area for people to somersault into, would like to try this out next time. . The game itself is super fun and super tiring, a great way to burn some calories and the hour we had was more than long enough. Do take water and keep it on the platform. . The staff member that kept an eye on us and officiated the dodge ball game was also great. . Only downside would be maybe to provide some arcade machines to kill time when waiting, and also to have nicer and cleaner wash rooms. They were a mess when I went to use them. . Oh yeah on arrival in the arena you will be greeted with the BO smell but you'll soon get used to.","We have eaten there and get take out numerous times. . Their pizzas are awesome. Growlers to go etc. . But today I had my first 2am burger which finally prompted me to write a review. . Wow! This is truly an awesome burger. I'm still in awe. . Their beer is great too.","As a student at Concordia University, I really appreciate having a pizza place near my school and that is so cheap. Pizza is good, shish taouk is good, workers are really efficient, and even though they do not talk a lot of english or french, we can see that they are really trying hard to communicate with us and be nice. . Only reason I do not give this place a 5 star is because it is a bit dirty.","2 hours to get a pizza? Really? On a Monday? And it's not like it's gourmet pizza. . . never again. Worst $30 I have spent in a minute.","Order for pickup, then made to wait because 'someone didn't put in the chocken? WTF? Why bother having an app if your people don't use the system. Plus pizza was mediocre in texture and greasy. Domino's you turned a treat for my grandson into a hot tired extended walk that left most of the people full, but not pleased with what they ate.","Many of the reviews on here are far too exaggerated. I am originally from Chicago and the pizza at Vito's is not even close to what we have there. It is quite a step even below Barro's, which I enjoy but is also not a good representation of Chicago. . I am speaking in regards to their deep dish, which is all that I have tried here. The pizza is not awful. It is pizza and when is pizza ever bad? However, it is nothing special and definitely below average. The prices are very high considering the quality of pizza. We spent over $30 for one pizza and a small side. For that price I expect something a lot better, so I don't think we will be back.","Wish I could give less than 1 star. Worst Pizza Hut delivery experience ever. I understand I'm not spending $50 for pizza, however I live less than 2 miles away and it took them 1. 5 hours to get here. How is that even possible? I checked in with the store after 45 min and they assured me it would be here within 10 min. . . . twice. . . then I gave up. If it was just me, it wouldn't be such a big deal, but when you have guests its matters.","My boyfriend and I went in here a few days ago to see what they replaced Al's with, and we were not disappointed! This place is great! It has a very Subway/Chipolte vibe, with lots of fresh ingredients, and a make it your own philosophy. . We were greeted right away and asked if we had been there before. We said we had not, and they walked us through it all. It was fast, filling, and tasty! I made a BBQ chicken pizza with bacon, and he had a buffalo chicken pizza with bacon. Next time, I think I will try one of the salads! . I love the simplicity of the pricing, and there are no charges for extra cheese, or even adding a second meat. for both of us, drinks included, we paid less than $21. 00!. That is actually less than a lunch at Subway or Chipolte with some of the add ons. . All in all, a great experience! We will definitely be back!","Hit the spot! Perfect amount of sauce for a slice of pizza. I'd go back in a heart beat!","I didn't have high hopes for this place, but was pleasantly surprised. It may be yet another restaurant buried in a condo high-rise, and the name of the place may be uninspired, but it's cute inside and the sausage calabrese pizza is some of the best I've had in a long time.","These guys are great. The pizza is good and the service is fantastic. Mineo's and Aiello's are awesome, but Napoli's does the one thing the other two don't - they deliver. That's been the winning combo many times, and it never disappoints.","A friend and I went to Bannock knowing we would order the duck poutine pizza. The waiter was really descriptive about the pizza, and advised us that it would be more than enough for two. For your average pizza-lovers, he was right. But my friend and I really love pizza and poutine, and were able to devour every last bit of it. . It was delicious and hearty to no end. The hearsay is that usually a party of ~4 will get a pizza to share, and then order individual dishes. We definitely would have done that if we had more people!. For the price ($16 before tax and tip), the poutine pizza is well worth your money. To be honest, I can't say it was mind blowing, but it's definitely deserving of a chance!","Wow truly amazed. My coworker and I were out in Vegas helping a new store open. We were going to stop at chipotle but stumbled upon Grimaldi's. So thankful that we decided to try something new. Great service and wonderful food!!! . The vibe is truly great beautiful restaurant. We created our own pizza and got a house salad. Our server was so nice and I believe the manager brought out our pizza. So excited for the one opening up in California. My coworker had been to New York and said it tasted just like it. Definitely recommend!!","Save your money and go to Olive Garden. . You will get the same quality and \"interpretation\" of Italian without  the feeling or regret after spending so much. . The Linguini with clams was in a pool of butter and oil, but the pasta was all stuck together. It should be illegal to call a pizza of such quality a \"Margarita\", with its flat pita bread crust, thick rubbery cheese and no basil in sight.  . This place highlighted all that is wrong with Americanized Italian food. Greasy, heavy, over cheesed, and over cooked. . The one star is because they had really comfortable chairs.","Cute little house has been converted into a cafe/little bar. The bartender was super nice and greeted us as soon as we walked in. We arrived on a Friday night and there was an acoustic performer that made it feel like a coffee shop. Don't be fooled by that since this place offers a variety of beers and other drinks. Menu ranges from sandwiches, appetizers, and pizza. The pizzas are ok,  nothing great or fancy. The sandwiches weren't bad either. What made it great was the bartender. She was super nice and suggested drinks and food for our group. One thing to remember is you can't tip on your debit or credit card, cash only tip.","Update. Ok so I messed up my online order. I'm old and online means hard. I only finished step four on the order. To send your order you have to finish step five and send order. I may be old but I can still learn. . Now about the food. I heard so much about this place even after hours of failed attempt to order online, I decided to go there and eat. I went on Friday night, not too smart right? Waited 30 min and sat. . I ordered the large meat meat that I failed to get online (cause I'm stupid). I also ordered beer and Italian salad (fam style). . The pizza was amazing. What you read is true, fresh delicious, amazing. I will order that again. One piece is a meal. There is like 8 slices on a large. You are packing that home. . I did not like the salad, just not to my taste. I won't order that again. Also small for a family salad size. Would feed 4 easy. So maybe I'm too picky. . I gave the place four stars cause the salad was not fantastic. If I was rating the pizza alone 5 star. . no. yes . Nothing about the food here. . I have heard how good this place is. So I ordered online the meat meat large deep dish. These take an hour to cook. . I drive 40 min to pick up my pizza, the staff is too busy to assist me right away, too busy talking to other waiters. The place was only 25% full at12:55 on 2-17. Waited 5 min for help. She looks up my order and they don't have an order in the system. . When I ordered online it gave a pick up time and payment amount to pay cash at the store. . She offered to make a pizza but that's an hour wait and 40 back home. So I declined. . If you order online, better call them and verify the order. . May be the best pizza on earth but I'll never know since they can't deliver on there online order.","MEH. . I was first super excited to see that there was a Vapiano in downtown Charlotte having just discovered the one in downtown NYC.  The one in NYC is super chic, always busy, and urban with a downtown vibe. . This one is downtown Charlotte is nice - modern interior &amp; furniture with a patio, large bar and some nice lounge seating. BUT it's a lot more open than the NYC location - no upstairs location, less tables, and less people - that's for sure. You don't get the same busy popping vibe as you would in NYC.  But that's Charlotte for you - this location closes at midnight (MIDNIGHT people, the night doesn't even start until then) and the surrounding bars close around 2, so. . . what can you do. . Also, I ordered the same exact item I ordered from NYC Vapiano at this location - a Bruschetta pizza - but I was severely disappointed with the Charlotte location's. The chef just handed me a cheese pizza. . . with 4 pieces of basil on it. Whaat? That's not bruschetta. . But I'm keeping an open mind and maybe sometime in the future, I'll drop by again and see if they can do any better.","The food is great. We often order the pizza and hoagie special. . I gave three stars because the phone service is TERRIBLE. The past three times I have tried to call to place an order I have been unable to get through on the phone, only to drive to there and find that they had either taken the phone off the hook or were just ignoring the phone all together. I have sat in my car and tried to call and watched them just completely ignore the phone ringing. They make it very difficult to order from them!","Okay - so we tried Strada 241 the other day. I have to say there were some things that they did very well, but they did fall down on the main meal. Decor is hip and casual. Food is largely Pizza, Pastas, Mains and Appetizers/Salad. . Highly recommend calarmari as a starter. The white pizza with potato/rosemary is excellent. My hubby had the pasta with clams BUT the clams were stone cold. He said the pasta itself was good, but when he told the waiter that the clams were stone cold, the waiter went to the kitchen to advise and then -- nothing happened!. What!!??? Really??!! We expected he might come back with warm clams, but no such thing. . It wasn't until the main was over that he came back + said the clams should have been warm - ya think?. I mean, would you eat them being cold -- we worried they had not been cooked properly and no one wants to get sick on bad shellfish. . Anyway the manager did come over and give us some gift card for us to come back and use another time. Not sure how much is on it -- but still not sure about this place -- I mean -- if you didn't impress us the first time -- why would we return. Candidly as a note to the restaurant - it is better to comp someone right there for a screw up. Shows you are investing in the long term dining relationship. . On top of it all meal is not inexpensive. So for (2 people) sharing an appetizer, a couple of mains and 2 glasses of wine with tax and tip -- expect between $75-85.","I am a fan of the vibes here and their appetizers! We got the fried asparagus, cheese curds, and pretzels and they were delicious! However, I would say that their main dishes are eh. Got the pesto pasta and a pizza.","Domino's has ruined my night. I got home late, my delivery had just shown up, the number they had on file didn't know there was a pizza coming. I call the store for FIFTEEN MINUTES, at least TEN TIMES-no answer! Finally they answer their phone and then proceed to tell me the driver was too scared to come back to my house, actual words \"he said it was dark and he felt uncomfortable\" then the manager added the store was about to close, so all in all, my pizza cannot be delivered. I understand the manager cannot make his child of a driver deliver my pizza if he claims to be \"uncomfortable\", so I still want my pizza, and decide to go down myself for my now AT LEAST 20 minute late pizza-mmm, yum. Plus, it'll be nice to put a face to this driver who must be 12-yrs-old. . I get there, no one is up front when they KNEW I was coming! I literally waited three minutes before the driver noticed a customer up front and all he did was call for the manager and go back to the back. Guess what? He looked to be about 35 years old, what the-I'm really trying not to curse throughout this review, but I am LIVID. The manager comes up, looking like he's now the one scared of me, and by the way, this guy looks to be around 18. Not that he's too young to be a manager but he was obviously lacking confidence and intelligence from the whole scenario I'm having with him. . I'm just wondering a few things. Not why they have jobs at all, that would be mean, though the driver really needs to look into a new job if he can't drive to a normal looking neighborhood at night, definitely a poor choice for his career. But I'm also wondering why no one was checking the front more frequently, there was an extremely easily accessible donation jar in my reach the entire time. Someone could easily walk in and walk out. Why my phone calls weren't answered until they were almost closed-actually I was definitely calling longer than 15 minutes. I actually did ask him why they never answered the phone, his response was he was counting the inventory in the walk-in. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? Your phone is ringing repeatedly during the span of a few minutes, you really aren't going to stop and answer?? Or if you couldn't hear it your employee couldn't tell you the phone was ringing REPEATEDLY!!!!!!??!!?!??!???!?!?!!. WHY THE HELL ARE THESE TWO THE ONLY ONES IN THE STORE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!?!?!?!?? -Honestly, all this was just pasted from my Facebook post. . As a follow up, I was able to get a hold of the store's GM this morning to tell him about the FIVE charges I found on my bank account, essentially he solved my problem, refunding the money and also giving my a credit for my next pizza with them, but I was unimpressed by the feel I got from him on the phone. . I really need the DM to be aware that this particular store seems to be falling apart and may need to be checked on. . Names of Domino's staff that \"helped\" me:. Justin-GM. Andre-Manager On Duty. Shane-Driver","Ahhhhh!!! You know those days that fill up so quickly with \"stuff\" that you don't even have time to even think of eating? Yeah, well, the day we went to Jane, I forgot to eat lunch. Oops. And our dinner reservation was at 9pm. Double oops. . (But hello, skinny jeans. . . ). And not taking a cab to Jane at -30 degrees Celsius? How many mistakes can you make in one day!? Snowbanks and heels in the crazy cold. Yeah, I didn't take out my camera for that. Needless to say, when we finally got to the restaurant, we needed our food STAT, we needed it to fill us up, and we definitely needed it to bring us to a warm, happy place. . A total fluke, but Jane was the perfect place for this kind of meal. To begin, my friends had a Caesar salad ($9), which was quite sizeable and quite good. And not swimming in dressing? Amazing! Our luck was changing. We even found little fried potatoes in there. Yum. . They also ordered the crabcakes ($13). I'm not the biggest fan of crabcakes - I rather have just the crab and skip the cake - but they were happy, and enjoyed the cakes' fun spicy kick. . I had the beet salad with melted goat cheese ($11) - big and delicious! Rather than creamy goat cheese spread on the side of the bowl, this salad came with a round cross-section of a goat cheese log. With that were roasted pumpking seeds and arugula. Seriously delicious. . Next, we chose to split the Bianca pizza ($17), made with porcinis, b\u00e9chamel, buffalo mozzarella, parmesan, pesto and truffle oil. I had heard about Jane's pizza crusts and thought to myself, how good can a pizza really crust be? Answer - better than I ever imagined. Instead of the \"thin whole wheat crust\" we're used to ordering to feel less guilty about indulging in this Italian main, our pizza had a bubbly, chewy, doughy and downright decadent pizza crust. Maybe I could compare it to slightly thicker Naan bread? In any case, the entire pizza was rich and luscious. . Finally, we split the brownie ($7) and the cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e ($7) for dessert. Nothing super out of the ordinary, but damn good too. . Jane is small, wood-sy and welcoming. The atmosphere is hip but warm, and the food is all about comfort and taste. It's casual dining at its best. . . Food 8. 5/10, Atmosphere (greatforcatchingupwithfriends) 8/10, Pretty people (althoughseeminglyshort) 8/10, Music (TheXX, Adele, etc) 8. 5/10, Service 8/10. . . Pictures: http://belledenuitmontreal. com/posts/jane/","The only reason I am giving it three stars was because for the price. The food was probably closer to a 4, but at $160, pre-tip, for three people without dessert and only  $45 worth of drinks), it just seemed high. We shared a mushroom pizza for an appetizer. It had a nice crust, good sauce and was actually very good. I had the grilled sea bass over greens, there was also a pasta dish with mushrooms and a shrimp risotto. Everyone liked what they had, though nothing was tremendous. The wait staff was very nice and moved our table when to an outer table that wasn't as noisy as where we had initially sat. I feel bad giving this place a three but price should play a role in how places are rated . . . .","This is the only pizza place I will dine in or order take out from. I'm very picky about what I eat; a total food snob. I love their pizza! I always order their pepperoni and mushroom deep dish pizza!! The servers are always friendly and the prices are very reasonable. You can't go wrong here, everything is good!","The three of us came here for dinner on a Friday evening recently. It was quiet, unlike their sister restaurant Le Richmond which is just next door. Perhaps not many people know that in that fancy European delicatessen looking place sits a lovely, industrial chic Italian bistro with to-die-for lighting fixtures. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and honest. And then came the food. Oh how it was good and generous! My mushroom pizza was exquisite, while my friends' osso bucco was darn pretty to look at (in addition to being delicious). We also tried their gnocchi, which tasted nothing like supermarket gnocchi - a very good sign. Lastly, the cannoli tasted like it was individually made with love. All these at very reasonable prices. Definitely a keeper!","I had someone recommend this place to me and I was so glad that he did. Ever since we have eaten at La Famiglia we have not gone anywhere else for pizza. They sometimes get busy but that's because they are so good. An awesome family run business I think everyone should support plus their food is AMAZING!","This pizza was amazing in my opinion. Not sure where the negative reviews are coming from. Went to buy pizza by the slice at about 11pm the other night and it was quite busy. . so much that they couldn't keep any pizza out. Was nice that we got fresh pizza that hadn't been sitting out. We were staying there at Aria so we took our slices back to our room. After I ate my slice, my mouth watered for more. So much that my husband and I couldn't wait to buy a whole pizza to take home the next day. We got the Gotham pizza. I can't say anything about the other kinds because we didn't try those. The meat was very tasty on the pizza and the crust was really nice. I'm glad I don't live in Vegas because I would be going to this place every week. I definitely look forward to going back on our next visit to Vegas. It is expensive for a whole pizza. . . With tax it came to $34 for a whole Gotham pizza but it was worth it and we enjoyed it very much.","I bought a coupon on Groupon and had zero expectations. I walked in and the place was empty and I told my boyfriend \"this should be interesting\". Man was I wrong. . . . I even decided to ADD the business on Yelp for how fantastic it was!!! It was worth every single bite. We started off with fried calamari and grilled garlic shrimp. Super tasty and fresh; almost melts in your mouth. The main dish was a four cheese thin crust pizza and my boyfriend had the \"all dressed\" pizza. Omg! That's all I will say. The tomato sauce was extremely fresh, the ingredients were \"garden fresh\". Finally, dessert. I'm not a dessert person. At all. I would go back FOR the dessert. The Zeppolli's tasted as though my Grandma made them. Omg food-gasm!!! I'm so glad I bought this Groupon coupon and discovered this hidden gem!","Weeks ago, I had been cruising down Brookline Boulevard and was dismayed that Tisha's Sunny Farms had apparently been displaced by a new restaurant. However, when I noticed that it had been replaced by a Southern eatery, I was intrigued, eagerly anticipating its grand, grand opening. When Mother's Day was upon us, my dear mum exclaimed \"Bama's! Bama's!\" when asked about her meal, and Dad and I took care of the rest. . Bama's interiors are modestly appointed, but their food is anything but, generously served and living large on plates and in bellies. . The beautifully bark-laden (St. Louis?) Pork Ribs (Bama's also offers Beef Ribs) we ordered for our takeout feast might as well have come from a barbecued brontosaurus. Smoked with an exquisite subtlety, succulent as the greatest of steaks, and as fatty and tender as the night is long, the amount of meat on each bone was astonishing and astonishingly appetizing. I almost felt as if they needed no sauce to compliment them, until I got a taste of their stingin' honey mustard and their sassy cherry red \"mild\" sauces, both kicking my taste nodules into orbit with their loud flavors. Bama's taught me love. They taught me to love sweet potatoes, their casserole taking on a pie-like quality that had me wishing I'd saved them for an after-dinner treat. . They taught me to love mac 'n cheese, Bama's being fluffy, ethereal, wigglin', jigglin', and bold with cheddar bite. . Bama's potato salad is a buttery, golden quagmire of savoriness and texture. As a connoisseur of this staple of cookouts and picnics, Bama's ranks as a top 5 contender, pushing Grandma's off to the corner forever. . Again, recalling dessert in the same manner as the Sweet Potato Casserole, the Cornbread Muffins would have fooled me into thinking them to be cupcakes if a cream cheese icing had been applied or a strawberry shortcake if the juicy, crimson fruit and whipped cream accompanied them. Dense and sweet, no condiments were necessary. . This brings us to the proper dessert offerings in the Apple Crisp and the Peach Cobbler. Served in deep cups, the molten, chunky fillings in each were complimented by the kind of sugary, crunchy coating/crust that rules bake sales nationwide and begs for vanilla ice cream. . That Bama's is not yet another Boulevard pizza parlor is commendable. . That Bama's was being deluged by customers when we arrived to pick up our food was encouraging. . That Bama's is serving up supremely tasty Southern cooking in Brookline is a miracle. . P. S. As I write this, my family and I are lethargic from the amount of pork we consumed. Gorged and happy we are, and the leftovers are plentiful, Bama's unsparing portions positively spoiling us.","Just finished up dinner at Fire and Brimstone for the second time and it was another great experience. We had a pizza and a wedge salad which was plenty for 2. After seeing a few of their desserts walk by we decided to try one. The owner and a few of the employees recommended the campfire s'mores nachos, it was incredible! Great food and great staff.","I really enjoyed the new location. I have eaten Mieles' delivery several times now and I have not been disappointed. Last night I had made to order pizza, garlic cheese bread, and salad. Everything came out perfect and my kids inhaled the Pizza!","Was visiting a friend and we ordered pizza delivery from here last night. Let me start by saying, I was so close to giving them 5 stars, so lets go with 4 and a half for now. . The guy who answered the phone was a real Italian, great sign. 'How you doin' with the finest New York accent I heard since my last family reunion. So I replied like any other good (half) Italian would. . . 'how you doin' in my fake Italian accent voice. He was so helpful, told me about all my salad options and their ingredients. He took his time with me, just great customer service all in all. . The pie and salad arrived in exactly 45 minutes. I might pick up next time since my friends apt is so close. That chicken salad with Italian dressing looked so big, but we smashed every delicious morsel. Nice leafy greens and quality ingredients, I will order a salad every time. . The cheese pie (medium) was the best. I can't explain it, just trust me and try it for yourself. It's not a thin crust, but definitely a thinner crust. My only complaint, too small. Two girls could have totally shared a large with no leftovers (we had the munchies). . Anyhoo, great experience all in all, delicious!","I was here for lunch with a small group. The nice-ish toppings on the pizzas, both the wood-fired and the pan, were overwhelmed by the thick, gluey crust mountains. Sort of what you might expect from the pan pizza, but I was disappointed in the crust of the wood-fired pizza. Also, there was a only a shadow of toppings on both pizzas. The music was ridiculously loud for lunch time. . On the plus side: plenty of chic attire and ambience if you want to look around instead of talking. Salads are pretty standard greens with dressing, but they remain the meal's high point. Doesn't add much that is new or interesting to the Madison restaurant scene (though maybe the bar time crowd is the target audience?). . I am, however, a huge fan of Chef Evan. I just wish he was still making his Spanglish-inspired sandwich at 4 &amp; 20.","My new favorite pizza place! Verrazano Pizza not only has delicious, authentic food but the service is stellar. We will be back soon!","if you are looking for a delicious dinner and a hip bar/lounge scene, wienstein and gavino's is the place for you.  the wait staff is helpful, friendly, and attractive.  the menu has plenty of choices (pasta, pizza, and main dishes) for those who want italian.  the crowd is eclectic; we noted a healthy mix of college kids celebrating birthdays, families, and couples. . the gnochi was hearty.  our waiter offered to top it with some mozarella and bake it.  the serving size was more than adequate(!).   my wife had chicken filled with goat cheese and red peppers.  again, her plate had lots of food.  make sure you come hungry!","The staff are soo nice and welcoming! Can't say enough about how great this pizza joint is. One of my favorite places after a long day of work. Highly recommend!","I moved around the corner a few months ago and has been my go-to pizza spot ever since. I can't speak for the other menu items since I haven't tried them, but as far as the pizza goes - can't beat the price for the quality (and quantity) -$7. 50 for an extra large! The wings are good too!. Also, I've had nothing but pleasant experiences with the people working here. They're always friendly and very efficient. Pizzas hot and ready for pickup in 15 min. . . I was first kind of hesitant to try this place out due to the reviews I've read here but I'm so happy that I did . . . Love this place! :)","I want to give 3. 5 stars but ya just can't. I tried this place based on the reviews and the photo of daily deals that they offer. . . which turned out to be old. I was hoping to get a large 14\" for $11 but the new deal for Tuesdays is two larges for $20. (They only have two sizes so large is technically their smallest pizza. ) Anyway, $17 later, we got a 3-topping \"large\" pizza. Nothing else. I was gonna get wings but. . . . The pizza was pretty darn good. Not amazing, just good. About 3. 5 stars good. Would I go there again? Only if there was a deal going on. $11 sounded perfect. Moving on. . The service was friendly and the place is clean. My wife was really happy with it as well so that makes my life better. Unfortunately I will most likely not be going here, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't. It wasn't bad, it's just not for me. And I don't live around here either, so there's that.","A gilbert gem! This place has awesome customer service, ambiance, and food. The sweet potato fires, onion rkngs, milkshakes, fontina burger, and BBQ chicken pizza are my favorites on the menu. . Make sure to visit on your birthday for 10 off your meal!","Veal picatta  is amzing! Alfredo was creamy awesomeness &amp; the pizza is always delicious!","Ordered last weekend. Great chicken, pizza was tasty. Workers were friendly and had a nice experience w everyone. Would def order again.","We went to Via Mercati for Winterlicious 2017 and there prix fix menu was perfect for Italian lunch. For 3 course lunch it's heavy  cause by the end I was full and struggling to complete desert. Salad was perfect with fresh veggies and liked with chilli oil and Parmesan cheese. Fungi pizza was perfectly baked and loved every bite. Best was the chocolate caprese. Every layer of this desert had an almond bed with chocolate filling and tasted really good. All this for 18$ is not bad.","3. 5 stars. . This Godfathers Pizza is attached to Love's Travel Stop. There is a separate entrance at the front or you can enter through the convenient store. The inside is clean and they have plenty of seating. You can order specialty pizzas or create your own. The \"mini\" pizzas are baked, packaged and ready for sale. I was skeptical at first, but they looked fresh and not like they had been sitting there long. The regular size pizzas are made fresh to order so you can always call them ahead of time and place your order so it's ready when you arrive. This is pretty convenient for anyone who is looking to pick up a quick dinner on the way back into town since there aren't many options in the area. This visit I had a \"Cheese Pizza\" (mini) that was priced at $3. 49 before tax. I was happy with the price considering this is a known chain and it is hooked to a gas station, so I thought the prices would be higher. My pizza was hot, fresh and tasted better than average. You have to pay for your food at the Godfathers or Subway registers inside their area, you cannot take the food into the convenient store and pay for it there. They also have calzones, wings and cinnamon streusel for dessert.","We just ordered 2 medium pizza, both were good normal styled pizza's. I was expecting a bit more after reading the revues so I am a bit disappointed. I have not tried anything else but looking at the menu they have many other options and I will be trying something else. I might update my review after trying something else.","I'm brazilian, and food like this is hard to come by in Toronto. Let me explain better- Rio 40 graus is not fuzion high-class cuisine, but it is also not your everyday 'rice and beans' food. The diversity of the menu -  from more ' traditional' dishes to  pasta and pizza -  makes complete sense in a Brazilian restaurant. The quality of the cooking is also really good. . I love the physical space. The service was good but not perfect, but then, we did go in the late afternoon of a weekday.","Pizza was good!  Also ordered an anti-pasta salad, which was good as well. We ordered the meat lovers pizza, which wasn't too greasy. That's a plus in my book. Only thing was, it said meatballs were on it, and I didn't see any on the pizza, but there was a large meat that was sliced, so perhaps those were the meatballs? Anyways, it was good. Want to try the calzones next.","Coming from the Chicago area we were looking for a local restaurant for pizza. So far it's the best pizza in the area. Brisams offers a good menu at fair prices and excellent service. Only downside it's too dark. Needs slightly better ambiance and more inviting entry. This us our local go to restaurant.","Got pizza here before for my first time, just a standard large cheese and pepperoni. While the pizza was excellent, their billing practice needs tweaked. When I saw the total on the register, I pulled out my debit card and suddenly the total went a little higher after the guy saw my card. . . Much higher than just tax. There was an unadvertised fee for using a card that they try to slip in when you aren't looking. Not a good thing to pull on your customers, haven't been back since.","I see this place every time I drive past work so I decided to try it with my boyfriend after church. We ordered an appetizer of garlic knots, I ordered a slice of cheese pizza, and he got Tony R's favorite calzone. The garlic knots were warm and fluffy, definitely homemade and delicious. They brought out the pizza and calzone at the same time after we ate the garlic knots and they were better than expectations! The calzone was loaded and it was perfectly golden. The pizza had a perfect cheese and sauce ratio and was the perfect temperature. They have cute memorabilia and a small but comfy eating area. Definitely would recommend to anyone who wants pizza and definitely coming again, maybe even for take out on a lazy date night.","First impression, we pull up at 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon with several football games being played so you would expect a good size crowd. There was barely any cars in the parking lot and you could hear a pin drop in the place. My wife said this is not a good sign. We decided that since we drove 30 minutes to come here we would stay. We ordered 3 items to share, chicken wings mild charred, pepperoni stuffed fried cheese and a personal pizza. The food did take a long time to come out. The wings were not charred so we sent them back to get charred. They were good once we tried them. The fried cheese was good but wifey doesn't like pesto which they were covered in. A little easier on the sauce on those and they would be perfect. The pizza while greasy had good crust and tasted good. Overall we are glad we stayed, would like to see the place a little busier, this was our first time so maybe just hit an odd time. We will come back as the menu is quite interesting!!","Bites and Brews. . . First thought, food and beer, right? Well the beer list is pretty darn good (too many IPA's as usual), they 'serve good beer not cheap beer' there slogan goes, or something like that. They don't skimp in that category. The food. . . Not much of a choice, pizza, or a couple different sandwiches, that's it. We ordered a large pepperoni and it was pretty good. Nice and thin with a crispy crust, good sauce, and not smothered in it. They could use better, cheese, but overall a solid pizza. The large is also pretty damn big. . I'm sure I will be back, but probably for just drinks. . .","I like this place. The owners are friendly and help out with choices on the menu. The employees are very quick and nice . . My go to's are the vegetarian pizza and the Italian sub. You can order out or sit in. The decor is nice. The prices are fair. . They also have some delicious desserts.","This was my first visit to Lago since it moved from Tremont to the Flats East Bank. The new location has great space, but it much smaller than the old. location. . First bread was served with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and some seasoning. It was definitely a notch above you typical bread service at most restaurants. . My husband and I started with the Sophia pizza which included arugula, mushrooms, cheese and truffle oil. It was absolutely delicious. . I had the tagliatelle with meatballs in a tomato sauce and it was good. The meatballs were pretty large and the pasta was cooked al dente. It was a large portion and I only ate 1/2. . My husband ordered the burger, which was served with homemade chips. It was large and very tasty. It had salami on top and was very filling. . We also splurged for dessert and went for tiramisu. While it was tasty, I don't know that I would describe it as a traditional tiramisu as it lacked a coffee/espresso flavor. The plate featured a salted caramel drizzle, which was delicious. . Overall, it was a terrific meal. Additionally, while parking can be costly, the new Flats East Bank is beautiful and we were able to spend some time walking on the board walk.","@pizzarustica. It's one of the few restaurants, close to the heart of the entertainment district which you can make a reservation at, and inexpensive but good food. . The pizzas were actually quite good. Thin crust, crunchy - with lots of different toppings like smokedn salmon/sour cream, spicy sausage, pineapple and pancetta. They also have the option for a gluten free crust! (I did not see a note on the menu for an extra charge, but I think they charged us $3 for this). It was crunchy and tastey, and no different from the regular crust. . Each pizza was $14 - 16 each. If you're really hungry you could have a whole pizza to yourself, but I think best to share. . They were able to accomodate our big group, the servers were friendly enough, and willing to do group billing. They also had a really good wine list, serving by the glass, 1/2 litre and full bottles. . What I hated was the decor. It felt like a grade school cafeteria with wooden chairs, and plan tables. Everything was the same colour, and the place itself was small. What's also worse was the single stall bathroom, either I felt guilty for taking a long time, or I had to hurry up becuase three other people were waiting behind me. . I'd totally come here for the pizza, but take out - I wouldn't wanto to stay.","Biggest pizza ever! Service was quick and friendly and it was well worth the price. Ordered by phone and it was ready for pick up in less than 30 min.","This is a hard review for me because I used to love going to Crust for lunch every week or so, but the quality has gone down so far that I won't be back for a long time. . My concerns started about a year and a half ago when they began to make the lunch pizza slices in the morning, freeze them, and then heat them up when ordered. Perhaps they did that prior, but the taste was declining so much that one day I asked the bartender about it and was told about the freezing process, so I stopped wasting my money on slices for lunch. Since then I've still gone back for other lunch items but it can be very hit or miss. . . there is just no consistency from one day to the next. The only item worth ordering is the regular NY style pizza, which is still great. The same goes for the service, one day it's amazing and the next day it's just horrible. . My last visit was for a business lunch, and the service was decent, but 2 of the 4 dishes (including my chicken parm) were inedible. Seriously, I have never had a worse piece of chicken in my life; I can't even explain it. It was like cutting through crunchy plastic, and to make matters worse the breadcrumbs were mostly burnt and the entire dish smelled funny, like what a petting zoo smells like. . I truly hope they improve the quality back to what I remember, but honestly most of the time when a business starts going downhill and cutting corners on the quality of food, it doesn't recover. Sorry.","I must say this is a much needed restaurant on the west side of town! They offer the best gluten-free pizza I have had which is such a delight since it's so hard to find decent tasting gluten-free food. It has a fun a nd friendly atmosphere with a great staff. Their salad is also great, not  your typical boring lettuce salad you find at most pizza places. Can't wait for them to start serving beer and alcohol - it will definitely be my new local spot!!","So we have had Barros for the last 10+ years from this spot. Always delivery. We love Barros. We actually went and sat down to eat tonight and it was amazing. . . pizza, wings great keep it up we will be back!","Great casual Italian restaurants in Little Italy. Good place to go with friends and family. Everything is super fresh and well prepared. We end up sharing a bunch of small plates when we go but their pizzas are great too. Caprese salad and gnocchi are not to be missed. Dessert is awesome too, the tiramisu is the best I've had in Montreal. Good wine list as well. Usually boisterous and lively with fairly high noise level.","Pizza, bread and service were very good. The server was very attentive without being annoying. The pizza was pretty oily but very tasty. The bread pieces and dipping sauce were good.","Would give5 stars if they delivered before 2 pm but other than that we love their pizza and wings. We have yet to have a bad experience with this small business.","We had never eaten at this pizzeria before. We had a larger group and I called ahead to see if they could accommodate us. They were very good at getting us in. The waiter was very attentive to our needs. Dos was exactly what you would expect from a restaurant that serves pizza-awesome. The last point that really stuck out was they did not add the gratuity into the bill. Overall a really great experience.","Worst pizza place ever. The pizza slice is very hard to chew. I think they must put it for more than one day. It's cheap but tastes horrible.","Mercatto is a nice, upscale lunch destination for when you're looking for a change from the usual Bay Street food court fare. It's a beautiful restaurant with crystal chandeliers, modern touches, and reliable service. . My personal favourite menu item is the pesto tagliatelle, though it's a bit oily for my taste (even when I requested minimal oil). I will forgive the oil because everything else in it is quite delicious, especially the sundried tomatoes- they're only partially sundried, making them extra tasty. Any of Mercatto's pizzas are also a great bet, and I hear they offer some pretty decent take-out sandwiches at lunch, though I've never tried them myself. . 2 warnings: . 1) this place is insanely busy at lunchtime- expect to wait for a table. Dinner is much quieter. . 2) be prepared to bring the smell of garlic back to your office, because it will stick to your clothes!","Terrible! The delivery took 2 hours. We called to check because we had guests and our 4 year old all asking where our food was. We were told it was almost here but took 25 mins more and it doesn't take 25 mins to drive that distance. The delivery woman was very rude and when we asked if it was hot (it wasnt) she just said angrily, \"you want it or not!?\" Well, we had to feed everybody who was hungry so we took it. Both pizzas were cold as if they had been sitting for a while, yet the crust was undercooked and doughy. How the hell did it take so long to undercook pizzas? Worst of all, all the cannolis were melted and so warm we couldn't serve them. Waste of $50. I want my $ back.","We ordered the White Pizza, Pepperoni and sausage and a cheese pizza. All were fantastic, the white was phenomenal ricotta, garlic and mozzarella tasty and piping hot . Quality ingredients friendly  atmosphere and the staff are awesome friendly . Love the Super Heroes all around . If you want authentic east coast NY/NJ style pizza this place is a must! Oh the cannoli is divine! Definitely will go back again and again!","Tuesday 1040 pizza special. $10. 40 for a large cheese. Too busy guys. 3 things you need to run a restraunt. People, food and equipment. Oven couldn't keep up. Our pizza was raw on the bottom, also thought the dough mixer couldn't keep up. It's called green dough. Not enough time to proof. Whoever came up with this promo should be fired. We will be back.","After spending many nights here this past school year, here are my thoughts. I appreciate that it is 24 hours. The vegetarian grilled cheese is especially delicious and I usually don't like pesto. The vegetarian pizza is also good and I usually don't like olives. I am not a fan of the drinks, especially the coffee/espresso ones. Matcha latte is also a no for me. The teas are a good deal if you're saying for a long time-- $5 and you can get refills. I recommend the dragon pearl jasmine tea but tbh all jasmine teas are great. It can get quite packed at times but all in all a very convenient cafe.","I have only had the pizza via delivery, so I can't speak to the actual store. . The pizza is great. Toppings fresh and a lot of cheese. Make sure you get the sausage because the hunks of meat are enormous and delicious. . Definitely would recommend this establishment!","Absolutely amazing pizza. I am not from the area and was not sure what to expect. I was not disappointed at all. I even had to go back to try another pizza just to make sure they deserved this 5 star review. This place is great and I highly recommend it.","Came here for the $25 Winterlicious Dinner fix prixe. Got the opportunity to try 6 different dishes because I went with another person. For those who don't know what Winterlicious is, it's an event where a set of restaurants offer special set of courses at a cheaper price than regular meals so people can try new restaurants. . I had the Winter Greens and Wheatberries with blue cheese, apples and tarragon. For my main I had the Griddled Pork Shoulder Steak with beer mustard, warm sherried lentils, collard greens, screeched prunes. Finally for dessert I had the Warm Sugar Beet and Chocolate Cake. My friend had the Curried Tamarack Pumpkin Soup, Oyster Mushroom Pizza with gouda cheese and onions, and for dessert she had the Moonshine Pannacotta. . Overall, the meals were pretty good. The pork shoulder was my favourite, not too salty and it was super tender and I loved the subtle additional flavour of the onions, mustard and the greens. The pork basically melted in your mouth. I also enjoyed the pumpkin soup because I love those vegetable thick soups because I haven't had it in a long time and reminds me of a friend who makes excellent squash soup that has almost the same texture. Finally, I enjoyed the mushroom-oyster pizza. I like how the cheese on it was gouda cheese so it was quite different from your typical pizzas and it was freshly made, the crust was thin and crispy. While the actual pizza itself was easy to cut and eat. . I'll definitely be back again to try this place again. The second O&amp;B restaurant that I've ever been to and they don't disappoint!. The service is pretty good, there are a lot of servers and they always seemed to notice when my water was empty or when we finished a dish and took care of it accordingly.","I have the chance to frequent this establishment very often. They have the best stuff pizza I've ever had. Papa John's, Pizza Hut etc. Pale in comparison to what this little restaurante can cook up. There are all  different signature items on the menu. They also do delivery and take out if one desires. They have a very pleasant eating environment on the interior with vintage art and photos from a far gone era. The staff and chefs are amazing and should be complemented at every point of their service. We will definitely be frequenting this establishment for the long term!. Btw. They have Pizza by the slice, Made to order. We also have gelato in a pretty decent bar","Doesn't even deserve the one star. . I don't generally give bad review's, but my experience here was inexcusable. . Service was horrible, with a forced smile from the waitress only when giving us the bill. Waited on table bread for 1 hour, but it never came. Restaurant wasn't busy at all, but our appetizers took 75 minutes to come out. Followed by two flavorless pies with the least amount of toppings possible, even for a Neapolitan style pizza. . Save your money, and stick to the pizzerias that do it best in this city. Queen Margarita, Pizzeria Libretto, etc. .","Booked 2 nights for $95. Did the $20 sandwich at the front desk and asked for complimentary upgrades. Lady at the front desk graciously took the money and said there were no upgrades. Oh well!. Had a jr suite over looking the city, can't complain. A lack of free wifi was also a minus. Opted out of room service and got a $10 off coupon for virtually any shop in the hotel, as part of their going green program. . Saw a sign about a club with dj/music at the SpaceQuest Bar. Went with gf around 12am. . . literally heard crickets. Not a single soul. No DJ, no music, no people. Had low expectations but with the DJ not even bothering to show up. El em ay oh. . Bed was very comfy. Had an assortment of cable tv shows to watch if bored. Went up to a few levels to pool area. Had complimentary spa/gym access so went in for a look. Only one elliptical. There was a nice indoor pool/jacuzzi and massage area. Didn't stay to get molested. . Checked out the women's area. It was off limits but I stayed long enough to know it was the exact same layout. . There's a gift shop, chapel, jewelry shop, and pizza hut from what I can remember. . Also, to get into the garage parking, just head on over to the north tower, go to the valet (don't worry not a single valet around so I wouldn't worry about harassment) and make a left turn and you're at the self park garage. . This deal was pretty good, but I think I'll stay somewhere on the strip next time.","You get a free cheesy garlic bread appetizer if you check in on Yelp, which is fine by me! . The calamari was also very good, more \"octo\"-legs than the ringlets, which is my personal preference. . I got the spicy mango cocktail, with their house made jalapeno tequila. It was delicious, but could have been even more flavorful if slightly less spicy. It's got a very strong kick to it! . We also got the \"bacon blue\" pizza, which was solid. I was a little stuffed at this point to truly enjoy the pizza though. I'm pretty sure I would've liked it more had I not drank so much cocktails before dinner. Whoops!!","I am in love with Joe's FG!  I think that it is probably a little more of an emotion pull than anything else. My hubby and I almost bought a house in Agritopia, the neighboring subdivision. I had dreams of riding a cute turquoise Vespa with my little dog in the basket to Joe's, the coffee shop, and Cosmo dog park. It is SO Pleasantville slash Edward Scissorhand's neighborhood and I love it!  . We have been there many times and always bring out of town and new to town visitors here. It's always a great story and people love that a lot of  the food comes from the farm. Where else can you go that there's a TV in the bathroom showing some strange vintage video cartoon?. My favorite thing on the entire menu is the garlic fries!  They are a must but make sure that EVERYONE in your party at least tries them if they are going to be in close quarters to you for the next several hours. This is especially true if you are going to be driving together!!  Everything else on the menu is great!  Love all the burgers, the pizzas are good, my hubby loves the beet salad, the portabella mushroom sandwich is flavorful and satisfying and if you have a sweet tooth, make sure to try the french toast, peanut butter, banana, chocolate chip, pineapple, strawberry sandwich!!! After that, don't forget your shot of insulin!  The ice cream is okay. . . I'm more of a hand scoop ice cream fan. I haven't had the shake but whenever I go, it seems like everyone else is having one. I prefer to walk next door to the picture perfect coffee shop to get a special bakery treat. . Take your friends, take your kids. Don't go for peace and quiet. This is not a romantic can't see your meal it's so dark restaurant. You go for the atmosphere, you go for the food!","Was fortunate enough to try out their dinner recently. Everything was very good. We tried some salads, pizza, lasagna, pasta with muscles and steak. Great service also.","Been going here for years, the pizza got a little mediocre at one point, and I heard from an insider due to a family issue etc etc. they had let \"THE\" pizza guy go and had peeps with no skills creating the pie's, it showed. Glad to say it's better again, not sure what they did, but its been good. I'm a transplanted NY'er and know my pizza, and they do a rocking basic NY pie, the sicilian is great, for a little over $20 me and my wife get 4 meals out of that thing, a full large pizza box full of goodness! The calzones are also very good and salads are worth the money. The only current bad is the delivery, for a while I just didn't call them, always an 1. 5 hour wait, that's just unacceptable. It's been better as of late and will continue to do business with them","Visited this restraint after watching an afternoon Jays game. Friends and I were trying to find a restaurant to eat at, and after doing a quick shopping session at The Hudson Bay, we noticed Bannock on. m the ground level. No wait at to get a seat for three, and a nice interior area. We ordered the poutine duck pizza as a sharing dish and I had the fish and chips. I was very full, and the food was delicious. Didn't have to wait overly long for our orders to come out too. We didn't order any drinks and our glass of water was constantly refilled throughout. . Would definitely return!","Its a cheap pizza by the slice type place. You can \"dine\" in or out but they dont have a restroom and sent me across the street. (Can you even serve food in a dinning area and not have a restroom?). I wasnt distracted by the flashing lights of the casino and made it back over to buy a slice. I normally love pizza by the slice places as they are quick and easy to carry as you go to your next stop. . This pizza fit those categories but it was made with low quality meat and cheese. Was kinda bummed out with it. . The next time I'm on Fremont st I will definitely find somewhere else to eat.","Great pizza and even better service!  The Aria knows how to train great people that are super nice and friendly. Love this place","Really good go to late night pizza fast delivery. . if your local and you don't feel like driving call them up if you're from out of town and want fast good delivery this is the go to","Last time the pizza was bomb. . . this time it was suuuuper fucking greasy and the bread was so thin you couldn't even lift the slice without it breaking off/sliding . . . lame. . . walked from Ceasars specifically for this slice. . . what a bummer","We ordered very different dishes and everybody was happy: the seafood risotto (half of a lobster tail included!), the pizza, the veal and the gnocchi. We were all happy. We also had tiramisu and OMGsh! Mascarpone was delicious, the lady fingers has just the right amount of expresso. . Please note their system is a little old, so they won't do individual checks. We just split the check 5 ways, that's all.","This place gets it. . Good pizza, good service(this location). They even have the black-and-white cookies for dessert. If they only had a good NYC cheesecake like JR.   But I have to say this place is one of the best in Vegas. Try one of their sandwiches. Forgetaboutit","I have often heard about this place, but I had no idea where it was! When I saw it on the Whitbylicious website, I figured it would be worth a try finally to celebrate my birthday with my husband. . The atmosphere is nice. Dark, but not too dark. Kind of classy, without being pretentious. It was very hot inside, which I can only assume is from the giant wood stove as you first walk in. Wear something light.  . The seating is a little tight. We were kind of jammed into a corner and were surrounded by two groups. Service was friendly and attentive. . We both ordered the same items from the Winterlicious menu:  The appetizers were 3 mini crab cakes which were really nice! The hint of heat made these perfect. They come with a grilled slice of lemon. . For the main course we each had a rare 10 oz ribeye steak with roast potatoes, rapini, carrots and asparagus. My steak was cooked almost perfectly. It was a thin steak, so a couple of spots were closer to medium though. My husband's was mostly medium rare to medium. He let the server know and turned down her offer for a new one. She ended up comping his beer for him instead which was a very nice gesture! The veggies and potatoes were delicious and the steak had great flavour. . For dessert we had the chocolate strawberry tart. So good! Despite looking really rich, it was actually quite light. Perfect after a heavy steak dinner. . We'll definitely be back to try the pizza. It looks amazing!","We've been going to Sabuddy (they tell us it's pronounced \"suh-BUDdy\") for several years, and the place has definitely kept its hometown charm, even as its popularity has increased -- as, necessarily, have its prices, to meet demand. It's still gives you some of the best bang for your buck in town -- some of the best-tasting food, as well as generous quantities of it! The servers are usually pretty friendly, and they will give you recommendations to your taste. We can never eat it all, and always box it up for have delicious leftovers the next day. It beats pizza, burgers, and your usual fare for flavor and healthfulness to be sure!","We haven't been here in about a year since we moved quite a drive away, worth every mile we drove!  I love this place  staff are wonderful, restaurant clean, pizza is amazing and the wings. . . . yum. . . I will never be able to say enough about how good the wings are. I would come once a week if I could.","This pizza joint's signature is serving up huge slices and pies. They're as big or even bigger than the ones served up by Pizza Sola. Unfortunately, the flavor of the pizza doesn't measure up to the size. The crust wasn't very crispy. The end of the crust was pretty much a bread stick. The tomato sauce didn't have much flavor, and the cheese wasn't as savory as I like. . I would rate Benny Fierro's two and a half stars.","My dog has been a giant buttface lately. We go to work and come home to pizza boxes ripped to shreds, Tupperware bitten and bent, and/or trash strewn everywhere. Husband insists that it's the cat, but we all know that's not true because cats are angels and sleep all day when we aren't home, patiently waiting for our arrival to begin purring again. Anyway, the dog has been going batshit crazy being cooped up in the house since she doesn't like going outside when it's cold, also known as the only time we can take her out- morning &amp; evening. Being the nice people we are, we thought we'd be awesome pet parents if we took her on a car ride out to Cosmo's to sniff some new dog butts and stretch those lovely legs of hers. . We ARE awesome pet parents!! The place is pretty huge and Tatum was thrilled. Lots of space for her to run and since we were all the way in Gilbert, as opposed to our normal Scottsdale stomping grounds, she was meeting all sorts of new pups. She wasn't crazy about running in the dirt (did that place once have grass? I would have liked to seen more grass), but she was all over the place anyway. We were really interested to see if Tatum would be interested in the water side of it. The only time she's gone in water was when she was running after a gaggle of geese at Roadrunner Park and lost track of the direction they were escaping to. Turns out, she doesn't mind getting wet up to her chest, but THAT'S IT. We lost a ball to the deep end during her test of endurance. Live and learn. . There were some serious water dogs out there though. Very cool to watch how eagerly they run off the pseudo-pier after the floaty toys their owners toss in. We also enjoyed the stairs and catwalk that the dogs could walk up, across, and down on. There were a few other big things the dogs could climb on that Tatum obliged us with, but I didn't notice much shade and, again, the place had little to no grass so it was pretty dusty. But the pup was pleased and pooped, so that's two puppy paws up!","We love this family owned pizza place!  Friendly staff and owner,  very clean and the pizza is true Italian style not the boring American pizza. And be highly recommend you try the bruschetta, fresh ingredients and full of flavor.","Best kept secret in Las Vegas for artisan style pizza!. Tucked away in a shopping center across from Target, next time you are shopping stop in and order a pizza!!!. You pick your crust, sauce, cheeses, veggies and meats. Great variety of options, so yummy. . I ordered the diavolo (spicy tomato sauce, no joke), mozzarella, pepperoni, mushroom and jalapeno. So good. Couldn't finish it so ate leftovers the next day. The sauce was even better the next day. . My husband created his own BBQ chicken pizza, fantastic as well. . Great for kids as they can really get into creating their own pizza with all the toppings to choose from :) . Staff super friendly and help with topping suggestions if you aren't sure what to get. Their specialty pizzas really good too. . Help get the word out so that they make enough money to stay in business!!! Tell EVERYONE you know to try it out.","I have celiacs disease, and I am usually very nervous about eating at a pizza place. The owner knew exactly what to do so I wouldn't get sick. He prepared just for me a crust-less pizza and GF wings. I am so grateful. I highly recommend!","Worst pizza place in town  If Rocco isn't in the store run the other way. Very inconsistent! Pizza will be burned one day and the next the crust will be under cooked and soupy,  Worth ZERO stars.","My 11 year old saved up babysitting money to order her and her friend pizza and when it arrived the delivery driver told her he was short on change. And did not give her the correct amount of change back.","Terrific restaurant! We've never had a bad meal there; but once we discovered their pizza, which is second to none but Pizzeria Bianco without the drive to a Phoenix and the hour-long wait, it's hard to order anything else. Sapori d'Italia is highly recommended!","We visit Aria pretty regularly as my husband plays in their poker room often so we've been looking forward to this place opening up for a while. Every casino needs a good casual place or two to eat that isn't the coffee shop.  (No, Bellagio, Olives doesn't count. . . ). Anyway, all I can say is that this place is GREAT.  Now, we like a good straightforward cheese pizza, not all the bells and whistles, and theirs was honestly the best pizza either of us have had pretty much anywhere. No lie. This comes mostly from the crust which, on our pizza, was perfect. Crisp on the bottom, yet still chewy, plenty of those great dough bubbles (you know what I'm talking about!), and really flavorful. The sauce was delicious, not too spicy, not too sweet. And the cheese was also perfectly flavorful, not super stringy like you get on a gimmicky cheap pizza, and not totally greasy like. . . well, like on Secret Pizza, a total grease bomb if you ask me. . We had salads, too, and my beet salad was great. Something special, if you want to splurge (which we did).  . The atmosphere was pleasant, no blasting music like you get in some Vegas restaurants now, and there were games going over the bar so it felt comfortable and casual. The service, in our case, was prompt and pleasant. . So, yeah, all around, an emphatic five stars for a pizza place. And I can't wait to go back.","Not bad, pretty standard for a pizza joint. Nothing wowed me here though.  . I came for a quick lunch and service was prompt. Food was typical pizza fare, I had chicken fingers and fries as I was on my own. Everything was tasty and basic. Reasonable price and the food came quickly.  . Best part of it may have been the free WiFi lol","I can't even give this place a proper review because when I came here with my friends they sat us down with the menus and literally ignored us for 40 minutes. We weren't even able to put an order in. We kept on trying to get the attention of the servers walking around but I don't know if they just pretended not to see or they were actually paying that little attention to their guests. It wasn't even that busy. There were only a couple other tables in our area. There were groups of people that came in after us and got their orders taken and drinks served while we were just sitting there waiting for them. Like I work in a restaurant too so it's just mind blowing that you could ignore a table in your section so hard that they sit there for 40 minutes waiting to order. Like if it took 40 minutes for the food to come I could understand that more. But just to take our orders???? We ended up leaving because we were staving and didn't want to wait any longer and just went to get pizza from pizza pizza.","We've ordered from them in the past and it was always good. Expensive, but good. Tonight was a whole different story. The guy who answered the phone was confused, sort of like he was a customer and heard the phone ringing so he grabbed it. The next guy got our address wrong 3 times (there's only 4 numbers in it).  . Food gets here and, well, it just wasn't good. We ordered extra cheese on our pizza and got about 1/2 as much as normal. We ordered wedding soup. I have no idea what it was that we got, but it was gross. It was like some canned chicken broth, little pasta, 3 tiny meatballs, weird green stems and scrambled eggs. Basically yellow swill with green stems floating in it. BLECH!. The pizza that really had no taste was $16. 50. The Giant Eagle throw in the oven pizzas are much better than this was tonight. . I think we'll be crossing Sainatos off of our pizza place list.  $40 is too much to gamble with for pizza.","i just love the customization of seafood you can make. how you want it cooked, what sauce, what rub, what sides. . it's an amazing restaurant with fantastic environment and great service. top 5 restaurant in vegas to me. . along with capriottis and secret pizza at cosmo.","The food here is amazing!  I've taken my wife and kids, coworkers and even business clients here and they all say the same thing, \"The pizza is outstanding!\". I've lived in Europe and have traveled to Italy many times and this pizza is as close as to what I can remember in Milan and Venice. The ingredients are as fresh as can be, no preservatives, and every type of pizza is simple in terms of the ingredients but complex in terms of the taste. So good!  I absolutely recommend this place for a quick bite, a date night, or to have a great family meal. . They even have the non-preservative Coca-Cola (from Mexico) in the glass bottles, as well as the Italian Orange sodas!","My boyfriend and I passed by this place on accident and decided to give it a shot. Here are two factors of a pizza I consider to determine its quality- the sauce and cheese. Wow- the sauce tastes very fresh!! None of that canned crap. The cheese and toppings are no different. Honestly, the bread took me by surprise considering it doesn't 'look' like a traditional pizza crust, but it's well made as you can slightly taste the yeast and softness- important characteristics of bread. I really recommend this place- still dreaming of the sauce!!!","I'm a fan of the teriyaki chicken wings. . . yes, they are fried, but they were crispy deliciousness in my mouth. The meat was fall of the bone tender. The sauce was a leeeetle saltier than I'd like, but obviously not a deal breaker. . Unfortunately, I can't say I absolutely loved the pizza. But WAIT! It's not necessarily their fault! I decided to give free range to my dining companions to choose toppings. We ended up with entirely too many for this thin crust pizza to handle (counting them now, I can recall at least 8). I'd like to go back and give it another try with 2-4 toppings and see how I feel about it. We also tried the jalape\u00f1o poppers - I do not recommend them. Too much breading and bland (tasted like they came frozen from a bag). . So, WHY am giving them 4 stars? FIRST, chicken wings!!! If anything I'll be back for them. SECOND, customer service (the cashier) was friendly and very helpful. THIRD, I can see the pizza has potential and as another reviewer mentioned, the prices are indeed pretty fair.","Came here for dinner because it was close to Hilton Grand Vacation Club. PLUS they had brick oven pizza. We are all about that brick oven pizza! It just taste better. . For starters, we ordered the garlic cheese bread and meatballs. My kids loved the cheese bread. The marinara sauce was also very tasty. It was very flavorful. . The meatballs are made fresh there. The meat taste fresh and the combination of the meat and sauces were on point!. For the pizza, we got the farmhouse, bianca and the calabrese. All three are very good! All I could say is go there and try it, you will not be disappointed. They even sell pizza by the slice. They have a little spot to the left of the restaurant were you can order by the slice. . For the salad, I ordered the arugula and kale with a side of grilled chicken. WOW this salad was amazing. The flavors just burst in your mouth!  YUP I had a tongue-gasm LOL. If you are looking for some good food and inside the LINQ, give these guys a try. Food is reasonably priced too!. OH forgot to mention, customer service here is awesome! Our servers Alex and Luis are super friendly. Supervisor came by and was also friendly. I'll be come back soon!","Just had a ridiculous interaction with Linda, the owner, over a $7 Groupon coupon. Sad really. There are so many pizza places; she needs to appreciate it's the little things that keep customers happy","So I will start this off with I don't like pizza at all!. But Nellos make the best that I have ever tried. I live right around the corner from this place and have always wondered why it was packed well now I know. If you have an opportunity to visit this place you really should I doubt you will be disappointed.","The way I feel about salads is the same way I feel about sandwiches: they just taste so much better when someone else makes them. Am I right?!. Salad lovers, this is your mecca. Fresh ingredients. Long list of salads. Don't see one you like? No worries. You can build your own. And if you don't like that. . . well, there's really no one you can blame but yourself then. I usually go with salmon as my protein. I have to echo fellow Nikki W's comment. . . get it with pesto. (And yes, there are two Nikki W's. Watch out Charlotte). Salads come with a crostini. I usually get a cup of soup with my salad so I can dunk this toasted crouton into it. My orders are usually enough to make two meals. Leftovers rule!. I go to yoga. For any of you that know me, you know I go a lot. After evening classes, I'm usually wiped out and a hot, sweaty mess. This place is so convenient to pop in and grab a salad or sandwich to go. . This location also has some pizzas on the menu. I haven't tried those yet. I can't bring myself to order a pizza at a salad place. . Only small problem is the parking situation in this area. Make sure you pay attention to where you are parking and obey all the signs. They do boot cars if you park in the wrong spot. You have been warned.","This is a brunch review. . Stumbled upon Lil Baci. We happened to be in Leslieville trying to snag a table at Lady Marmalade. . . unfortunately for us, the line up was out the door and we were not in the mood to wait in the cold. Our closest option was lil baci. Neither of us had been so we decided to be adventurous and try a new spot.  . I ordered an espresso, paper plane, and buttered brioche. My wife ordered the french toast, coffee and raspberry lemonade mimosa. The waiter said they were out of the buttered brioche. After asking what vegetarian options, I was directed to the margherita pizza, mushroom pizza or eggplant sandwich. . . . not the best options for brunch but who can turn down a pizza, right?!?. The service was good. The staff was attentive and checked in frequently. . When our meal arrived, they both looked great. I just asked my wife what she thought about her french toast, she described it as \"the compote and fresh cream sweetened things up, but, the french toast lacked some more traditional flavors you'd expect (cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla. . . ). As far as the mimosa, it tasted like mostly proseco with not much raspeberry lemonade. \" . Now for my meal, I can't complain about the mushroom pizza. As I mentioned, I originally ordered the buttered brioche but when this was not available was directed to two pizza options and a sandwich. The server suggested the funghi was a little different. The crust was really crispy and it did taste good, but, more of a consolation choice for a vegetarian eating breakfast. I'd suggest another option for vegetarians. . . . the paper plane was delicious. . Ok meal for the sake of filling up. . . . likely wouldn't return as it is not very vegetarian friendly.","This place is so good I love the pizza and my husband loved the meatball sandwich!! The service is great cashier Logan was so polite good job!!","Was driving by this plaza one day and noticed a sign for pizza advertising a great price for a large. Pulled in. I normally go just around the other side of this building (in the same plaza) and get a pizza from Amici's, but thought that I'd give this place a try. . I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised. . I don't know whether the owners are trying to attract business, but the value for the price is amazing. Generous toppings. . . and fresh. . Have been back 2 other times since my initial visit and have been happy with every pizza.","I love this place for Chicken and potato wedges (fries?) I've never actually had the pizza because we always get a bunch of chicken and potatoes because the chicken is so good! It's moist, crunchy and flavorful. We always get the combo with coleslaw and salad. The coleslaw is good, chopped pretty fine, and the salad is typical iceberg pizzeria salad with dressing packets and lots of mozzarella cheese on top.","Last night we ordered from this location, my pizza had hair in it. This is after the delivery guy attempted to hold on to $20 in a tip and we had to gang up on him to get it back. Then when they redelivered the pizza over 30 mins later,  it still came with hair. I think it's absolutely ridiculous and nasty for kitchen workers not to wear gloves or hairnets and still deal with cash. This location and the workers are disgusting and they should be closed down before they get someone really sick.","This is my go to spot for pizza because it's so close to me. I always get just plain cheese and it's amazing. If you make a plain pizza good then you princely make everything else great. The only complaint I have is I ALWAYS ALWAYS ask for extra side on my wings because I like them wet and they always come dry. Carry out special  is 7. 00 for a large 1 topping.","A nice location and pleasant atmosphere. Service started very well, but went downhill fast. . We started both appetizer specials of the day.  . The first - deep fried meatballs - was okay; nothing to write home about. We later added them to our entrees, and they felt like they belonged better there. . The second - a selection of 2 each of their popular appetizers -was a mixed bag. Fried mozarella sticks and fried ravioli were both tasty. Calamari was soggy and limp. The real problem was the shared dipping sauce which was just plain bland and boring. Adding crushed chili peppers gave it a bit of a bite, but it was still a losing cause. Squirting fresh lemon on the calamari did nothing to help the taste and just made them soggier. . . The main course was spaghetti bolognese (we asked, and they substituted fettuccine) and this dish was just adequate. It felt like they had added too much cream to the red sauce, and it was smooth and orange, instead of lumpy and bright red. I hate to say this, but the bolognese sauce at even the Olive Garden is much better. After we'd started eating, the waitress came over and apologized that she had forgotten to bring us our salad. She offered to pack it to go, but we declined.  . After we'd finished, we just waited and waited and waited. We piled our dirty dishes in an effort to neaten our table, but no one approached us to clear the dishes, offer us dessert or coffee. The restaurant was not particularly busy and we could see the two waitresses standing in the kitchen watching the cooks at work. About 20 mins after we had finished, we were finally able to catch the attention of the maitre d' who finally summoned one of the waitresses for us. . Terrible service notwithstanding, the food itself was simply too bland and boring to consider giving this place another chance. A pizza being carried to another table looked tempting, but not enough to warrant another roll of the dice.","Not sure what these positive reviewers had. . . but we had the worst pizza ever here. It was literally bread and cheese, we hardly had any sauce. Wanted to like this place since it's close but nope won't be going back","I stopped in tonight for a quick bite, and was definitely impressed. I like to think of myself as a pizza specialist. . . and their thin crust, whole wheat pizza's are primo! Bueno!. We started with the prosciutto and parmesano- and the portion size (shared between 2 people) was too large to finish. . . . We ordered a diovala and margarita; both pizza's were delicious, light, not overly filling and heavy/oily like some of the late night joints in the Queen West area.  . A good place to take the fam, bank on good pizza and simple food. . Also- our waiter Micho was hilarious and really on his game- great service!. Overall, I would go back. Not the place you throw back patrone at, but perfect for a good social dinner with friends/family.","Okay this pizza ROCKS!  We always have to order 2 pizza's because my husband does not like my creation. I do a double ricotta, spinach, fresh tomatoes, and it is amazing!  One time I waited a bit for the food, they were very busy and the manager came to deliver it, comped the pizza AND gave me a cert. for a free one. . . . . seriously who does that!  Loyal customer here. We are getting it tonight. Sometimes they offer some good coupons in the mail, they can be pricey, but well worth it. Wed. kids eat free.","I love this restaurant! I eat here a few times a month. I always order the Philly Cheesesteaks. They're the best I've ever had! They have good pizza, fries and wings as well. Everything I've ordered has been delicious, the prices are good, it's delivered on time and the service is great.","Why has no one opened a decent pizza place around here before? This place is brilliant--they've got to be making money hand over fist. The pizza is GOOD. And it's exactly what one wants after a night in Vegas. Over a four-day stay, we came here five times (ordered at the counter and munched our pizza on the way to where ever we were off to). I kid you not. And we will be back.","This is a really nice space that is in a neighbourhood that definitely needs more restaurant love. My friend and I went in early (6pm) on a Thursday, and were seated immediately. It did get quite busy later though. The interior is lovely and cosy, with lots of large, spacious booths. We were kid- free that day, but it seemed like it would be a great place for families. The vibe is fantastic -  classy but laid back, with super friendly service. Even though it was quite busy when we left, we were not rushed out at all (we were still ordering drinks well after our food was finished).  . We shared the olive tray to start and it was really tasty and served warm. We followed this with wood-oven pizza, which was GREAT.  They also had lots of pasta options on the menu, and unlike some other places, they aren't fussy about people making substitutions on the pizza toppings. Prices were moderate and completely fair for the level of quality and service. I will most definitely come back here.","Only giving it 2 stars because the pizza was good. A special was written on the outside board, but when I asked about it they said it was no longer available. Ordered garlic knots and pizza and only pizza was brought out. No plates and no garlic knots. When the pizza was brought out, we were asked if we wanted garlic bread instead, without any explanation. Decided not to get garlic bread. Hubby went next door to get doughnuts to take home with us, while we were waiting for our food. They wouldn't allow us to bring a dozen doughnuts in. The bathrooms were a mess with no soap and the service wasn't good. We won't be returning.","I live literally two blocks from this place and have heard rave reviews from my boyfriends brother. So we decided to give it a try. We got mixed results. However, it was never great. We get take-out a lot. The wings are small and soggy, not crispy. The pizza is decent but has a weird almost cookie-like textured crust, which is not to my liking. The sauce is weird too. I remembered I ordered a chicken breast Philly cheese steak sandwich one time and by the time I got it home, I realize it was a half a roll with two dried up pieces of chicken, some onions and peppers, and no cheese. I usually don't get upset but I was pissed. There wasn't a lot of fries with my order either.  $9 for a piece of stale bread and dried up meat. We don't order from there any more. Rounders on Blue Diamond is a little further from us but well worth the drive.  . Home Plate is a fun little bar with lots of games and great atmosphere and a fun menu. It gets really smoky, however, and the menu doesn't seem to deliver. Everything looks good but disappoints in the end.","I ordered delivery from here for a lot of people (4 pies). The service was good (fast and the pizzas were really hot when they got to us), and the price was low. The pizzas were not that great though. I'd order from here again for a big group, but if I'm just getting one pie, I'd go somewhere else.","One of our favorite places. Love the pizza! Service is always great. Shout out to Justin and Zach - you guys are great and a true asset to this location. . We will be sure to make it in time again for Happy Hour. 3:30-5:30","I usually don't order from pizza hut. It's expensive compared to others. Sorry I did -  what a waste of money. I ordered a thin crust that had very little cheese , was cold, looked like it sat around on a shelf for awhile. Won't be ordering from them again.","Can't beat the pizza! Darn good and you can buy by the slice to mix it up.","The menu here is good, especially compared to your typical bar. The boneless wings are my go-to and they are everything I could dream of and more. I go with honey BBQ sauce and it hits the spot every time. They also do a good job of taking traditional bar foods like pizza, burgers, and sandwiches and giving them a unique twist. . It gets kind of loud in here so don't plan to go here for dinner if you want to have any kind of real conversations. . When I was here in the winter, it was super cold inside their dining area. They had a fireplace heater, but it didn't help much. . The summer is nice because they have a great patio. . I think local is a great addition to the Southside and helps balance out all the shady dive bars on East Carson. Not so great if you want a place just for dinner, but if you want some good drinks too, it's definitely a keeper.","Polo's is in a strip mall across from the infamous Pedro's Mexican food. There were an increasing number of cars rolling up as I got there so I knew it would be good. . The interior is sparse and lackluster, sort of a banquet hall feel for some reason. It was clean but missed the charm some how. . The staff was very nice and helpful, they appeared to be short a person or not prepared for the large crowd. . I scanned every ones plates while walking to the bar and saw a nice mix match of entrees. Pizza, pasta, salads, hoagies etc. It all looked good. . I choose the 7 inch Margherita and a salad with blue cheese. The pizza is a wood fires thin crust cooked to perfection. Topped with mozz and basil. The sauce was a tomato based but has decent flavor. It was a little salty but I liked it. The cheese was a little thin in places but it worked, the basil was haphazardly tossed to one slice of the 7 inch pizza but meh it is only basil. The pizza was good but not as good as Pizza A Metros. I hated to compare but I did. . The salad was large for a side, with romaine, mushrooms, red pepper and tomato's The dressing was blue cheese but not a thick type it was a thin coating of a nice flavored dressing. . The bottles sprite I had was flat, odd but still was OK. . I would go back if in the area but there were also several other little places in the strip mall to check out first.","This bar was tucked away off the main strip but it is worth the detour!!!!! The food was absolutely amazing! Make sure you get the breadsticks and the lil mini pizza. The sauce was very good. The portions are HUGE!!!! The loaded fries sure were loaded and the fries were fresh cut!!!! Do not miss this spot if you are in south side!","Love coming to this location. It's the only one I like to come too. The service is amazing and the pizza is great. Every time I go Lucy gives exceptional service. I would highly recommend this location. Ask for Lucy!","Amazing chocolate Italian ice, best since I lived back east. Next time I will try the pizza or a sandwich, they look very good.","This pizza makes my mouth moist. . . I love it. I also like the fact that I can go get curbside pickup in my sweatpants. The one time I ate inside, the waiter was very nice and offered to let is try this garlic dressing stuff; it was absolutely fantastic.","Good pizza, kids love this place, no real healthy options. Cesar with chicken was overdressed","One thing a hungry girl should never forget - if the restaurant is empty (it was lunch hour nonetheless) there is a reason!  I dined all alone at Piccadilly Freemont - and not because I'm a lonely thirty-something spinster!  Well, I guess I am a lonely thirty-something spinster - but that's not why I dined alone. Trust me, this joint was empty for good reason.  . This place is just awful. I don't know what brand of frozen pizza they toss in the microwave to serve their patrons, but I can assure you it's on the low-end of the freezer-section pizza spectrum. I ordered the $5. 99 special - 2 cheese slices and a 16 oz soda and it seemed like a bargain until I got my food. I looked at those puffy, pitiful, slices of pizza  crusted over with a few shreds of cheese, and my heart sank. Moments like these make me pause and wish I was more of an outspoken trouble maker. I wish I had the nerve to thrust my chin forward and demand my money back. However, since I am about as spineless as a gummy bear that's been sitting in the sun for an hour, I took my sad little lunch and ate all whilst plotting my yelp revenge.  . They couldn't even get my diet coke right. The 16 oz cup was filled to the brim with ice and perhaps 3 sips of soda. How very disappointing. I expected better Freemont street!  Well, not really. I guess I should have known I was strolling down the boulevard of tourist traps. I'm ashamed that, as a local Las Vegan, I didn't have the sense to keep on strolling. . Do yourself a favor folks, skip this joint. It's a waste of calories!","So we ordered some drinks at the bar and bought some slices of pizza to enjoy as a snack only to be told that you can't eat slices at the bar. Why didn't you say that before we ordered. Can't stand job worths!! .","Last week, two of my closest friends moved across the street from this place;  a proper introduction followed mere days later. I can hardly say I was surprised. . This is the kind of place I know I will be happy to have in the immediate vicinity of my second home. The seating area feels nice and open, casual, but (with its fancy, subtle dimness) just pretty enough to make you feel classy when you sit and drink coffee for hours using their wireless internet (in theory, as I have not done this yet). . Yeah, I said classy AND internet. This just might be an appropriate evolution for our maturing group's choice of local hangout (haha). . All I have sampled thus far is their pizza, and it was damn good; good enough to assume that for the initial stages of our relationship, I won't be able to tell you much about the rest of the menu.","We had a terrific lunch here yesterday. The pizza has a great crispy bottom and tender middle, and sauce and cheese are perfect. Got the garlic knots and meatballs for appetizers and they were really fantastic as well. A new favorite place for us and well worth our trip to Fountain Hills. Thanks Redendo's!!","Love the pizza and wings! Honey hot and the teriyaki wings are my favorite. Friendly service every time you go in, and good delivery service! One of the best pizza spots in the area! They usually have specials too, so I always ask before I order.","We have been here several times but this is my first review on the place. . The atmosphere is pretty loud  so don't expect intimacy if you are on a date. There was almost no wait to be seated and we had a lovely server named Aaron who was speedy and polite. We ordered a strawberry lime cider which tastes amazing!  Not too overpowering but just right. Our appetizer of choice was the calamari which is just average. Let's be honest though, it's a pizza bar so would you really expect to have amazing calamari ?. We asked for a pizza to go (half pepperoni and half cheese) Aaron was gracious enough to leave it in the front so we can just grab the pizza and go. This place is definitely one of the better pizza places to eat at in Vegas. . Sidebar: I was walking with the pizza in my hand like a professional asshole and the wind blew my pie face down on the damn sidewalk. Luckily, the pizza stayed intact and we devoured it once we hit the room!","This location is the best one in Vegas. . great salad bar and I always loved to order my personal pizza. . friendly staff-thanks Espy. . you're awesome!","Happy Mothers Day at Hob Nobs! Bloody Mary's, Mimosa, coffee, and nomlicious food! Yes I made that word up. The margarita pizza - add avocado and balsamic reduction was so good we were full and still ate the whole thing. Perfect weather and beautiful to sit on the patio. Our moms even got roses as a nice surprise!","The best pizza I've had in Calgary! I got it for delivery on a busy Saturday night and it arrived in 30 minutes. Great pizza, service and prices!","It's great to see places like this popping up in the neighbourhood but I was disappointed with the quality of the food. You can find fantastic Italian food everywhere in Toronto so I guess I was expecting a lot. But if I'm going out for pizza or pasta, it needs to hit the mark. The pizza here was pretty terrible. . .  just tasteless dry dough. . .  and my bf had lamb ragout pasta, and yeah the portion was big but all we could taste was garlic. Maybe we shouldn't have chosen pizza or pasta at this Italian pizza &amp; pasta restaurant. . Everyone seems to be blown away so far. . . . . is it just because we're so happy to have something in the neighbourhood other than GBK and the food court at gerrard square mall? well played Aprile Bambina, well played. . .","This pizza shop came highly recommended by many fellow yelpers on my Gluten Free thread so I dined here today. I chose to build my own pizza. Gluten free crust, crushed red tomatoes for the base, mozzarella cheese, sundried tomatoes, garlic, crispy basil &amp; pineapple. WOW was I impressed. The guy behind the register also informed me they would be getting a much better gluten free crust next week, and I even thought this one was great! So happy this place was recommended it was Delish! I even ate my whole pie. . . Haha","I am a loyal customer that has followed Corrado from his Danforth location to Cosburn and now will drive from Scarborough all the way to his new downtown location. . From the first time I met Charlie and his Family they all treated my wife and I like we were part of their Family. After a few years, it does feel like Family now. . The pizza is the best pizza in the GTA and worth to drive a distance for. The rice balls and they are big, are delicious. Also have tried the poutine and other menu items. Nothing has disappointed my wife and I yet. . Corrado and his staff are friendly, gracious and welcome their customers with open arms. Just as important is the food is fantastic and the prices are very reasonable. You get a good amount of food with your orders so come hungry!","We had a white sauce pizza that was very good with a delicious \"just right\" thin crust. This place does crust well! Nice house made sangria. Great people watching from the patio. My wait staff were very friendly and attentive. The Kale salad with artichoke and mushrooms and pine nuts was so good I came back for another the next day for lunch!","amazing pizza, great prices, fun for dine in and great for take out. . I always get the original crust pizza with italian sausage and eggplant and ricotta. . . IT'S TOO GOOD!. I would probably die if this left my neighborhood","I've been wanting to try this place for a while because I saw all the good reviews and the pictures looked fantastic. I came here for a to go lunch order. I was surprised at how nice the restaurant was inside. Sometimes pizza places like that are really old school. They had their menu on a tv for a nice view. . I got the lunch special. Two slices of cheese pizza and a drink for about $4. 60. I paid an extra . 50 cents for each slice to add toppings to it. I got ham and beef. They don't skimp on the toppings so it's worth it! I couldn't help but also get the sicilian slice with pepperoni. Pepperoni had a good spice to it. Sicilian slice was fluffy and thick. Two regular slices were huge. I could only finish one slice. Pizza sauce was so delicious. . I can't wait to go back. Great lunch specials and awesome food!!","I've missed Chicago style deep dish pizza since moving from there to Arizona, and Giordano's didn't disappoint. The pizza tasted exactly like I remembered it! It is great to have this taste of home right here in Peoria. My girlfriend and I enjoyed every bite, and we can't wait to go back again soon.","I just had my daughter's 2nd birthday here and it was amazing! They checked us in quickly and had the kids jumping around right away! Everything was set up and ready for pizzas and drinks! It was just what I wanted! Fun with out any stress! Everyone had a blast and my 7 year old is begging to have her party here as well. Shout out to Lizzy, our party host! She was awesome!","Spicy Pickle is a semi-regular lunch stop for me. It's close to the office, and until last week, I could snag covered parking. No more, now all the formerly open spots are \"reserved\". Drat. I've only had one thing here, the \"Classico Pizzetti\", which is a complicated way of saying \"pepperoni pizza\". It's very thin and very fresh, and suits my appetite just right. The crust is great and there's something about the seasoning in the sauce that hits the spot for me. Someday I'll get adventurous and order something else from the menu.","We went to this location to try out the pizzas as we often like to try different places out. We ordered 2 large pepperoni's 1 large cheese and a stuffed pizza. Overall they were good, a bit pricey but it was a nice change of pace.","I recently ordered pizza from here and I really enjoyed it ! A bit pricier than your every day chain like dominoes but worth the extra money. Wood oven pizza with very flavourful cheese and toppings , you can't go wrong ! I did not wait long for my order to arrive and my pizza was hot when I got it which was great . I've tried a few different pizzas of theirs  but my favourite is the four cheese. I've heard the princess pizza is also excellent . I haven't yet been to the location itself so I am not sure if there is any sit down dining but I can say I was very satisfied with my experience ordering in. My only complain was that they don't have much if anything in the way of side dishes but the pizza is so good it makes up for it. I look forward to ordering from here again .","This is an awesome place! The pizza is thin, crispy, cheesy and delicious. The specials are incredible everyday. If you are in the area try this place you will not be disappointed. . . :) Great","Home plate has great hamburgers especially the greek burger but their prices are a little high on most of their stuff expect to pay $25 + for 2 people. The garlic knotts are also very good but I would pass on the jalapenio poppers next time not very good and deffinately not worth the money, the pizza is also pretty skimpy but tastes good.","Think of bannock as Canadian comfort food. Mac + cheese, hearty soups and sandwiches, pizzas, venison+rabbit, pot pies etc. They also have a cafe area where you can get treats, sandwiches and salads to go and coffee. . There are healthy options on the menu but you'll be hard pressed to order it when seeing the other choices. Unfortunatley, the food itself is just mediocre, which I have become accustomed to at most O&amp;B chains. I do suggest trying the duck poutine pizza, but do not suggest ordering this for yourself, unless you feel like you want to eat 2 days worth of calorie intake in one meal. This is essentially a mountain of poutine with duck meat, curds and fries on top of pizza crust. It's literally overwhelming, but hits the \"little fat man in me\" spot. I don't need to have another one. . . They do have a \"nasty sauce\" option that is intriguing, however. . I'd return to bannock as a good, quick, sit-down lunch option.","Love Streets of New York! They've got great pizza and great subs and this location has great service. Very cozy, casual, just a great place to grab a bite, a drink and unwind. They have lots of different pizza options, including gluten-free! I happen to enjoy thin crust, which they do offer. . Their wings are pretty good too, and they bring out some delicious galric knots to munch on. Often I'll place an order for a veggie sub, which is toasted, and it's very large and filling. . You can't go wrong :)","It was OK. . . . My boyfriend and I came for a late lunch on a Friday. This was my first time here, and I wasn't impressed. This was a sports bar type if place that serves salad, pizza, and wings. The pizza was OK (could have had way better at IVP). . Ok. . . I understand that places are trying to be innovative with cooking styles, and making different things. . . . However, they should at least give you the option of condiments. We asked for hot sauce for the wings, and we were SHUT DOWN! I also felt rushed throughout the entire meal. . . . Probably won't go back in this lifetime. . .","Finally!. The long vacant Professional Building in downtown Phoenix has new life. Once the home of Valley National Bank, in the current form this 1932 deco gem houses a Hilton Garden Inn and the subject of this review: Nook. . Whether you are visiting from near or far, Nook is one of the brightest spots downtown. Enter through the Hotel Lobby and you are reminded of a bygone era. One that is rarely seen in the Phoenix landscape. The hotel itself is great, but what Nook did in their corner is modern without losing the classic charm of the space, truly an exercise in class. . We were pressed for time, with a show at the Herberger. Our server Corey, was spot on. Once he knew our challenge, he helped us quickly (and under the happy hour wire!) choose items from the drink, bruschetta and pizza menus. He was efficient, friendly and quick to make sure Mom was taken care of first and foremost. (Dear Manager, he was GREAT). . Our choices: . *disclaimer, I referred to the menu to provide the ingredients.  :). Fig jam, prosciutto, goat cheese and asparagus bruschetta. This was my personal favorite. The salty meat and sweet fig were a great pair. The addition of the asparagus and goat cheese kept the other tasty bits from overpowering and boring the pallet. . . Short rib bruschetta (with mushroom duxelle, malbec demi-reduction and cotija cheese. . . ) was another table favorite. Before heading to Nook, I read a couple reviews and one mentioned how great this was, we were not disappointed.  . Our pizza was a bianco with prosciutto. Mozzerella, parmesan, olive oil and arugula. The crust was light and entirely edible. . . Literally to the the crust, which in my case is often left on the plate. . Though we were on a short time window, the close proximity to the theatre afforded us one more indulgence. . . . Affogato. This incarnation has a chocolate pudding with chocolate crumbles, lemon gelato and is of course topped with espresso. In our case, the manager delivered it to the table, exclaiming \"affogato!\" as he drowned the sweets in espresso. Well played Signore!. All were exceptional choices. I can hardly wait to try everything else!. While I hate to reveal this secret, I want it to become a downtown staple. . . So join me, in enjoying Nook.","I have no idea why anyone would give this place a bad review. The delivery driver couldn't be nicer, the salad was perfectly fresh (and you can choose your toppings), the homemade Italian dressing is delish, and the provolone cheese they use is a nice change from bland mozzarella. . I'm surprised at reviews that say the pizza crust is too greasy - ours was perfectly done. We look forward to ordering again. Thanks!","I'm not a huge fan of gas stations in general, but this place is quite lovely!. The owner is a nice Indian man, and basically is always there. He is constantly cracking jokes, mostly at the expense of the cashiers, sometimes the customers. . The selection of stuff here is pretty solid, and covers some of the finer goods that one may not expect from a gas station. For example, bananas, string cheese, coconut water, protein shakes, and even personal pan pizzas! Make sure you give everything a good look before getting something regrettable like potato chips :)","The carry out pizzas at this location is great!  Full of flavor, plenty of toppings. . . . great staff. . I will order from this Zeppe's again for sure. . The specialty Trio Rocks!","I went in and got a slice to go. While I was waiting for my slice of pizza I noticed they didn't seem to have any sense of urgency. They were very laid-back. I took my pizza home and honestly it wasn't any better than Little Caesars. The pizza was just ok.","Super excited this place is finally open. Not only that, but it was just as good as I had hoped it would be. Tons of good things to say about the place, but I'll start with the two negatives so we can get that out of the way. . The waitress heard me say cheese pizza instead of goat cheese pizza. Probably my fault actually, because it was loud and I am a self-proclaimed mumbler. This mistake was fixed promptly and the pesto goat cheese pizza was awesome. Second problem was that the fried asparagus was somewhat whelming. It was really big, so if you're going for size great, but smaller spears aren't woody textured like the big spears. I assume that since they specify they use local when they can, that this problem will remedy itself once asparagus comes into season in a few weeks around here. . Now for the mega good stuff:. Deadhead double red is probably THE BEST red ale I've ever had. It is strong, spicy, flavorful and full bodied. Just wonderful!  Everyone at my table liked their other flavors (and we went with some beer snobs ;)  The hubby loved, loved, loved the coffee glazed rib-eye. Service was surprisingly good granted that it was the first weekend they were open. The people getting bad service in the other review. . . sorry, we must've been hogging all the attention ;).  . We actually liked the place so much we went back for brunch on the next day. Which was even. more. amazing. . Ordered the swordfish tacos (see pics) and Cuban sandwich, and the french toast (see pics) for the munchkin. The kids French toast was ridiculously awesome. Here's the most awesome kicker- we were with a big group with 4 kids and the back room was open, so they gave it to us to have our brunch back there so the kids wouldn't bother anyone else. It was an awesome experience and the whole staff was soooo super nice. Make sure to check out my food pics- the kids meal was 1/3 eaten when I took the pic, but you can imagine the thrill in junior's eyes when he saw what he got for breakfast! :). Awesome place guys!  Keep up the good work!","This place is Pizza Nova. Not hidden beside Pizza Nova as some people think! I have been eating here a couple of times a year since my youth, many many years ago. I have always liked the pizza here but now I am older I enjoy the new menu. The client hasn't changed much though. Still local Scarberians wearing sweatpants, lol.","Just returned from scaddabush and don't usually write a review for anything but felt compelled to do so today! I am from a city that is predominantly Italian and have eaten many different pizzas but the \"butcher\" pizza I had tonight was the best I have ever tasted. . . . . I loved the thin crust and it was very flavourful. The naked mozzarella was absolutely delicious and we watched as they made it. . . . very interesting!  I also need to comment on our waitress, Amada C. She was exceptionally friendly and very accommodating. I would give her 5 stars as well. We will definitely come back on our next visit to TO.","When I was a kid, I used to look forward to Friday night pizza parties at the local pizza parlor. Since moving to Arizona, I haven't found many pizza parlors here that mirror my childhood experience. That is, until I found Upper Crust. Upper Crust sneaks up on you. Literally. It's located in a small strip mall just off of the 101 and Cave Creek Road but the second you walk inside, it's a whole little sports bar/pizza parlor experience. To the right of the restaurant sits a dining room complete with red checkered tablecloths and family style tables. To the left sits a bar with at least a dozen flat screen TVs, several high top tables and a large bar top. It's the perfect spot to watch a game. . The pizza is outstanding. It's large and in charge! One slice is probably the size of 2-3 regular size pizzas. It's thin crust with soft bread, gooey cheese and any toppings you want. This is the ideal Friday night pizza. If you're ever in the area, visit this hidden gem for some delectable pizza!","Saw Train and The Fray last night. The good:. -Parking was fairly straightforward and free. When arriving, we took Loop 101 south, then Thomas east to 83rd south. Absolutely no traffic problems at 5:30 on a weekday. Much better than trying to fight rush hour on I-10 west. Getting out of the lot took about 10 minutes as we were parked right next to the west gate. . -Sound system was perfect. We were in section 204 and everything was crystal clear. Decent view of the stage for this large of a venue. This was my first time here. I prefer venues like Marquee and Club Red which are much smaller, but for big time national acts Desert Sky does the job. . -Concession and bathroom lines were almost nonexistent. Though based on the crowd composition I'm going to take a guess and say the women's room line was much longer than the men's room ;) . The bad:. -Concession prices are out of this world. Plan on spending $11-15 PER BEER (!), $6 for a 1 liter water, and about $9-12 for an entree food item (I had a personal size pepperoni pizza which was decent, but not $9 decent). You're much better off pregaming somewhere else before coming to the show. This bullet point loses two stars alone. Vegetarian options are spartan: looked like just cheese pizza, a black bean burger, and a loaded nachos, plus a few other snack type items. . -Some of the seating sections carry 60+ seats in a row, so it takes some work if you need to get out of the section from the middle seats. . -The two outside sections and the very back of the seating areas are not under the overhang, so take this into consideration if you're coming to a daytime show. . Would I come back? Yes, if there was a band I *really* wanted to see. But I would do my eating and drinking elsewhere for one third of the price.","This pizza joint offers a lunch buffet which I TRIED to have last week. I stopped in at 12:15 or so. No buffet. I asked the person working at the front about it and she said they were running behind and would have it out soon. So i sat down to wait a bit. After 10-15 minutes it was clear no buffet soon. So i went a few doors down to Bobbie O's BBQ and had their as usual great pulled pork sandwich. . I had to walk past this place on the way back to my car 20 minutes later. Looked in the window. Still no buffet. . So if I could, i would give no stars because i was unable to even try it.  . Judge for yourself.","Family ate here tonight. . . had a deluxe 9\" pizza. . . had to have been store bought the nuked by this place. . . first time eating here. . . won't again. . . i can say the salads and sandwiches are pretty good. . . don't get the pizza. . .","This review is for their take-out pizza only. You have the option to order a slice to go, a whole pizza/meal to go, or sit down and eat at their restaurant. We came around 11am on a Sunday, and were able to order a slice of pizza right away. It takes less than 5 minutes for them to reheat it in the oven for you, and we tried:. -Gotham (Pepperoni, Sausage, Salami, Mozzarella, Granda Padano, $5. 50/slice, http://www. yelp. com/biz_photos/five50-pizza-bar-las-vegas?select=hwQ-MReChXZc4K0EQBWN5Q#hwQ-MReChXZc4K0EQBWN5Q): Really salty. I wish they did a plain sausage and cheese by the slice since it was the pepperoni and salami that were salty. I wouldn't get this combination again. . -Forager (White Sauce, Mushrooms, Bacon, Whipped Ricotta, Spinach): Sadly, this was bland, and I wouldn't get this again. . -Special of the Day: BBQ Pulled Pork: This was the best out of the three pizzas. The bbq sauce was good, and the pulled pork tender. I would recommend this if they had it as a special again. . -Vegas Root Beer Float (Vanilla Ice Cream, Caramel, Butterfinger Crumbles, Boylan's Root Beer, $9): Good, but you only get a small cup for the price. I don't think I would order it again for $9. . Overall, you can get decent pizza here for a quick meal, but it won't be that cheap. The crust is pretty thin at least, but I didn't like most of their pre-made combinations, so most likely won't return.","I used to love Pizza Hut. It used to be my one and only pizza place, but ever since moving into this neighborhood, I've had nothing but terrible pizza, so I switched to Papa Johns (!). The pizza ends up really thin and greasy; there's really nothing to it. What a waste. Plus, they don't do the stuffed crust pizza promos that other Pizza Huts do. . . so, this place is just a lose-lose. Gross, awful, and expensive. Plus, the delivery drivers ALWAYS CALL YOU BEFORE THEY'VE ARRIVED, which means they're expecting you to meet them at the door, and they're not even there yet!  At least I don't waste money on tips?. After four months of Papa Johns, I thought to myself, \"That Pizza Hut couldn't have been THAT bad, \" so I tried it again. Someone tell me how to get this gross, greasy taste out of my mouth. . In short, even if you like Pizza Hut, stay away. This place is the worst Pizza Hut I've ever ordered from.","This is the best pizza in Oakland. That is saying a lot because there are several good places in the area. Since the location is a bit away from the center of Oakland, this place can get very busy for dining in. I have found the best time to go is about 1pm on weekdays. The hospital people usually fill the place at 11am and the office types jam the place at noon. If your going to eat there, make it a late lunch. . My only complaint is the location and like another reviewer has stated, they don't often deliver.","We tried this place while on vacation to Chicago and loved it, so we were excited to see one open near us. The deep dish pizza is just as good as I remember it being- the sauce was flavorful and the the crust had a biscuit type flavor. They brought us the wrong pizza and kept messing up our order, however our waitress was very accommodating and gave us our whole meal for free including drinks and a new pizza. Since it's a new restaurant they are a little scattered but we will definitely be back.","$5 martinis for happy hour. I loved the key lime. Goat cheese spinach pizza is crave worthy. We had the chicken lettuce wraps and zucchini sticks. The food is delicious. Fresh drinks and nice atmosphere.","I found this place from Yelp and it did not let me down. We got the beef and chicken combo with garlic naan. SO GOOD. We also got the chicken hummus pizza (not on the menu). It was also so so good. We loved the jalape\u00f1o cilantro hummus! Definitely will be coming back.","Yo Bevo, I'm giving you two stars. If this review is too harsh, please keep in mind that it is being  written on the toilet, your $25 pizza forcibly removing itself from my body. . . The place is nice, excellent ambience, and initially I was completely happy with the meal. This feeling of satisfaction deserted me as soon as the food arrived. Not only was my pizza not what I ordered, it was completely mediocre. I would have complained, but I was in a professional  setting and didn't want to make a fuss. The crust was dry, and totally flavourless. Toppings meh. I found myself wishing I was in another place, eating another pizza. I also wished that my bill wasn't $25. . . I came home unsatisfied, knowing I wasn't going to return. I wouldn't have cared enough to write this review if the experience hadn't stayed with me. I'm fairly confident that your pizza is responsible for my gastrointestinal distress as others had exactly what I ate that day minus what I ordered.","Not a bad place at all! Stopped by with some friends and tried everything from a calamari appetizer to clam linguine and pad thai entrees to thin crust pizza to-go to name a few. Some plates offered large portions and the food was good, (however nothing to rave about). Prices seem to be in the moderate to a little pricey range. Staff was friendly. Atmosphere seemed to be of a slightly classy sports bar, and they had a good band come in which was nice on a Saturday evening. . Definitely a 3. 5 star place that I'd possibly visit again if in the area, I'm just not rounding up since there was an incident where they wrongly charged tax on to-go food and the attempt to remedy the situation was confusing and left me with overpaying.","Best five cheese pizza in Pittsburgh!!! The white sauce &amp; feta are scrumptious!! We love the delivery gentleman even more!!!","Gryfe's is a *really* small bakery located on Bathurst Street. Their baked goods menu is limited to bagels, other rolls (I think), and mini pizzas. Those said items are all amazing!!!  The bagels are slightly sweet and salty at the same time, and then pizzas are really good as well. It is definitely the place to go on a day you are making brunch, because you can pick up your bagels, and they also sell other brunch necessities such as orange juice, cream cheese and smoked salmon. . My only complaint is that it's $7. 20 for a dozen bagels, and that sort of seems a bit pricy. Also, they are cash only; they don't have a debit or credit card machine. Other then that, I'm definitely a fan!","This place has been around for 15 yrs. I'm a big fan of New York style pizza and this place does a great job. Plus they add a little butter on the crust at the end to to top it off. They have lots of choices on there menu and a great drink selection. This place is worth checking out.","Charlotte is trying with their airport food but it's still not great. This place is new since the last time I was there and it got the job done. Fast pizza and Stromboli at a reasonable price. The Stromboli was very good and did the trick for holding me over until I got home. They're big enough to split and it's a good spot for airport people watching (my favorite travel pastime).","This place is great for Bachelor Parties, and as I would imagine, anything else a well. We had a 4 bedroom suite that was really one suite that has 3 adjoining rooms. . As mentioned, there was a huge projection screen, and all of the amenities were nice. it even had your name on the screen (at least the name of the person who booked the reservation) everytime you turned on the TV. . There were plenty of towels, soaps, and shampoos for our two night stay and service was never an issue. There was a full kitchen which did not have an oven however, which made it difficult to cook our frozen pizzas late night. . All in all a great place and I would definitely stay here again!","Everything is a la carte, thus a bit pricey. Chocolate peanut butter mousse cake was delicious. Artisan pepperoni flatbread pizza was very good but greasy. Arugula salad with goat cheese, hazelnuts, &amp; raisins good but strange dressing. Brussels sprouts with bacon &amp; red pepper flakes -different. Huge portions of chicken Parmesan. Waitress said they could be shared but did not mention size when ordered.","Cool space with excellent pizza. We also loved the stuffed peppers and pork wings!  Service was weird. They kept seating other people before us, then we didn't have a server for a good 15 minutes. Front of house was really not great. Good food, though!","I had a late lunch here recently and while the food was great, as usual, the service was a bit lacking. I arrived at 12:50 pm and no one was there to seat me and no one approached until the telephone started ringing and a man rushed up to answer it and take a pizza order, all while I stood there unacknowledged. I guess the way to get noticed at Humble Pie is to call. . The server forgot to bring my companion's water and I had to ask for silverware and a napkin. My companion asked for hot pepper for her pizza but it was never delivered. After the food came, she got up and got the pepper for herself. In general, we just didn't feel that the restaurant was paying that much attention to us.  . Getting poor service at a late lunch is something has happened to me before at various restaurants (e. g. , Bistro 24 at the Ritz Carlton; Arizona Biltmore) and I wonder if the staff sort of \"lets down\" after the lunch rush and late diners don't get much attention. I'm not sure.  . Would I come back here? Yes, probably, because the menu is good.","Best pizza I've had in a long time. Love the selection of craft beers and the staff is great","I've searched the world for the perfect pepperoni pizza. I've searched it over and over again. Damn it man!  I've wasted my life searching and searching to the farthest corners of the earth to find that saucy cheesy meaty delite!  Only to find that my favorite pepperoni pizza will always be Barro's,  a restaurant just around the corner from where I grew up.",".",". I loathe you, you tasty cheesy bastards. . . oh, and can I have a large pepperoni to go?","If you're looking for mediocre pasta dishes and minestrone soup featuring canned vegetables and thawed meatballs then you've found the right place. On a number of occasions I've had decent Italian food at their older location at Scottsdale/Carefree Highway but at their new establishment the owners have hired cooking staff that serve substandard Italian fare. Louie and his wife need to be sampling what's cooking in their new kitchen. For now, stick with their pizzas and salads.","We were visiting Toronto and had a wonderful dinner at Shoto the last time we were here, so we decided to try brand new Kojin. Ultimately we were very impressed with our meal, and the service was spectacular. My boyfriend said he felt like a King, and while it is somewhat expected at this price point, we thought the service went above and beyond. My boyfriend is half Columbian, so we were also excited to try what we guessed to be some Columbian inspired dishes. . We started with grilled clams and corn flatbread with Niagara ham and cherries. I thought that the cherries worked exceptionally well with the ham, and the chewy ham on top of the cheesy warm bread made everything come alive. I had strong memories of comfort food and it reminded me affectionately of really good deep dish pizza! That was surprising but amazing. My boyfriend loves the salsa it came with and we started putting it on everything we ate during the meal as we were offered a second helping. We were also offered more bread as we decimated the first piece because we also ate that with the clams. While we really liked the clams, we both felt it needed a little something more. The flavor of the clams was overpowered by a ragu inside and needed a sharper note. I also did not taste the grilled component as much. . Next we had dry aged ribeye with Tita' s mash and zuchinni which our server had advised would be a nice balance and it was. We LOVED the steak, but the cook was slightly uneven, somewhere around medium well. I would have preferred it less done, but we were not asked how we would like it cooked. The zuchinni was also slightly salty but had a fantastic grilled flavor that we loved. . Lastly we had blueberry cobbler with earl grey tea. Our server lovingly presented the cobbler by finishing presentation at the table. What a beautiful spectacle, this had all seated next to us watching in awe. I would say if you want to finish your meal with a special touch, please order this. They said this would feed two but we think it could easily feed four. It was not traditonal cobbler but like a creamy corn cake. It reminded me of a sweet corn dish my family made but with tart blueberry compote. The tea was the best I've ever had. . Really great overall, and the staff truly made it a special experience for us.","The pizza and wings are both quite tasty. Very good prices and nice atmosphere too. The service was slow, but there was a huge event in the area that may have caught them off guard.","We checked out the yelp reviews before ordering for delivery tonight. Although there were a few very bad reviews we decided to give it a shot. That was a mistake. . We waited an hour and a half for an order that was estimated to be delivered at 40-50 minutes. At already over an hour, we checked the tracker to find our food had been cooked for over an hour and had yet to be delivered. . Finally we got our food and not only was the delivery driver was rude, our food was completely cold. . Wasted 30 dollars on cold mediocre pizza and terrible customer service. Don't order from this location.","Good pizza, the dough was good with a nice chew. The calzones are huge. The waitstaff were attentive. Duke's just opened in this location? The beer selection was o. k. , Sam Adams winter ale was the only decent beer on tap, but the do offer bottled beer. I will return!","This place is full of germs and got me sick. The restaurant is filthy and the manager needs to scrub the place and get a more sanitary system for serving food. I wash my hands before I eat every time, but think about how many dirty hands touch the pizza server handle. This is disgusting, you grab the handle and then go eat pizza with those hands. I wish I thought about this before they got me sick. Do yourself a favor &amp; use a napkin to hold the handle. Better yet, get Papa Johns instead, it's way better.","These people are rude. I ordered my pizza online, got a message saying it's ready, went to pick it up and noone greeted me. At all!! I stood there at the register and they didn't even acknowledge I was there. A customer came in after me and the lady looked around me to help HIM and still didn't acknowledge me! It took them 40 minutes to get my pizza out, which was cold! I counted 5 people came in and were greeted, ordered and got there pizzas BEFORE mine! Horrible. . I did call to express my disappointment and they gave me a credit.","The food is just bad. You can buy a cheap frozen pizza at the store and get a better tasting one. Burgers are generally dry and nachos are a tasteless mess with canned cheese spread. . If you're with a group don't bother going to the bar for a drink. I was told that I had to wait for my waitress to take my order at my table - that made it 25 minutes for just a beverage. Half price special on drinks only applies to those with alcohol - what if you don't drink. Seems a bit unfair. . Too many other neighborhood places with good food to waste your time at any PT's location.","A gem hidden in the busy South Side of Pittsburgh, this bar and restraunt lies hidden off of East Carson Street. I placed a to go order for their turkey club pizza, but did have a chance to check out the place when I picked it up, and have to say that I really liked it; 4-6 small tables on the left wall with a long traditional wooden bar on the right (with dining seating further back), it felt cozy and very welcoming. The crowd was a very interesting mix, some elderly folks enjoying a meal, some young couples on dates, and even a few ladies out for the night, but not at all the collegiate atmosphere that usually accompanies dining in the south side. Now to the main event: the pizza! Wow, was it delicious! Loaded with cheese, lettuce, turkey, and bacon, on top of a thin layer of tomato sauce, it more than impressed me (for those familiar, it tasted like a delicious turkey Devonshire sandwich)! After 2 slices I was full and satisfied, leaving me with another meal for the next day. I lived this dish and will definitely be trying another one of their specialty pies!","I've been to this bar a few times---and never been impressed by any of them. The beers are good, but very over-priced. I've heard the cocktails are good, but I'm not willing to wait 15 min to get the bartender's attention to find out. (Please note, the long wait time is not because they are busy. ). The food lacks imagination and is mostly bar fare---pizzas, etc. . The patio is nice but, if the wind is blowing the wrong way, it might smell eerily similar to the dumpster right next to it. The location is probably the best part and I find myself there only because I have several friends in the area, and they enjoy going to a bar that they can walk to.","My wife and I noticed this place the last time we went to Settler's Ridge for a movie and agreed to check it out on our next date night, which was last night. . The atmosphere is ok, but nothing special. For a place whose specialty is coal-fired cuisine, I was hoping for something a little more homey. . Our waitress was friendly and checked in on us frequently. Also the place was pretty packed, and yet we got our food VERY fast. The service overall was definitely above average. . We got an order of the wings, which came with caramelized onions and focaccia bread. No sauce, no spices, just coal-fired chicken wings. Excellent! We hogged them down as fast as we could. . The pizza was good. I liked it a little more than my wife did, but even I was hoping for it to be better. We got half with baby meatballs and half with prosciutto. The crust was tasty, and the toppings were good. The cheese and seasonings, though, were a little on the bland side. Again, good, but not as good as I had hoped. . If you're at Settler's Ridge and looking for a place to relax and nosh before walking the 40-50 yards, or so, to catch a movie, Anthony's will do the trick. If you're looking for a kick-butt pie that'll make your eyes roll back into your head, go elsewhere. I absolutely recommend their wings, though.","My first time stopping in I only bought some tea on a hot summer today, but noted that it smelled great if I ever stopped by if I was hungry. My second time nearby I had a pepperoni pizza and it was quite good! Greasy, but tasty! On food alone, I'd give it 4 stars, But, based on how accommodating the staff was I have to give it 5 stars! Other notes: small interior with a few outdoor tables","I've ordered so many things from this place since I started working in the area about a year ago. I love that they have so many options to choose from since they're one of very few places that deliver (other than pizza) and the only one that's consistently on time with my food. I only have 30 minutes for lunch, so getting my order in a timely manner is pretty important. I wouldn't say that the food in phenomenal, but it's pretty decent and I've never been disappointed.","I crave the Mexican pizza with chorizo. Soooo delicious.   . The seasoning on the chips is great,  too.","I give G&amp;B a 3 and 1/2 stars. Their servers deserve a 5-they are always welcoming, attentive and pretty cool!  Although their menu has improved since they opened it still is nowhere near the unique, fresh and interesting food  served at their other establishments. . I will recommend the salmon burger and my husband is a fan of their homemade sausage pizza. The bluegill is nothing special and there are no sides except coleslaw or pickle that accompany most dishes. I was excited when I heard they were opening gut breakfast on the weekends but we were underwhelmed. High prices for typical breakfast fare. . If they start adding more locally sourced fresh options I think they would attract more customers.","We ordered Chicken Marsala without mushrooms. What was served was a chicken breast covered in brown gravy. We also had the \"homemade lasagna\". It had layers of gray pureed meat with ricatta cheese. The noodles were tough and rubbery. We also had beef ravioli which also had this pureed gray meat inside, served with the toughest unseasoned meatballs I have ever had. The sauce was meh. I looked around the restaurant and noticed that most everyone had pizzas or sandwiches. I can understand why. If you go there stick with that. I am Italian and it was an insult to try to eat those entrees (which we did not).","Solid pizza. Nothing mind blowing but I do enjoy the Neopolitan style as opposed to the fake cheese overload (don't get me wrong there's a time and place for that kind too) but it's close to home and I do enjoy it in the summer. Can be a little bare on the toppings - it's a bit too centralised in the middle - I prefer a more even distribution! Beautiful decor. Lovely patio in the summer. It's a small resto so be aware at peak times you may have to wait for a table. Love that they deliver. Great Caesar salad. I find the service a little lacklustre (have been 3-4 times); considering it's such a small place I've really had to wave them down in order to get attention. So if they improve that, get a little more generous with their toppings then we're all good! I'd give it a 3. 5 if half stars were allowed but I'm gonna bump it up to 4 because I want this place to succeed and i wish them success!","came in for an impromptu dinner. I had really high hopes for the pizza as I had heard it was yummy!! we had an awesome server, Sheena, who was kind, filled with energy and flair (because she had blue hair!) she consistently checked in on us despite having several tables. she definitely helped give an extra star to this review. . now for the food: we had deviled eggs and cheese curds for appetizers, which were both standard good. as far as entrees they offer pizza, burgers and salads. we ordered a pizza, (having heard it was delicious) - half hawaiian-style \"mahalo\" and half \"dances with goats\" which included artichoke, corn, feta, onions and tomatoes and supposedly goat cheese. didn't find much cheese of any kind on either half of the pie. and unfortunately, both seemed to be lacking basic seasoning as well. the sourdough crust however, was good. there's definitely potential there for great food. . . the ambience is nice and they also had live music. will probably go back to try a burger and see if it was just an \"off\" night in the pizza department.","Excellent American food and very friendly staff! Delicious thin crust pizza and fish tacos. Yummy fresh spinach dip. Family friendly with a nice patio, and reasonable prices.","Awesome pizza! Authentic taste and great service. Great vibe. Didn't wait long for our food. Wings were delicious. We will be back for more.","Benny Fierro's is a chain of pizza shops from Virginia who has recently opened up a location on the bad pizza gauntlet known as East Carson Street. You probably won't recognize the name Benny Fierro's because each location that they open is given its own specific generic Italian mobster last name. This place is definitely new and it shows. . I tried to call in an order but \"the ringer was broken\". When you walk in the door you are greeted by a really hilarious mixture of bad art motifs. . . on one side there is a huge mural or what if I can remember correctly was some kind of crazy animal, I an not sure if the mural is unfinished or just bad. On the other wall they seem to be going with the random antique/tin sign on the wall motif. . . the cross country skis and canoe must be on back order.  . When browsing the menu at Benny Hoffa's a certain question comes to mind which is \"where is the menu?\" There is no menu because Benny only offers pizza. . . which only comes in one size. . . which is comically over-sized. . . . cut in 8. . . . . which costs 30 dollars for a cheese pie. Unfortunately this is a gimmick pizza shop, which is a shame because the pizza is actually pretty close to being good were it not so terribly inconvenient. . . The pizzas at Benny Bagadonuts are made in a brick deck oven but unfortunately they use screens underneath them while cooking so the dough ends up a bit raw in spots underneath the sauce. The middle of the pies are so paper thin that the dough can't really hold the toppings so you end up pretty much being forced to eat the pizza with a fork and knife or to fold it in half. At about halfway up the slice the dough starts to even out to an appropriate amount. The crust of the pies are super thick and puffy and almost hard to eat. . . I almost didn't eat the crust, which is usually one of my favorite parts of a pizza. The cheese distribution on the pie would be perfect if the middle wasn't as thin, the cheese was evenly distributed and pulled all the way to the edge of the crust. The sauce was somewhat ample and distributed pretty well across the pie as well. The pizza could have been cooked a bit longer and was still pretty soft on the bottom. If they didn't insist on having such a puffy crust than they could flatten it a bit and actually have a bottom thick enough to support everything. . . One thing that stands out about the pizza here is the dough, which I think has a lot more fat in it than most Pittsburgh shops. Benny Buttafuoco's dough has a nice bready fatty salty taste to it which helps it achieve some sort of crunch despite being made on screens. I'm not sure if they are using shortening, butter, lard or what but it definitely is a lot more rich than the dough found in most shops around here. The dough has a somewhat medium density, not too dense but definitely lacking the fermentation to make it nice and bubbly. I would be super curious to try their dough cooked directly on the brick but I can't imagine anyone that works there being able to slide a pie that large off of a peel (or a peel that big even existing). In general the dough has a great taste with a mediocre consistency.  . I think Benny is using mostly mozzarella cheese although it almost tastes like there is a hint of muenster in there too. The cheese is high quality and melts well without charring. . Benny Mascarpone's sauce is fine. They are using decent tomatoes and the consistency is a medium thickness which is pretty desirable for me. The taste is slightly one dimensional. . . and the dimension is garlic. It's not an offensive amount of garlic I just wish that I could taste the tomatoes more. There seems to be some herbs in there too but the garlic is taking over.  . In general this pizza is still pretty good by the standards of this city and I will probably continue to eat a slice here once in a while but overall the pizza is not good enough to justify its own ridiculousness. Pizza is supposed to be easy, convenient and cheap. . . you aren't supposed to have to tilt it to fit it in your front door, somewhere along the way Benny Lemonjello forgot that. This place is a fun gimmick for drunk people who want to marvel over an excessively large slice of pizza. The menu would make it seem they have no interest in selling pizzas to families or businesses, only to drunks. If they would take the same ingredients and offer an 18' pie it would taste much much better than the pie they make now because it would be made better and would cook the whole way. E. Carson Street has seen shops with better pizza than this close (pizza sola for example) so if Benny Piscopo wants to make it in this city he is going to have to step his game up.  . . Overall Rating: 6. 5 out of 10","Went here for the lunch buffet. First bad sign: at 12:30, the place was half full, and yet none of the vacant tables were clean. Yuck. Second bad sign, passing by the salad bar, the lettuce bin was full of huge chunks of brown iceberg lettuce. Gross. Third bad sign, passing by the pasta buffet, the spaghetti was dry and crispy. Eew. The pizzas are plentiful, about six varieties, and frequently refreshed, and, the buffet is cheap. However, the pizza crust is soggy. Sweetie wanted to give a second star because of the frequent pizza refreshing, but it was just too gross for that.","Picked up a pepperoni, sausage &amp; mushroom pizza along with some wings frm Bruno's last nite for the fam. We were blown away by the quality. The meats had exceptional taste and the sauce was out of this world good. If u like chix wings, their's are twice baked and not fried. They were the best!  I plan on duplicating this order time &amp; time again.","Pizza in a mall?!. Hell yes!. This restaurant was surprisingly nice for being inside of a mall. . The staff was attentive and the pizza was delicious. . It was also a very clean restaurant and had a steady stream of patrons during a weekday. . I definitely will return and it's nice to know while I'm shopping, if I get hungry, I won't have to leave the mall.","Basically what you would expect. It's a step above frozen pizza or CiCis. It's \"good enough. \" It's a great place for a young family to take their kids, or for early teenage kids to hang out. Adult taste buds will be less-than-impressed, but I don't think that's their market. Ingredients are fresh, the dough is \"fine, \" and the selection of sauces is interesting enough. . It's good for what it is. Nothing more, nothing less.","This restaurant is absolutely amazing. The staff is very friendly. Their pizza and ravoli is delicious. It's a very nice restaurant for the family and gives very good big portions. I would recommend taking leftovers home.","This is 1 of my favorite to go spots for when I am in town in Vegas. They are a great value and their delivery guys are always fast. Their pizzas are also fantastic and you should definitely give 1 of their cheeseburgers a try. Magura gets an easy 5 stars!","Solid Margherita Pizza, nice, prompt friendly service, right by the fashion show. We didn't make it to the original Grimaldi's Pizza location in NYC and were looking for something in Vegas, so we decided to give this place a go. It turns out it it is owned by the cousins of the original Grimaldi's who split off and opened this one. Our server told up they use the same dough and sauce recipe, but have an expanded menu. They do make their own desserts including cheese cake and have a selection of wine and cocktails, as well as some salads. We enjoyed our simple Marg pizza. There are plenty of topping options (for and additional $2-$5 each) so you could easily build your own $50 pizza! We kept it simple which worked well with the thin NYC style crust. I have a hard time believing that this Grimaldi's equals the NYC location that has lines for days; we enjoyed our pizza but not enough to wait hours for it! Like most other things in Vegas it is an imitation, rarely as good as the original!","Just avoid this place if you don't want to be disappointed. I gave this place 3 chances only because the first time I did like the pizza. Since then they put no sauce on the pizza, nothing like eating dough and toppings. I decided to give it another try and ask for xtra sauce, still dry, I guess they didnt understand what I was saying, or I was thinking they didnt hear me. Well today I gave  it one last try and I asked for xtra sauce and made sure she heard me, took pizza home and disgusting. No sauce very dry. My daughter said little Caesars was better. I don't get it, they are very cheap on sauce, I have never tasted a pizza so dry. I refuse to give them a 4 th chance. They lost my business.","This is as good as it gets when the word pizza is mentioned! Sausage is second to none. . You can tell the owner cares!. This is a must if you like","Update:  Went to SOHO Saturday, 5/6/17 for dinner and the TV volume was so extremely high we couldn't\u200b talk and 2 in our party got headaches so bad they couldn't eat their meals. Major change from our visit a couple years ago!   . Previous Review :  Stopped over before calling it a night after a Friday night Bucco game plus a few stops. We were very pleased with the relaxing atmosphere. Music was playing but not nearly loud enough to drown out our conversation. Took a pizza with us back to the room. It was good. Nice stop when on the North Shore!","I hate to have to decrease my review, but both the quality and the customer service have decreased. Almost every time I get a pizza now, I have to reheat it in the oven because it's not cooked well enough and more often than not, when I call to place an order, the person on the other end sounds very rushed and irritated, as if if I'm bothering them by giving them business. I don't know what happened, but I'm hoping they can get it resolved, because they have great pizza and I would hate to have to stop coming!","Love this place. Great pizza, massive salads, amazing pasta, French bread is so so good and you just simply can't go wrong with the Huge Guacatoni it simply delicious. I would say the only issue with this place is trying to get in here on the weekends or evenings. The wait is usually crazy. Maybe a second location would be good. But usually with long lines comes good food and that's the case here for sure. Staff is always on lint and the joint is clean. The vibe inside with the old 50, 60's style decor is a nice touch. Very comfy. I've tried so many things from here and I have really enjoyed it all. Give this place a try!","Ordered a xlarge (pepperoni &amp; green pepper) pizza for the first time off of the grub hub app and was really impressed! Crispy crust and  fresh peppers! Only lacking more sauce &amp; cheese.  $16 for a 18 inch with the 25% can't be beat. Must try!","A good choice for lunch or dinner in the casino area of the Aria - the $18 prix fixe lunch is, for casino dining, a good deal, with a choice of soup or salad and an individual pie, and it's plenty of food for one person. The pizza is not quite New York style - it's a little thicker, but it's got the right char and bubbles. The puffy, chewy garlic knots are a good starter, too. Service was very good as well. If you're looking for real New York pizza and cheap slices, take the walk to Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan, but Five50 is a good choice if you want a little more than just pizza.","So fresh and good! I loved the pizza and Italian Ice, absolutely delicious! So glad to have this in the neighborhood!","came here with a friend! environment is very nice and clean, as it is brand new! our waitress was very kind and personable and fun! i got the margherita pizza and it was okay, but was expecting a little more neapolitan style touch in the crust and sauce and prefer buffalo cheese. it still hit the spot and i enjoyed the nutella donuts too! i live really close so will probably come back again for late night pizza cravings!","Bought a meatlovers pizza and trying brunos for the first time. The gentleman (possibly the owner) was kind enough to let me know he mistakenly left out an important ingredient, but all was forgiven as soon as I had my first slice and taste! Savory juicy and basically one of the best tasting pizza ive had in a while. My wife is a hard woman to please when it comes to food, but just goes to show how good brunos pizza is that she actually liked something i brought home for her! Haha kidding aside, brunos, you get my 5 star rating and i honestly dont remember the last time i even bothered to write up a review on yelp or let alone rate anyone, making this my first review ever. Kudos and more power and success for you!","We ordered take out from here. Pretty good pizza! I was disappointed with the grilled chicken Caesar salad. It wasn't fresh chicken or grilled. The pizza was good though. I will probably order pizza from here again.","One of my favorite spots of all time. Arizona outdoor eating does not get any better. Great place for a quiet breakfast, great spot for families with kids or dogs, great place to meet people. . Joe's Farm Grill violates some of my food rules; 1) NEVER order a burger made of anything but cow. Joe's Ahi tuna burger is amazing (I AM NOT KIDDING).   2) ONLY order pizza at a restaurant that specializes in pizza. At Joe's they grill the crust and then cover with BBQ sauce, chicken and bacon. Delicious. . Also must try: fried shrimp dinner, apple fritters (breakfast), cream puff with chocolate sauce for desert.","I love this place. I would say this is my pizza joint - everyone's gotta find their pizza joint, you know? Now if I can just get them to say \"the usual?\" when I visit. . . haha. . The crust is really nice here, crispy and chewy, and the sausage is one of the best. We usually get pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. . It tastes better fresh out of the oven there of course, but takeout is great too. I've had the tiramisu as well (I don't think they make that though) which is tasty too.","Just a short drive from my house I was excited to hear about Cafe Porta Alba Annex West opening!!!  Pizza and salads are fantastic (my pizza was actually slightly better than even the Porta Alba at Hilldale). . . as I was hoping for!  The venue is underwhelming and I'm not the biggest fan of the counter order style (similar to Pizza Brutta), but the food was great. We sat outside at their tables on a nice sunny day, but unfortunately you just overlook the parking lot. Great service and friendly staff for sure. . . we will be going back!","It's not like this place needs another 5 star review, but. . . they deserve it. I've been going here for almost a year now. This place has the best pizza. As a point of reference, I've sampled lots of pizza in Italy, I've tried the award winning pizza at Pizzeria Bianco (winner of James Beard award), and I am no stranger to excellent Italian food. So believe me when I say, their pizza is the best! The owners are very hands on and are the type of people who make an extra effort to say hello to everyone. They take pride in their restaurant. Service is usually slow; but the food is always excellent. As an added bonus, their deserts are all handmade. The thing I love the most. . . this is a family owned restaurant and they bust their tail trying to keep up with the demand. I love when I can support local merchants and sample things not available from chain restaurants. I highly recommend this place. In fact, it's Saturday night and I'm in the mood for a great pizza.","Best pizza in Concord hands down. Great atmosphere and a great area downtown Concord. Always busy for a reason!!!!!","Pizzas in this place are good. But for the price on the menu you can go to better places. The device is not good. Paper rolls to ideas napkins??? When I go out and I pay that price for pizza I expect something better. Will not go back.","We have been to this location before and the pizza was great! This time it was 9pm on a Saturday night, we walked in to find 6 ppl sitting at the bar and  one  bartender working. All the tables were empty so we chose one that was  clearly visible from the bar. We aren't  gamblers and were only there for the pizza. We waited a couple minutes, the bartender never acknowledged us. I then decided to keep my eye on him to see if he looked up or made any move to help us. At one point he came out from the bar, I thought maybe to find a server or help us, no he went to the kitchen to retrieve food for someone at the bar. No eye contact was ever made with us. When another guy came in, clearly a regular, he was greeted with \"hi buddy\" immediately. We waited a total of 10-12 minutes and no effort or eye contact was ever made to get us to move to the bar or order. I asked my husband \"Move to the bar, or leave?\"  We left.  . It's a shame that this place that has excellent pizza probably won't make it because of no customer service. Good luck!","Been here twice in the last month, first time with out an appointment, second time with an appointment scheduled before hand. Both experiences were great. Employees are upfront and clear about everything, you know exactly what your options are, no \"maybe\" or \"should be\" like when you go to your cellular carrier. With apple you get what you pay for so the service is worth the wait! Go get some pizza at Sbarro &amp; watch a movie at AMC :)","While everyone goes here for the dogs, the pizza is not be ignored. Hand tossed crusts with a nice selection of specialty pizzas. . Appetizers are good as well. Hummus is a solid choice. Not a fan of their wings. . Beer selection is on point and if you can't find what you want on tap, head into the beer cave. I like that you can find a crazy variety and try new beers. Always busy, so be prepared to wait.","Had a great time at riddleroom a few nights ago celebrating my cousins birthday. We had a large group about 12 people and they were able to accommodate us easily. We ordered snacks for everyone to share. The Japanese popcorn is addictive. The cookies are soooo good. I ordered a pizza panini for myself and it was so delicious. It was loaded with pizza filing and the spicy mayo that came along with it for dipping was great. To drink I had a Nutella latte. I wish this drink could have came in a mug size because it was so good. The barista really nailed this drink down. For dinner we went to a near by bar and we actually came back to riddleroom after for escape rooms and video games. Half of my group had an amazing time doing the escaperoom \"static\" and the rest played smash brothers on the WiiU. It was the perfect celebration for my cousin. I am looking forward to coming back again with my other friends.","The Duck Poutine pizza was difficult to approach, but well worth the mess that I made.","Excellent pizza, with fast and friendly service. What's not to love? Oh, and the bowl of bread they bring to the table. . . stupid good. Do yourself a favor and eat here.","Just AMAZING!!! Great Italian restaurant. The pizza is outstanding. The best in the city!!!i this is the first place I walked in when I came in Toronto on 2009 I am still their client since that time . . . Well done","So staying at a Casino hotel and these guys slip their ad under our door. I call and order and they tell me it will take an hr. Ok whatever it's a hotel but they were over 1hr &amp; 40 mins late and had me waiting for the pizza in the lobby. I had to cancel and they didn't get a crap. Beware and just go somewhere else.","This place cool for kids so I gave it a three. Their pizza is just whatever, and their booths are made for 12 years and younger. My American self could barely squeeze in. They do have tables that pull out to whatever size you need. But when the boss lady wants a booth, you get a booth. And I am not talking about my wife, I am referring to the spoiled brats of the millennial parents, my daughter. Anyways, food is just ok, entertainment for kids is $$ and you only get a . 10 cent Chinese toy that you could get a bag full at the dollar store, but you went to PPP and paid $20 for tokens so your kid could enjoy that cheap cappy toy. And then later you will enjoy heartburn and some toilet time for the honors. Yeah!! Sign me up to double tokens!","Great eggplant parmesan pasta &amp; veggie pizza. I will definitely look them up when I am in the Charlotte area again.","I'm a health freak and my husband knows that. So naturally I was surprised when he suggested we go to a pizza place. He said, \"Trust me, it's different. \" seeing as how I trust him enough to let him go to strip clubs whenever he has to go to bachelor party, I thought I might as well trust him on this one. . We entered the well lit, clean, welcoming place. We were greeted by a bubbly gal named Andrea. Since I'd never been there, she pointed me over to her colleague Stephen who would take care of us. Boy, did Stephen er Steven know his stuff! He explained to us that we get to custom build our own pizza and patiently answered all our questions on toppings. I ended up getting honey wheat crust with half plain marinara and half spicy red sauce (they explained to me they could do that after letting me try the hot sauce and it was too hot). I added mozzarella, artichokes, red onions, green onions, spinach, and cilantro. . We sat down and waited only like 10 minutes for a freshly made pizza. It was sooo tasty! And our service was incredible. If you're the manager of this place, and you're reading this, you need to recognize these two! I though Steven had to be the manager!. Overall great experience, well worth the price, and I can't think of anything I would change.","Tanja rocks the place. Great food and greater service. Newer tvs and pool table. Juke box and Keno. The flat bread pizzas are a perfect choice for something delicious and not heavy. The Lobster Bisque is one of the best around when it's available.","Ridiculous,  should be no stars as no food was prepared when I ordered for pick up. Placed order online for 4 pizzas and several orders of wings. Received confirmation email and pick up time and NO notification that that we were \"supposed\"to call and confirm. . . . Showed up at our designated time to pick up the order for our staff with of course nothing even started and was informed we were supposed to call and confirm by the older gentleman working there. . Horrible customer service and respect for time. Would hate to see you call to make an appointment at ouroffice and then we cancel it because you didn't call us again to confirm that you really did want your appointment you already scheduled. . Little Caesars here we come. . Juan","Breakfast at Hob Nobs was amazing!   We had the breakfast pizza which was foreign to us so we were genuinely surprised. It was awesome!  Crispy crust with great flavors. Wonderful cozy atmosphere. Fun, kind employees. If we lived here our daily stop would be Hob Nobs. They serve lunch n dinner also.","3 stars for chicken and JoJo's. The pizza isn't awful but it wasn't super hot when I picked it up. I gave a 30 min window so that stuff should have been screaming hot. Young kids working there so I am not holding that against them. Chicken not bad. I compare everything to Uncle Nick's in Warren so those are big shoes to fill.","Nice to see this old place up and running again. Nostalgia aside, the rotating draft list has a few nice micro brews, and the pizza prices are all very fair, and quite tasty too!","I've been to Flour &amp; Barley since it opened up at the LINQ a few years ago. They have a large selection of a different variety of pizzas, all prepared very well. They range from traditional toppings to more gourmet items. . The beer menu is great! They always try to have one cask ale available. Only negative is that the cask ales are expensive for the serving size. . Pizza by the slice costs $5 for a pepperoni, $4 for cheese, and $5. 75 for veggie. Not bad prices at all!","Breh best pizza in Toronto. I also love talking to Kim, the girl who works the front whenever I grab a slice. SO good!","If you love thin crust Italian pizza, go here! Very small and always packed, though. Can't say too much. I had a nice meal but have never had the craving to go back so I guess it just didn't make much of an impression on me?","How very trendy this place is. So basically you walk in and they give you a card to just scan at any station you're ordering from and then you get a pager and wait to be buzzed whenever it's ready. It's a neat if confusing concept. . The problem I have with this place is that it's almost impossible to get the attention of one of the cooks making whatever you want to order. Really my friends and I were the only ones in line standing around for a good 3-4 minutes waiting to order a pizza. Which brings me to another point, the pizza here is nothing special to write home about. I jazzed it up with some of the herbs in the pots which I thought was a great idea(that's what they're there for right?), and a healthy dose of olive oil to liven it up. If I was paying regular prices for the pizza I would have said no sir, especially since you are pretty much doing everything but the cooking yourself! But seeing as they have a $5 special on pizza almost every day, I think it's just fine to pop in for a carb loaded snack before you set off to do something else in uptown. . Cheap, quick, not easy to get rung up. Will come again for cheap pizza to pig out on.","Pizza was okay, but really greasy! Not the timeliest either. Wings sauce was decent but it was clearly cooked in pizza oven.","Heard about this place on HappyCow and decided to head to downtown and check it out. This place is awesome. Your typical pizza place with some normal options with a cool vegan cheese option. Not thrown in your face but something nice as an alternative. Oh, did I forget to mention they have soft serve as well?! So good! Definitely a place to check out along your downtown Fremont street adventures.","Awesome beer selection, draft and bottles. You can get beer to go. . Hot dogs and more bar food type stuff. The fries are double-fried (Belgian style) and plentiful. High points of the sandwich menu: The giant fish, the Big Ben cheesesteak (toppings include fries &amp; coleslaw), and the half-pound keilbasa with horseradish, brown mustard, and sauerkraut. . Good pizzas too. The Swissvale Shroom is awesome mushroomy goodness, and I love the Popeye's on a whole wheat crust. . One big warning: Service is wonky, especially if you order both pizza and sandwiches. The pizza kitchen is on a different schedule from the sandwich/dogs kitchen, and they make _no_ attempt to coordinate. Pizzas take 30 minutes and dogs take 10-15, so if you order a sandwich and your buddy orders a pizza, you'll be finished eating before his food gets there. . Down sides: . - The burgers are not very good. They come out large and dry. . - Service is quirky (as mentioned above). . - Gets crowded, especially on weekends. They frequently have a seating list in the dining room side, but I think the bar side is still \"grab a table\" - that's confusing. . Beer only, though they've opened the \"loft\" upstairs that seems to have a full bar - I haven't been there.","Really nice place near the Old Port area in Montreal. This place ended up being off the main street where it was a nice big area for walking and outdoor cafes. Only about a block away, though. It itself had a nice outdoor seating area, but with seven people, they had difficulty accommodating us without a really long wait. . Everything else was fine. Good pizzas we had and others enjoyed the pastas they had.","The five star is for their tasty food. I have always gotten food delivered so never been to their restaurant. . . . Yet. . I am super bummed out that they took off the combo pie(a pizza with any 4 toppings of your choice). That was my go to all the time. . . . This might decrease the frequency I order from then now. :(","Love this place! ! It's our go to pizza party spot!! The colossal pizza is not only impressive it's really good too!! One pizza fed our sons entire birthday party it's great!!! The crust is melt in your mouth buttery with a hint of garlic amazing! ! The staff is super friendly and the service is incredibly fast.","Go to pizza place for Sheridan College students since it's right across from the building. Cost $5. 50 for a medium 1 topping pizza or $6. 25 with tax. They also have poutine and wings too. . Pizza is ok, just to fulfill any cravings and if you want to split it between friends. . . it's not too pricy. . Service is fast and staff are flexible. Ie. I didn't want to carry a pizza box on bus with me so they put it in those take away bags.","Most underrated BBQ in Cleveland. This place doesn't seem like a BBQ joint but don't let them fool you they make some of the best beef brisket you can find in the area. Great bar with a big beer selection and their pizza is good for a slice.","I think therefore I am. . . a pizza fan. I just made a rhyme, wish I could do that every time. See what I did there?. Michael's the quintessential neighborhood restaurant. It is large enough to accommodate a crowd without losing it's intimacy. We went on Friday (3/2/12) and there were two delightful people working and we were always well-attended. And then there's the pizza. . . . My friend and I split a buffalo chicken pizza. I commiserate with you if you've never tried such a pizza and feel you should rectify the situation; Michael's is a fantastic place to do so. The crust was perfect--slightly doughy on the inside with just enough crustiness on the outside. The cheese was solid enough so it stayed on the pizza yet was compliant enough to get those beloved strings when pulling your bite from the remaining slice. The top surface was blanketed with perfectly cooked chicken. Finally, the buffalo (in lieu of marinara) sauce had a great flavor, enough heat to keep you on your toes but not so much to kill your taste buds and preventing your pizza bliss. Describing the ingredients doesn't quite do the pie justice--there is definitely pizza synergy going on here. . Alas, I do have to knock one start from the rating because this is a BAR and restaurant. In my opinion, bars have evolved into carrying a large selection of beer and typically have more than a few taps. Although I didn't do a thorough search, it seemed as though Michael's only carried the typical domestics that I have grown to disdain. Pretentious? Perhaps, but it's what I like. In saying that, Michael's appears to keep it's corner bar image with a close, local clientele who may prefer domestic beer. If so, Michael's caters to their customers' tastes and I commend them. . Try this place for your next pizza craving.","Top notch pizza!! Need good pizza and beer, stop here. Stopped by on a recommendation of a friend, on national pizza day. Surprise got seated right away. Atmosphere is kinda barish but not overly. I like they have several craft local beers!! Had Italian bread as an appetizer came with an olive oil dip, very good. Went with a thin skinny, which is loaded with meat and strips server recommend extra crispy for doneness and he made the perfect call!. Will be a good go to for here on. You need this pizza in your life!!","OMG. Love Nello's. I have not been there in YEARS so went a few weeks ago and WOW. I like lots of cheese and you get it at Nello's. The sausage pizza was great and I hear they make it themselves. Cheap wine and beer as well. The place was crazy crowded. . . and we still got a seat right away. Great waiter and very friendly. Great local place and no wonder they have been open for so many years! :)","Love MOD pizza - and all pizza to be fair and honest. This location is a part of the Tempe Marketplace so if you are out doing some shopping and get hungry or have a group of people who need a few options, this place is good to go. . Inside we were created by friendly staff members who were ready to help and explain how it worked. We chose to build our own pizza - does it get any better!?. Pretty much you load that crust up with everything you ever dreamed of on a pizza. It's pretty much a fat kids dream pizza for a decent price. Our group definitely took advantage of the variety of toppings and loaded them on. . Check out these pizzas!!!!!!","Zero Stars if I could!  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, someone open another kind of pizza place and not Domino's either!  I will say, that when they DO get the pizza right, it's pretty good but I have had soooo many problems with this place. So far they have credited me with so much since they have messed up so often. I really do not want the credits, I WANT THE PIZZA RIGHT!  One time I ordered online for a later delivery because we were not home yet they showed up 30 minutes before we were home and then tried to come back and deliver the same pizza. Another time they got our order wrong and it took 90 minutes to get it right. One time the delivery guy dropped my personal pan pizza on the ground while taking it out of the hot box and promised to get a new one out right away, it took over an hour (I live about a mile from the store). Sometimes they forget the receipt, which really freaks me out because I have no proof of purchase with all of their mistakes. For the most part the toppings are skimpy and I've actually taken pictures of the pizzas because I could not believe they would deliver a pizza like that and then I ordered a pizza and used a coupon code that was sent TO ME and it said it wasn't valid at this Pizza Hut. Why the heck are they sending me coupons that DON'T work at the Pizza Hut I order from?. I'm to the point of opening my own pizza place that delivers because this is just crazy!  The only reason I continue ordering is that when the pizza IS FINALLY right, my kids like it but trust me, they would like it better if the pizza was right every time as I think they are tired of hearing of me complain about Pizza Hut!!!!","Their pizza is really delicious made with the freshest of ingredients. It's the closest thing to New York style pizza I've tasted beside actually going to New York. The employees at Rustic pizza are very friendly and the environment is nice and open. The owners are Italian so you know they're the real deal. I would definitely recommend you try at least each pizza once. They allow you to purchase the pizza by the slice of a whole pizza is to big for you. Also if you into spicy stuff with you pizza they have wings and a spicy chipotle sauce you'll have to try.","This place has been getting a bad rap which I do not understand. Having been a chef for 10 years I understand the need for a very clean kitchen but some of the best food I have ever eaten has come out of the dirtiest places. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying this is some of the best food I have ever eaten! But really as long as the cooks hands are clean I am willing to over look a dirty floor if my food comes out tasty. . So this place is not a true CDDP I guess, which does not matter to me at all! What does matter to me is that it is 2 blocks from my house and has a pick up special of a 14 inch pizza for only $6. 99! At that price I would expect some pretty bad pizza but low and behold each time I ordered it I am finishing the whole thing in a hurry. Only draw back of this place is they sometimes do not have certain toppings so when you call be ready to switch your order. . Lastly the two guys that work there, and possibly own the place are super friendly and always excited to see you, customer service one does not expect from a pick up pizza place late at night. . Oh, and putting crushed chilies on top when you get home is a sure fire way to enjoy the whole pie without realizing!","I love the linq and look forward to eating at flour and barley every time. Amazing service, they are really friendly and great attention to detail. Drinks are amazing and the food. . oh the food! Calabrese pizza: awesome one of my go tos, 4 cheese w pepper: crazy good almost like a creamy garlic gread. . Their meatballs are phenomenal. Chicken wings are delicuous and so was the cheesy bread. Go see Ivan. Hes the man!!!! Enjoy folks","Great pizza joint! I'm from the States and try to always stick to local, non-chain eateries wherever I travel. (Thanks, Yelp!). Love At First Bite isn't overly warm and friendly if you're not a regular -- but hey, that's true \"New York\" style. You can't beat a made-to-order personal pie and beer for just 10 bucks. Plentiful, greasy cheese and all the fixings (Parmesan, red pepper, garlic, etc. ) to shake on top of it. Fast, no frills, no negatives!","I am originally from NJ so I am quite demanding when it comes to pizza. I ordered the chicken parm sandwich since i had a bit of a crave for that.  . As I waited (about 15 minutes), i saw the guys making, slicing and sending out the pizza. I then was wishing I had ordered the pizza to check it out. . The chicken parm? It was good. A decent size sandwich for the money. Was still hot when I got to my friend's place 7 min away. I left wanting the pizza though since it looked and smelled quite good. Next time for sure. . .","First of all, I know nothing about Italian food. My opinion on the taste of Carpaccio was just okay. . . maybe its because I was not familiar with Italian spices. I thought it may taste like Japanese beef tataki but i was wrong. . . . . Our pizza canadeses was spicy + all three side toppings were even more spicy. . . I didn't expect that. . . . Finally I tried this panna cotta for the dessert that I've never heard of and i really loved it. . As for the price, I think it's a tinny bit over priced. . . I was expecting a little more topping on their pizzas. . I had no complains about the service, although she didn't say goodbye to us when we left, she patiently explained the menu and offered her recommendations.","What can I say?! I am seeing more and more restaurants pop up in Downtown Phoenix and I am loving it! When I heard about Nook I of course was excited since I just went and visited the other location. . We arrived about 830 on a Saturday night. Tons of traffic due to who knows what! Valet was full no problem so I parked around the block. Walking in the decor and ambience makes you feel comfortable. The colors vibrant and subtle. I fell in love with the chair at our table,  I felt like a queen! . The menu has all the same plus some new additions as well. I already knew to order a pizza from a previous visit in Arcadia. My boyfriend decided on the Diavolo. A red sauce pizza with basil and a somewhat spicy meat. Amazing! . I ordered the Short Rib. The picture I have will show just how wonderful it was. The entree came with leek mashed potatoes and baby green beans. We shared the food and loved every bite! Compliments to the chef. We were checked on a few times and made sure we had everything we needed. . We normally do not get dessert as we do not have room in our tummies, but a lovely old friend of my boyfriends came by and recommended the oooy gooey butter cake! Oh yeah! We made room for that for sure. All I can say is we are craving to go back very soon! . Go by and support this place! It is connected to the new Hilton Garden on a Monroe. Check out the lovely patio or dine inside and enjoy a wonderful meal!","Haven't eaten here in a while. Tonight, ordered like 4 pizzas and bread sticks for take out. . . Terrible!   Undercooked. Greasy. . I'll never order from this location again. . Entire slices had grease dripping from underneath. . Breadsticks still had garlic dripping.","I was bored one weekend and had their little flier so I bought a large for 5. 99.  . I like their pizza compared to other chains such as Pizza hut and Little Caesars. I like their sauce and they seem to be nice people. Give them a try, it's cheap enough!","I was skeptical when my friend suggested this new pizza place on Monkland for lunch. . . . there's sooooo many new pizza places opening and most are like all the other old pizza places (not that great). No 900 is different, it's one of the best pizzas I've ever had! It's minimal ingredients for maximum flavor, not easy to do. The pizza dough is almost a cross between traditional pizza and Indian Nan bread and the result is delicious. Service was outstanding, very attentive friendly staff. It has an almost old world charm to it, like having freshly made pizza in Tuscany (ok, I've never had pizza in Tuscany so I really have no basis for that statement). Definitely give No 900 a try if you live in the Monkland Village or are in the neighborhood, you'll be very happy you did. . P. S. - Take the ends of the crust and dip in the chili oil, mmmmmmmm","This place is a specialized branch of the local Al-Taib Pizza / Lebanese food chain. And I do mean \"local\" - there are two other locations within two blocks!. The strange thing about this one is that it's not what sign claims it to be. No kebab, no wraps - just Pizza and a salad bar. The 24 hour sign must be for the chain as a whole because this place is definitely closed mornings and some afternoons. There isn't really a lot of variety compared to Double Pizza, either. . But all of that seems pretty moot, because the pizza is both consistently good and consistently cheap. Can't argue with that!","The pizza is among the best in Pittsburgh but it is very inconsistent. If one of the owners is working the pizza is amazing and is easily a 5 but if they are not the quality drops significantly. It makes me want to call and ask who is working before placing an order because the experience can drastically differ. I can't give less then a 4 because I have walked out with amazing pizza but unfortunately it doesn't happen every time.","Tonight was my first time dining here. The new owners were working and were very helpful. My wife and daughter have food allergies, and they were very accommodating recommending menu items that they could eat. My daughter had a personal pizza with sauce and mushrooms and no cheese. She also got the wedge fries. She is a very picky eater, and she ate half the pizza and all the fries. My wife and I had the Manhattan Man pizza and a side of wings. The pizza is a thin crust, but is not dry like most thin crust. We did not get extra cheese, and the cheese to topping ratio was perfect. We didn't get to eat the wings as we couldn't stop eating the pizza. They will have to wait for tomorrow. I did see that they do delivery, so this is our new pizza place from now on.","Fabulous! Fabulous! The bruschetta is the best I've ever had. The garlic knots are delicious and the margarita pizza is yummy! Excellent service! I'm Italian and very picky about Italian food and it's great here!","This is absolutely the best pizza in DeForest. Everyone there is always super friendly too!","I had the best experience here. The room, pool, and casino were great. The pizza place in the casino was amazing. The staff was a little rude, but I'm from the south am maybe I'm used to a bit more hospitality. Overall it was a great experience and we had a great deal.","In Vegas from out of town and wanted some great pizza, therefor I found Verona Pizza on Yelp! &amp; I do not regret it ! Ordered a 18 slice Supreme Pizza &amp; Mild wings, flavor was on point for both items. The employees / owner are beyond great. They made sure food was right or if we needed anything &amp; very attentive. I'm most definitely coming back in my next trip to Las Vegas. Not to mention its conveniently not too far from the strip :-) thank you Verona Pizza","We booked a package to see the Grand Canyon South Rim. The price offered a 15 hour narrated tour with lunch. . Here are the package details: . -Includes complimentary wake-up service &amp; pick from most major hotels on the strip and downtown area!     Enjoy Danish, Juice, Coffee &amp; Tea. - Depart from our tour center after check-in located just minutes off the Las Vegas Strip    . - Professional driver / guides will narrate throughout the tour. - Photo stop of the Hoover Dam taken from the amazing O'Callaghan-Tillman Bridge. . -  See the extinct volcano \"Fortification Hill\". - Exclusive stop at National Geographic Visitors center with optional Imax Grand Canyon Discovery &amp; Adventure movie. - Visit the widest and deepest point at Grand Canyon's South rim (over 8400 ft deep and 21 miles across). - Includes meal voucher for the Grand Canyon National Geographic Visitors Center. - Ride aboard a luxury double decker motor coach equipped with video monitors, restrooms &amp; air conditioning. - Free Show Tickets With All Tours!. Sounds good, right? . We are picked up at the hotel around 6am and shuttled to another building about 10 minutes away. The driver locks the passengers into the bus and proceeds to stand in the inside of the building, drinking coffee. Some of the passengers need to use the restroom and become claustrophobic after seeing about 5 or 6 other buses emptied before our bus. After 30 minutes and one passenger making 2 phonecalls to their customer service office, we are finally let off that transport bus. . Next we are herded into a large hallway and split into South and West Rim tour packages. The customer service representative for the tour company apologizes for the lack of information given to us about the tour procedures. He explains that it is their busiest time of the year and we should bare with them. He also has to apologize for the heating vents set at about 80 degrees and the broken tvs which are supposed to explain the tour to us. We quickly find out that the IMAX is not free, but we are welcome to purchase it when we pay a one time fee at the next desk. . At that desk we are given stickers to wear on our chest. Our bus driver insists we cannot get on the bus unless we first put the sticker on our chest and let him draw on them with a pen. I asked if he could just sign it in my hand and then I'd put it on in front of him, but he refused. I wonder if this way every passenger or just the women?. The buses left about an hour after schedule. Because of this, the driver informed us we were supposed to visit the hoover dam but would be skipping it to save time for the grand canyon. . The narration turned out to be the driver periodically pointing out 2 or 3 places he felt were interesting. For the rest of the 5 hour drive each way we were forced to watch a 30 minute movie about the canyon, and a box office failure, Zookeeper, and Some Las Vegas ventriloquist. So much for an informed narration?. The lunch turned out to be a voucher for pizza hut at the national geographic center. If you purchased the IMAX you would have an hour to eat and watch it, otherwise you ate and waited for the movie to finish. We also spent 1 hour on each drive at Mcdonalds so the bus driver could get Lunch and dinner. . Once we finally got to the Canyon we only had an hour at two viewing points. It was not enough time to get the full experience. We felt rushed to get back to the bus on time. We even missed the visitor center at our first of two viewing points. A group from our tour bus couldnt get back in time and we left without them. Luckily they found their way to the bus for the 5 hour drive back. . At about 9 oclock during the drive back, the bus driver decided we had enough time for the Hoover Dam. Unfortunately my camera doesnt deal with pitch black night scenes. We were given 5 minutes to look at it from the bridge above. . Overall I was quite disappointed with this trip. If anyone asked me, I'd say pay extra and go for the helicopter tour. 3 hours out of your day and a lot less hassle.","We were wandering around little italy for the first time today . . and wandered into vivoli by accident. Food? B+ Price? B+ Ambiance? it was around 2:45PM so it was nearly empty . . . Service? D. It was actually the cook/chef who seated us . . . the waitress was dicking around and didn't show up until we were ready to order. The cook was super nice, but the waitress definitely needs an attitude adjustment. She was strutting around with her cans hanging out, which is totally fine, but please just don't have such an attitude! I skimmed over the previous reviews . . . which seem to have comments about the poor, poor service and i can't say that i disagree!. She didn't come to take our order until maybe, 20 minutes later? During this time, she was serving other patrons who came in AFTER us . . . which is also fine since they might've been regulars/friends. but then, her friends also showed up . . . and her boyfriend too and then she sits there and just socializes . . . . Service was curt and rude. Let the beer sit on the bar for 10 minutes before bringing it to us. Brought the bread over way after we ordered . . . at the same time with the main course actually. . I had the baked manacotti . . . . very yummy. Super hot when it came out. Delicious! The pizza was ok . . . it was thin crust like how i like it. Also loved the bread in the beginning too!. Lunch orders are 25% off . . . in which she did not give us. The owner (??) noticed us looking over the bill and was perceptive enough to do something (thank you). . I will also include that I left a 2 dollar tip on a 30-dollar order and that was being SUPER gracious.","Met up with friends here as a last minute alternative since we couldn't get reservations for a saturday evening anywhere in the city. I am so glad my friend suggested this place - we loved it. It wasn't too difficult to get a table and the waitstaff was super attentive. My SO and I split the gnocchi and the fiama pizza. LOVED the pizza and the gnocchi was pretty good too. The dessert we had was dark chocolate mousse that was fantastic, whipped and airy. Great wine list as well - loved the reisling. . Great food - great service. Just wish they had a few more pasta dishes but I am also a firm believer that if you do something well you don't need to do everything. And they do make great pizzas. Will definitely return.","This place is suppose to be a mall, but it more so like 5 stores all selling Steelers gear and a pizza place. The pizza place staff was pleasant, place was clean. I read the review for this place and was not willing to try, we were going to dinner in a hour but I was hungry now. So we decided to grab a slice and split it. It was ok, not the worst ever but surely not the best. Im from jersey/ny so pizza is very different. There was too much sauce and the sauce was not good, taste like from a can. Cheese was weird even though she put it in the oven to heat, the cheese on the pizza was still not melted. So not a fan but meh","Ordered the supreme pizza with a side of wings- both are amazing. Crust is delicious, the ingredients are fresh, and the wings are superb! Highly recommend it!","The pizza here is a must have. I love the meat lovers. Very generous with toppings. Never took opportunity to dine in mostly because of the small dining area. First time offering wings was a disappointment,  but then I found the secret. . . . . . Ask for the wings well done. Phenomenal. Price is a little on the high side but over all I am always pleased.","Loved that it was a BYOB- really makes going out for a date night not as costly. Appetizers were delicious, we go the antipasto with gluten free bread (Delicious GF bread- couldn't tell the difference!), the Caprese salad was delightful because the mozzarella was SO fresh! We also order the gluten free Caprese sandwich and a pizza with sausage and potatoes. Everyone had a great meal. The only disappointment was that there is no gluten free pizza crust. But the sandwich options made up for that!","I'm not sure about the other reviews - but I was there on Thursday and the pizza was TERRIBLE!!  No flavor, and it was expensive!  Including tax and tip it was a $23 pizza (medium, 10\") and I only ate 2 slices.  . The wings were good. We had Honey Garlic, Dill Pickle, Suicide and Thai Peanut. Don't order the thai peanut - they weren't good, but the rest were fine. . I would go back for the wings only and not the pizza. Tuesday and Thursday is Wing Night.  10 Wings for $2. 50.  we sat in the lounge. The service was pretty quick.","Not to be a snob or anything but, what the hell is this place doing in Cleveland?. I was in town for a week, and managed to eat here three times. . A+ for the mmmmushroom burger, sweet potato/peanut butter soup, soba salad, hot artichoke dip, and mediterranean pizza - which has a base of the artichoke dip, and I'm pretty sure that the base (\"flatbread\") is a chapati. MMM.  Note that you can also get gluten-free buns for the burgers. . I'm so irritated that I crave something in Cleveland. I hope there are enough vegans around to keep them open - but non-vegans, you will enjoy this too. I was the only vegan at the table for all 3 visits.","Rocco's is our go to place for NY-style pizza and for good reason. Not only is it super close to home, but more importantly, they use some terrific toppings. Their sausage, in particular, is the bomb. The sauce is excellent and exhibits a winning blend of acidity, herbs, and spices. The crust, while very good, is not the best that we've had and does tend to get soggy after awhile from all the delicious toppings. . We usually get a large (18 inch) \"Everything\" pizza to go, but their sausage and peppers sub is mighty tasty as well. The price ($18) is on the higher side, but we don't mind shelling out a little extra for this kind of quality. Call ahead and your pie will be ready for pickup in about 15-20 minutes.","I don't know why you would spend 14$ on a pizza from this place when you can go to Albertson's, which is right across the street, and get a DiGiorno pizza for 4$ that tastes the exact same. Plenty of better pizza places nearby, I suggest skipping this particular one.","I tried Mamajouns based on all the great Yelp reviews and wasn't disappointed. Fresh ingredients, clean and tidy seating area and friendly service. I had a joun which was delicious. I'll definitely be back to try the pizzas!","Such a nice idea to make your own pizza with the fresh ingredients which you like or inspire you the most. Any pizza topic of your wish, found on your plate. And fast service as well for a quick lunch. Before running back to work.","Been there quite a few times in the past few years and I have to say that I have enjoyed the experience. The customer service is great and the beer of cause is always good! They have an eclectic menu and seem to have a great variety of interesting choices. I tasted the Butter Chicken pizza during my last visit and I was absolutely impressed. Keep it up!","Happy hour at the Vig is. . . a m a z i n g. The portions and prices on all the appetizers are incredible and the simple beer list is still full of tasty, hoppy goodness. You can't pass up the Hot Vings, the Trifecta sliders or the Tandoori Chicken flatbread pizza. . . they're cheap, they taste great, and they're hearty portions (for appetizers). . In fact. . . all this talk about delicious food. . . I'm going back right now!","3. 3/5. I was quite excited when I heard about this place. Its a really cute Italian cafe &amp; restaurant on Spadina where you can get your coffee from extremely fancy espresso machine. They got some nice comfort Italian food but I been better places with similar price so I was bit disappointed. . If you are looking for a nice cup of coffee or cute place to hang out with friends, this isn't a bad place to check out but for food, I will just go to King street and will get a better pizza.","A great place to enjoy an Italian style thin crust pizza! My experience here was great and better than Terroni's. The servers here were friendly, attentive and quick! After 5 minutes from ordering, we immediately received our appetizers! The Bruschetta Rustica was very good as they used fresh tomatoes which were very juicy and felt very quenching in my mouth. The Ceasar Salad was not bad but a little on the cheesy side but I think that's an Italian signature! My main dish was the Tre Came and I found it very tasty! The crust was thin but it was still able to maintain it's crunchiness! The pizzas here are about 12 inches which is good to share between 2 people but as the pigs we were, my sisters and I ordered our own dishes and ended up bringing home leftovers but in the end I was able to try two more different pizzas! The Americano was good but a little less on the crunchy side while the Primavera tasted okay but had a very sour topping on it that we ended up removing (still can't figure out what that was) All and all, it was good and I enjoyed it very much!","First time visiting Hungry Howie's and it was a great experience. The customer service here is great. . My family and I came in to order 6 pizzas for a party we were attending. The system at Hungry Howie's seemed to be having some issues and unfortunately the card payment wasn't going through. After a couple attempts the manger assisted and we were able to get it done. He even offered a discount to accommodate us for system processing time. The willingness to accommodate was such a kind gesture and exceeded our expectations. . The pizza was a hit at the party as well. Decent prices. Will be coming back.","Tried this tonight for dinner. We got the caprese (very bland, unripe tomatoes and missing EVOO) for an appetizer. My daughter got the kids spaghetti and meatball (super good), my husband got the Milan Chicken (bland and overcooked chicken) and I got margheritta pizza (not amazing. . . . pretty soggy). My husband said we would come back again and give it another try sometime but we would definitely order different things. We really wanted this place to wow us but that didn't happen tonight.","We've eaten here several times and it's one of our favorite places to have a beer and some great wings. Their pizza is good and baked ziti is wonderful. The prices are reasonable and service has always been a plus.","Grew up in 20 minutes outside of Manhattan in New Jersey so I am a pizza connoisseur this pizza was practically average it had the look the place had the look but didn't have that amazing taste or flavor of a true East Coast Pizza. The mens room was absolutely disgusting The sink had stains in it like they've been there for months along with everything else. . They talk the talk but don't walk the walk.","Value in Vegas? So rare but so refreshing. Found the tickets on Travelzoo for $30. Costumes were great &amp; the performers put their heart into it. Lip synching and dancers were a little off but I lost count with the number of songs. Stage lacked pizzazz but overall my 20 something kids and I were very entertained. If you're burned out on dropping a fortune on a night out but want some fun, this is a good fit. Buckets of beers $16 &amp; speciality drinks were 2/$12 making this a big win.","Delicious pizza. The white pizzas are really good too. Nice cozy atmosphere. The bread they give to start is  tasty, fresh and warm. Good service. I've been wanting to go back asap.","Best pizza in Vegas!! We ordered to our hotel room twice and both times it was fast and delicious. HIGHLY recommended!!","Okay pizza, was convenient for us because we live down the street. However, we will not be going there again because of the \"we support Red for Ed\" sign prominently displayed in their window. We were going to eat there today but barely opened the door and walked out . . . to another restaurant. We are not interested in supporting socialist causes.","My husband is from Chicago and this is his favorite pizza place. We called in advance to order and the pizza was ready to eat when we arrived and the table set up. We loved the pizza and the service, we will be back!","This place is likely one of my favorite places on the strip. It's reasonably priced and has tasty Italian-based meals. . I've been there twice, and bother times were fab. Once I ate at a table and the next time at the bar. . They can make the pasta dishes vegetarian. My favorite is the gnocchi with a vodka sauce. I've also had their pizza, which is part rustic crust and cheesy deliciousness. . Decent wines and of course bubbles.","Lamb meatballs,  garlic rapini and charred cauliflower do not disappoint. My daughter. had the pizza Margeurite and mud pie for dessert, both of which she enjoyed. A friend had a pasta dish which looked lovely. They don't have gluten free pasta or pizza which is disappointing and I have found the red wine a little warm, but this place remains a go to favourite.","Mmmmmm. . . ALERT! ALERT! BEST PRETZELS IN THE WORLD HERE! The pizza pretzel is out of this world amazing!!! The little butter PRETZELS taste delicious as well and the cheese you dip it in is to die for! Eat these! You won't regret it!!!!","I love this place! My boyfriend and I go to ASU and we often go for their \"happy hour\" deal. Their happy hour is if you order a sandwich to eat in you get free chips and a drink! It's a really good deal and it's great food. Recently my boyfriend and I went in and the staff was friendly and there was a guy who I didn't recognize as an employee he was offering us free samples of pizza they made to see if they wanted to put it on the menu, we politely declined and he and my boyfriend talked a little while I ordered. When my boyfriend and I went to pay the cashier told my boyfriend that \"Ike had paid for our meal. He came and told me and I was confused but then I noticed the cartoons of Ike on the walls and it made sense. The employee offering samples was Ike! After we received our food we thanked him for our free food and had a small conversation. I haven't had such great customer service in a long time and it just makes me loves this place even more!","The pizza is good. My son likes their cheeseburgers and their fries are ok. We've had them deliver a few times and haven't had any issues. The most recent delivery they were early so that's a plus. Their food isn't bad and they have a decent menu.","WHEN the pizza is heated properly, it's not too bad. If you're hungry. At least, it's better than Cora Pizza, the next door competitor. . Problem being--they NEVER heat it long enough. Today I ran out of patience with the soggy crust, congealed cheese and lukewarm topping that this underheating produces. (I'm also pregnant, so wanted to make sure the deli meats on the slice were heated through properly. ) So I asked the lady to put it back in the oven for me for a little while. (I was perfectly polite, btw. ). You would have thought I had just asked her if I could take a pee in their sink. . She was SO grudging and rude, shaking her head and mumbling under her breath. Seriously?!? Lady, if you are not prepared to meet a simple, easy request from a customer who doesn't want to get food poisoning from your tepid pizza, you should not be in the business. Go and do something in an industry where you don't ever have to interact with people. . Anyway, once they had put it back in the oven for 2 minutes longer, the pizza was fine. I don't know why they don't just do this in the first place. Is it because they think people are in such a rush they'd rather eat cold, soggy pizza than wait an extra 2 minutes? Or is it because they are trying to sling as many slices in as little time possible? Either way they should have a little more respect for their product, and their customer. I might give it one more try, but if I get the same cold pizza followed by a death stare again, no way Jose. . I think the place has such a high rating bc people are comparing it to Pizza Pizza, which is honest to god the worst, most overpriced pizza in the world. Seriously, saying that this is way better than Pizza Pizza is not saying much at all. If you think Papa Ceo's is the peak of pizza perfection, I feel sorry for you, my friend. It's greasy, cheap pizza--pretty satisfying when it's done right (or you're stoned off your chops), but that's it. . Also taking off a half star because they don't have hot sauce (at least the didn't today). Only thing that makes cold pizza palatable IMO.","Great pizza! We were a little skeptical due to previous reviews. However we decided to give it a shot having gotten tired of getting the same old pizza places around. And we were very happy that we did. Crust was nice a fluffy sauce was season just enough and had the right amount on the pizza and good toppings. What more could u ask for in a great pizza definitely recommend!","So I am writing this review after my 4th visit. . 1st visit: My wife and I had seen the opening soon sign for several months and had been waiting for it to open. We went to sushi nearby and noticed that it was open on the way back from dinner. We were already full from dinner but figured we'd try some beers. We were disappointed that they didn't have their own brews yet, but the beers we did have were delicious. The light colored coffee beer was unique and the 300 foot Steve was one of the better beers I've had on tap. . 2nd visit: We came for lunch this time so we could try some of the food and we noticed a bomb-looking salad on our first visit so we decided to get some salads. I got the peach and prosciutto salad. It was really good and filling enough for lunch. I got the 300 Foot Steve beer Super positive experience overall. . 3rd visit: This is really where I was won over. We came for dinner and invited a friend. Finally a restaurant in Surprise I can invite a friend and feel confident in the food and experience. We started with poutine and it was as horribly-amazing as poutine is supposed to be. My wife and I shared the diavola pizza and our friend ordered the peanut butter and jelly burger (you read that correctly). The pizza was probably in the top 5 pizzas I've had in the last year, but you really need to like spicy food to enjoy. The real star was the PBJ burger. My wife and I both tried a bite, and my god is that thing some unholy pact with the devil. By all rights it shouldn't be good, but it really, really was. . 4th visit: This time was all beer all the time. I tried the freak'n raspberry, 300 ft steve (again bc it's that good), Sun-up Amber, and an IPA I can't remember the name. The raspberry was good, but not as sour as I would have liked for a beer in that category. Sun-up Amber was the weakest of the bunch. IPA was solid. Overall after 4 visits, the service was always prompt and friendly. The food was always excellent and inventive. This is the restaurant that my wife and I have wished was in Surprise since we moved here 7 years ago. We will be returning often and are so happy that it's here. . TL;DR - Go here try awesome food, drink awesome beer, be surprised it's in surprise.","My husband grew up on this pizza and now we order it anytime we are in the area. The whole family loves it. Get the sausage or deluxe.","This is my third time eating at Joe Mommas, so I think I can be truly fair in my review now. . The first time was a few years ago when we first moved to The steele Creek area. The food was great in my opinion. I had a meatball sandwich and my wife at a steak salad that she loved. . The second time was a miss. I went back for the great meatball sub, which was subpar no pun intended. I also had a couple slices of pizza, which were nothing to call him about. And my wife had the same steak salad. but she enjoyed again. . Today I think will be my final trip to Joe Mama's. because the pizza was not good. Maybe worthy of $1 slice special, but not for $2. 50. The meatball sub was just OK. Seems like the quality of the food has just gone downhill since my first visit.","Called the Papajoun its like eating a thin crust pizza with beef with your favourite toppings then flipped into a shawarma-like sandwich. It made for an interesting sandwich for only $4. . This place has some limited seating and is the second Armenian place I have eaten with the first one being on Victoria Park called the Armenian Kitchen. Both are equally located in deserted strip plazas so are a bit hard to find when driving by since you never think there would be anything good in those plazas. . This place is definitely brings a new taste to sandwiches and pitas since I had not eaten anything like I did here although the taste overall was average I am still looking forward to eating out here since its in my old neighbourhood that I frequent a lot.","Maybe I should have read the reviews prior. . . . Told me my pie would be to me within THE hour. . . I clarified within AN hour right? Correct. An hour seems a bit long for a place 2 miles away.  1:15 later, called in and aoh yes, the driver is just leaving now.  nice.  $5 off the next pie ok? NO.  ok $10 off the next. Fine. Arrived 1:38 minutes after ordering. No high hopes here.  . Pizza was luke warm at best. Lovely.  and the wrong type!  We ordered DEEP DISH, got PAN.  Now if you read the menu, which I did, they have deep dish and pan. Now I understand that.  called back and got a manager that tried to explain that deep dish means pan to them on their system!!  R U kidding me???? I am not interested in solving your corporate stupidity, I want the pizza I ordered and I ordered it exactly how it is listed on your site!. Now the only thing that kep them from a 1 star rating is the manager offered to send another pizza for free, which I turned into next time and I did not have the time to wait for another timely delivery. So KUDOS to the manager for doing the right thing, however everything else left a lot to be desired. I know I will go back for 1 more pizza at least. . .","Really enjoyed the food here. I don't remember the exact name but I got the squash ravioli and one of their pizzas to split with a friend. The squash ravioli was amazing. It came with a white sauce which I prefer and was the perfect portion. Their pizza was average, and I'm glad I shared it because it's a bit much for one person. Also had these zucchini frites as an appetizer and I really liked those. I would recommend to try a few things on the menu since they have so many great options and share it so you get the chance to taste a bit of everything. The waiter was very nice and informative, and it wasn't busy at all when I went (around 11:45pm). Would definitely come back!","Pizzuvio serves the kind of pizza that will haunt your dreams after. That chewy, crispy crust. . . I just. . . ugh. It's so hard to find good Neopolitan pizza like this. I didn't intend to eat the entire thing in one sitting, but I did--and I wasn't sick or stuffed or groggy afterwards. I just kept thinking of that pizza for the rest of the day and how I'm looking forward to going back. I also got a few of the appetizers, which were okay. I had suppli in Rome several years ago, and the suppli amatriciana that I got here wasn't quite up to that level.  (Not that it was bad. )  The restaurant itself is pretty cool; it's got a very crisp, clean feel, which is a little incongruous when you think pizza and street food, but it worked. Great downtown addition to the other quick service places that serve customized meals (e. g. V3, Simple Greek, Chipotle, etc. )","The french fries were amazing and the pizza is better than Wolfgang Puck's pizza. . Would definitely come back to this restaurant and try every single pizza on their menu. The restaurant is a little dark. . #DateNight also try the shrimp risotto the portion was very small and I don't think it was worth ordering again. .","An all time favorite of my family and I. And I'm never one for dogs, burgers and pizza, but this one . . . this is the exception. . The Venue: Small, somewhat old place in the same complex as SakeBomber. Plenty of parking. With indoor and outdoor seating. Clean and well maintained. . The Chow: Burgers, hotdogs, Polish, Brats, White Hots. Toppings the usual plus cheese, chili, grilled veg and sauerkraut for an additional fee. Fries and Onion Rings. Old school Milk Shakes. . REVIEW: Love the grilled offerings of Polish and White Hots. So delicious! The onion rings are awesome and the fries good. Heard the burgers are delicious too, bigger and of course cost a bit more than your fast food chain burger. . TIP: If you plan a trip, go early. Lines, no matter what day can get really long. But if you do get there during peak, I can tell you it is worth the wait.","Very good buffalo chicken ceaser salad. First try for this salad, excellent sauce. Buffalo chicken pizza was also very tasty. Zach the server was excellent as well.","Oregano's is a fun local place that I love to take visitors from out of town. The food is delicious and the portion sizes are monstrous. The hang-up is getting into the restaurant. Their policy is that you can't call ahead and they don't take reservations. It's a small restaurant so the wait time to get in during the busy dinner hour on Fri/Sat is usually an hour. They try to help the wait time by bringing around samples of their thin crust pizzas from time to time. The wait time is a big factor of why we don't go there very often . Their portion sizes are huge and easily shareable. You only get an entree with your pizza or salad order with salad or bread \u00e0 la carte. Most of the pasta dishes will include some bread slices. . The decor is fun but the restaurant is small and usually busy so it is typically noisy. Probably not the best atmosphere for a one on-one dinner. . Overall it is a fun place to take a group of people and order a bunch of dishes when you have time for a long dinner. Everything I've had there was excellent! I usually get the Big Rig pasta which has just enough kick for me. We will be back.","Jardin is a nice, casual lux place to enjoy a meal. First off, they got carpet on the bottom of their tables y'all. Apparently that's code for classy. . I recently went for an industry mixer at Jardin where they were serving a prefixe menu and the food was so damn good!!! Just wish I hadn't ate so much before going to XS! . Margherita Pizza- it's no NY pizza but definitely a nice starter . Kale salad-  I could've ate 12 plates of this. Who the heck likes Kale anyway?. Steak kabobs- steak was tender and the veggies were nicely marinated . Penne pasta- my favorite dish of the night. It had corn, eggplant, and it was bomb. This was what slowed me down at the nightclub for sure. . It was nicely paired with their Moscow mule. Odd cause it was served in a glass. . I would love to go back for lunch because the view overlooks the pool and it's so serene and pretty. Can't go wrong at Wynn/encore when dining.","This emporium of pizza deliciousness was a fortuitous find! It has yummy pizza and salads, great baseball- themed decor, friendly staff, and tasty desserts. The pizza is thin crust so it is cooked and served quickly. We had the vegetarian pizza, due to the nice combo of eggplant, zucchini, etc. The four of us shared one pizza, one salad and two desserts, which was perfect. Our arugula salad was excellent. The tiramisu and canolli were really good, couldn't ask for better. I wish there was one of these near my home, I'd be eating there weekly!","We were down in fremont street and wanted a quick slice of pizza, so we walked by this place and  decided to order. . The pizza seems to be pretty much cooked and once you order they pop it back in the oven. . Not my favorite pizza but it wasnt bad. The location inside it pretty cute, they have playing cards, a post card, room key and a chip from each of the casinos hanging on the walls. All the employees were pretty freindly.","Quality pizza with a satisfying crispy crust. . Just walking by the arsenal of pizza on display, I was able to tell that there's quality and care put into their pies. The pizzas looked amazing. Plus, slice prices were very reasonable for what you get (around $3. 50). I had the pleasure of two different slices:. 18b - Traditional cheese pizza infused with herbs. Very tasty, with a great crispy crunch to along with it. . Goodman - There's a lot going on with this pizza. In fact, I thought too much was going on. The flavor combo on this one wasn't the best with the caramelized onions, potato, etc. I preferred the simplicity of the 18b over this. Still, pretty decent. . In terms of pizza, they do come off on the lighter side. They are not overly greasy, leaving me with a notable crispy crust to munch on. If hungry, it might take 2-3 slices to get your fill. . It might be a little disappointing to go out of your way specifically for the pizza, but it's a definite stop if I'm in the area. . Note: Parking at the Plaza is a bit of a pain. Pay $5 to get in, get validation wherever you eat, then run to the cashier cage to get your money back. It's a slight run around, but just make sure you have cash to get in!","I ended up all alone on NYE 2014, and wandered a mile back to my hotel room. It was around 1am and was hungry, so I called the front desk checking on my food options. They transferred me directly to R&amp;B, and ordered a pie for $12. The pizza arrived within 30 minutes, and it was pretty dang good. The delivery guy was friendly as well. Can't beat the convenience and quality, thanks!","My friend invited me here as part of the happening gourmand that's currently under way. . The place in located in old mtl, so I thought to myself is this one of those tourist trap joints? But it turns out it doesn't matter because we ate well and paid less so I'm happy I went. . We all ordered from the happening gourmand menu, which include entr\u00e9e, main and dessert. For entr\u00e9e I had portobello mushroom with asparagus with fontina sauce and fried calamari, then grilled veal and Osso buco  for mains and chocolate praline cake. . The portobello and asparagus were well done, with the sauce blend very well with everything. The fried calamari was also very nice, the meat was tender and the batter was light brittle and soft, it melted nicely as you bit into it. . The Osso buco was the best dish of the night, it was fall off the bone. It was served with a cheese risotto and top with a nice tomato sauce. The portion was huge but I couldn't stop eating it. . The veal was a bit dry and no sauce made it very boring to eat. . . . The chocolate cake was very rich, a bit on the sweet side, but you definitely feel the chocolate. . It was an exceptional menu for the price, 23-33$ depending on what extras you took. The quality of the food surprised it, I would definitely come back even without happening gourmand. They also have a pizza oven so can't wait to try that out.","We like simple dishes especially Pasta. I love the margarita pizza and aglio olio pasta. Service is good and you don't have to wait very long for the food. The cappuccino is expensive and some of the dishes are a little over priced  but this is Vegas.","So I decided to give in and try a fancy schmancy place on the strip over the weekend. Usually I try to avoid restaurants on the Strip because they're overcrowded, overpriced and in general the wait is to long. Luckily I had to join my friend as she was meeting a group at StripSteak for happy hour. . Walking up to the restaurant, we were generously greeted by the Assistant GM Miss Ashley and the rest of her hosting staff. Our group was easily accommodated since the happy hour was pretty dead. According to Miss Ashley, that was rare on a Saturday night. To me, it was luck because I would then be able to assess a fair review on this place. . The bar area is fairly small, I would say that the big comfy purple seats do tend to take up a lot of space within that bar area that it really wasn't an ideal place for a group of 8 to be sitting. Plus we made it a little difficult for the wait staff to maneuver around. Their happy hour drink &amp; food menu is reasonably priced. I would highly recommend their specialty, the cucumber martinish drink, it was quite refreshing and a great summertime drink. And this means a lot since I'm more of a beer drinker. The raspberry lemonade &amp; mojitos were just ok, maybe a little to weak, but again that's just my opinion. . My friend and I decided to try dinner so we asked the staff for a table in the dining area and were quickly accommodated. Right away we were greeted with complimentary duck fries, which we also had ordered during happy hour. These fries are cooked in duck fat so don't worry it's not any crazy duck part, which I would have hoped for. There are three different rings of fries - paprika smoked, truffle and garlic Parmesan. The sauces were just ok, it was the general concept of ketchup, BBQ sauce and truffle aioli but of course more upscale. I preferred to munch on the suckers without any of the sauces. . Our waiter, Steve, was awesome. He highly recommended the Rib Cap &amp; Filet Mignon, along with a side of truffle mac &amp; cheese and honestly it was phenomenal. The Filet Mignon was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and just melted in your mouth. The Rib cap, which is the end part of the rib eye, was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The truffle mac &amp; cheese was definitely the best truffle mac &amp; cheese I have experienced in a while. Most tend to be dry but this one was moist and also had pieces of broccoli that it never lost it's flavor. We also had a side of asparagus with a horseradish blanc sauce. I couldn't complain about anything. At first I laughed at the portion size but then as we kept eating I was actually pretty full. Also it might have been the alcohol we had prior to dinner! And me not knowing if you are allowed to take a doggy bag from such places, found the inner strength to finish our food, it truly was like a scene out of Man vs Food. . But wait, we weren't done! WTH? Steve charmed us into trying dessert, I figured what the heck, let's go all out! We ordered the beignets with their chocolate butterscotch pudding. Whew! I think I was getting drunk off the pudding, I might have been able to light a fire. However, the beignets were soft and moist and perfectly fried. . Overall the ambiance of StripSteak is great, perfect for a date or just to people watch from the bar. It did tend to get busier as the night progressed. Yes it's quite pricey but honesty I have to say it was the best experience I have had in a while at a Strip restaurant. Michael Mina did a phenomenal job with this place and all the employees were great. To see the AGM serving drinks, chatting with customers, waiting on guests, cleaning tables and bringing out checks says a lot about the employee morale. She helped making the dining experience that much better. . The only thing I would say is that yes the meat platters need to have a little more presentation. Maybe had a sprig of rosemary or something, just to give it a little more color and pizzazz. . . Food for thought - 1) make sure you have reservations 2) make sure you give yourself enough time to have dinner as our evening lasted over 4 hours 3) if you can't stomach rich food, be aware that some of their steaks are cooked with butter. Yay for TUMS! 4) All sides are al a carte so expect to pay over $100 for a 2 person dinner.","This was our first stop after a long day of travel and finally checked into our room. At this point we were starving. My hubby and I shared Romaine and The Roma. I really like the crust of the pizza and the salad was tasty. In the end, our tummies were full. I would come back and try a different pizza and their calamari.","Nice clean place to grab a slice of pizza. Very well priced very large slices. I have been to this place several times and the staff is always friendly and professional.","I love this place. Great food, beer, snacks, coffee in an actual cup. Sitting out on the patio enjoying a pizza and beer surrounded by the mountains is amazing. The people that work here genuinely care about taking care of you, too. Highly recommend! By the way. . . just order the bread pudding. Just do it.","My parents had been here twice before, so we decided to go again for an early dinner a few weeks ago. When we arrived, the bar was already busy, which is a good sign when it's only 6pm. The atmosphere is very quaint, yet casual, no fancy attire needed here. It was still happy hour ($5 glasses of wine) so we ordered those while trying to make a decision. They were offering at least 3 specials that evening, including a blue crab gnocchi dish which sounded divine. . We decided to share the appetizer tray of meats, olives, cheeses and bread. It was more than enough for the 3 of us and had an array of different items. I was very impressed considering it was an appetizer. It could have been a meal if I had ordered it for just myself!. For dinner we shared the crab gnocchi special and a pizza. The gnocchi had that homemade taste and shape, something you can't hide if it wasn't truly made from scratch. There was plenty of fresh crab, nice seeing the kitchen didn't skimp on the name ingredient. The pizza was also quite tasty. The crust was pleasantly crispy without being hard, and was chewy in all the right places.     . I must say this place is among my new favorites in the area and is much easier to get in and out of parking-wise than LGO.","so, like many of the other reviewers, my family (parents, in particular) saw this restaurant on Restaurant Impossible. . as my mother prepared to graduate from Grand Canyon University with her double major in Special Ed and Elementary Ed (can you tell i am proud?) we prepared for a trek across the U. S. for a mere 3 days, to force her walk across the stage in a cap in gown. . we made reservations for 7:30 p. m. on Friday evening and somehow, even after the long drive -- or what seemed to be like a long drive, hey! it's the desert -- we were early.  we were sat immediately outside in a corner table.  a party of 5 we ordered a bottle of wine as i tweeted away to Robert Irvine, the host of Restaurant Impossible.  ecstatic when he tweeted back to me, he told me to say hi to Gasper and Maria.  at the conclusion of dinner, we asked our server to say hi (i was fulfilling Robert's request, okay? i'm not always this toursity-- have you seen those arms? i'm not going to cross those!). Gasper came over in his whites and Maria with her smile and glasses on her head.  as i showed them the tweet, they were so excited. you can feel the warmth and true love they have for the hospitality industry and how proud they are of their restaurant.  that, my friends, in itself is a great reason to dine there. . now. the food. . the bread was delicious as i cheated on my diet the entire time i was in AZ.  2 orders of calamari later, with empty plates, we definitely enjoyed it.  we are calamari-loving italian family, and we've certainly had our fair share of terrible calamari. . my dad had the clams linguine. what looked like a small portion was not. . mom and sister split the prosciutto flatbrea pizza and my mom thought it was amazing. . GG also had a flatbread pizza that she devoured. . now, as for me. laugh all you want. if charcuterie is an option on a menu, i'm ordering it. no questions asked.  so i did.  i was pleasantly surprised at the amount and variety of meat AND they even had not one, but TWO cheeses on the board -- this was not an additional request, but many restaurants make you have the cheese separate. what ag great surprise and worth every. single. calorie (i just need to remember that at the gym this week). . . post-photo, maria insisted on her homemade chocolate cake although we were going to forego dessert. oh well. i dont even usually like chocolate. and i definitely ate it.","Love this place! Salmon, fried zucchini, garlic fries, burgers, wedge salad, shakes, and BBQ pizza are all favorites. We had breakfast there once and it was great too! Be sure to check them out on your bday too!! Also, this may sound random but the bathrooms are very unique!","Good pizza and sandwiches, delivery was a bit slow but I still order regularly.","Caught a show at the Linq and wandered over here afterward for some grub. Grabbed two slices from the to-go window, a meat specialty and a veggie specialty. . The girl who took my order was friendly, nice, and greeted me with a grin that seemed pretty genuine. Even made some small talk. So that was cool. . However, the food was just excruciatingly unremarkable. I don't expect great from a take-out window, but I feel like f&amp;b could do better. Luke-warm pizza and the toppings had a weird texture and the flavor just kind of. . . blended together. Not worth the $5. 75 per slice. . I would hope that the restaurant inside is far better.","My husband and I moved from the Toledo, Ohio area to Madison last year. One of our biggest concerns was that we were going to miss all of the fantastic pizza places that we frequented in Ohio. You would not believe how incredibly ecstatic we were when we realized that there was a Marco's Pizza in Sun Prairie. Marco's Pizza was founded in Toledo, Ohio, so I feel as though we can speak to how great this location is in comparison. This location is wonderful and Marco's Pizza, in general, is great. We normally pick-up our pizza and drive home with it. Even after the 25 minute drive, the pizza is still great. The sandwiches are also fantastic.","My first experience with Morimoto was a multi-course meal in Philly over 10 years ago. It was one of the best meals in my life. Morimoto' in Vegas is another story. . Here, the servers are not very knowledgeable about the menu. Let your servers taste the menu, Iron Chef. The fish was fresh but the sushi rice was poorly prepared. It tasted like rice straight out of a rice cooker with no additional preparations. To be honest, Nobu has much better sushi.  . In addition, the fried rice was nothing to write home about. It seems like all the trendy restaurants are serving up their own version of fried rice. Well, let me pose a question:  have any of these chefs or sous chefs ever tasted fried rice? Yuck,  Iron Chef. . The standouts on the menu are black cod, tuna pizza, Japanese Uni and flaming chocolate globe. The sake flights were pretty nice too. . I would return only for the sake and tuna pizza in the bar. Otherwise, I might as well go to Nobu for their overpriced but far superior sushi and sashimi experience.","This is a little gem on the outskirts of Leslieville. My friend had been wanting to go here for months now, and miraculously there was parking outside. . . . and free to boot! I'm sure it was well worth the wait and he won't be waiting long to go back, because the food was the kind of comforting Italian that you can just melt into. The menu is simple and concise (just the way I like them because I'm uber indecisive), with the usually antipasti, pizzas and pastas. After a long winded debate in my head, I decided on the beef cheek braised with onions and red wine over housemade pasta. My dinnermate had spaghetti and meatballs. I absolutely loved my beef cheeks, tender enough to break apart with a fork, but maintained meaty bite. I could taste every ingredient in the braise from the gently cooked onions to the luscious red wine. I didn't really want to share my dish, so I didn't dare ask for some spaghetti. But I hear it's as good an Italian sister-in-law. . . . which sounds pretty good to me.","I really enjoy Lucille. I have only been here twice, but both times were pretty amazing. The restaurant itself is just so cool. It's a really nice space. . The fried cheese curds are amazing. They're fried to perfection. I believe we got ranch with the cheese curds. I'd probably like to try the paprika-lime aioli at some point. . For pizzas, we split three among the 7 of us. We got the Southpaw. So, the description of the Southpaw threw me off because it said BBQ sauce. Here I'm thinking it'll be like a sweet BBQ. Turns out, the pizza is very spicy. It was delicious though. The spiciness didn't kick in until after I finished the entire slice. . The other pizza we got was the Umami, which was an awesome chaser pizza to the Southpaw. It definitely made me feel a little better about the spiciness of the Southpaw. The black garlic cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is so unique and really embodied \"umami\". . The third pizza we got was a special - the Kickin' Chicken. I was too full to try it, but I was told it was good!","I love Fat Cats. It's become a weekly ritual for my fianc\u00e9 and I to hit up the $5 movies on Tuesday nights. We always order our tickets ahead of time because Tuesdays are obviously really popular and we like to reserve our seats. We've only seen movies here so I can't speak on the bowling alley but the prices are super reasonable during the weekdays so we're planning on going to play once of these days. Unfortunately, last time we were here they had an SRP outage that wouldn't be resolved for a while so we didn't get to finish our movie. They did promise us to honor our tickets and provide us with free movie vouchers when we go back but we haven't' been back since. Rest assure, I'm getting my \"free\" movie. Their popcorn, drink, and snack prices are much cheaper than Harkins, it makes it so you actually want to buy popcorn instead of regretting having spent like $30 on snacks you know aren't going to fill you up. Fat Cats always has recline and dine where you either buy your food at their attached restaurant ahead of time or order your food to be delivered to you while you watch your movie. It's like personal pizzas, wings, and paninis, nothing crazy but they're pretty good. I would definitely recommend Fat Cats for a movie date or even a family outing especially if you're strapped for cash, you really can't beat $5 to see a movie.","Just so you know ahead of time, they do not offer draught beer. Not one. \"Scenery\" (as in pretty waitress) is nice. Seems empty for a weekend. If I wasn't a Dale Jr. fan I probably would have chosen pizza on the first level. Just got the check, $4 for domestic bottle. Will not be back.","Sampled the flight of beers! All good. Had a wood fired pizza that was very good. Also had the meat loaf dinner. Also very good. Fantastic service from our server Hailey. Glad to have such a nice place close to us. We can't wait to return to try more menu items and sample more well made craft beers!","Finest New York Pizza in Arizona, next to Venezia's Pizza, of course. I have never once been disappointed with my order at Gus's, and I have eaten there many times, at all hours of the day and night. It's great for lunch, dinner or late night. Staff is very friendly, and the place is never too crowded, so service is pretty quick. Great value for your money here too!  Having traveled to New York quite often and having lived nearby for most of my life, I feel my credentials make me an authority on NY style pizza. And I say this place is 99% perfection!  The wings and pizza are both delicious, and their soda's a perfect match. One or two slices will keep you full for hours too!","Went to try this place out and have been wanting to for a while. We ordered hot wings and the classic combo pizza. The wings my boys ate really fast! However, we were not fans of the pizza. The toppings all fell off the pizza. We waited for it to cool, then just chunks of the pizza toppings fell off. They did have some neat stuff on their TVs until natural disasters and bombings in the Middle East were being displayed. Along with the deaths of children. Wasn't the best environment for the other families with kids in the restaurant . So our experience was eh.","I posted a negative review of the pizza, wings, and drink, mistakenly under my wife's account. The owner responded, no offer to make it right, just \"I'm sorry you didn't like our food\" and the he proceeded to defend bad food, slow delivery, a cup of ice(that they called a drink). If your gonna get a bad review offer to make it right for the unhappy customer to try to retain there business, rather than make excuses and say the customer is wrong. I read other reviews as well, and any responses to the bad reviews  were the same, excuses, saying there was nothing wrong, saying how they've been in business for 30 years, blah blah blah. Own it dude, your pizza sucks, your so called jumbo boneless wings that would satisfy a cat, and poor delivery time, and a cup 3/4 full of ice when finished, do not make for \"good food\"! and when I said I have had caffeteria pizza better, I mean it, my school pizza was better than this tasteless, soggy, no topping, cardboard pizza. I moved here from Mi. and I have been looking for a \"good pizza\", so far Pizza Hut is the best I've found in Charlotte. Romanello's is worse than Domino's, at least when I had an issue at Dominos' they gave me my order remade another day for free, and a free item of my choice. So while they messed up initially, they made it right, that is why I will go back to Domino's, but never to Romanello's.","Decor in this place leaves a lot to be desired. It's a mix of old Hayashi booths and some new stuff which doesn't go together. Nonetheless, we are excited to have a brew pub with a great selection of beers. Because of the newness, they did not have their craft beers available yet, but we will definitely go back to try them. Food is good, but overly ambitious for a pub. I'm really not interested in having jicama slaw on my burger or sandwich. Keep it simple. That being said, I had a smoked turkey sandwich which was really very good and the 9 grain bread was outstanding. Would order again without the spread. Husband had beet salad and shrimp ceviche. Again the dressing wasn't great. There is a wood fired pizza oven so will will try a pizza next time. Service is spotty as the kinks are being worked out in a place that has only been open a few days.","This place is my family's favorite ! The food is always on point, place is always so neat and clean . Been coming here for 3 years now Everything we've tried is amazing from their pizza (kids fav) to my fav Giovanni yum! Definitely recommend the calamari, wings, meatball sub, gnocchi, breakfast menu. I gotta rave about their bread pudding , I always get it with  a scoop of ice cream on top omg it's like the holidays in your mouth lol! The Staff is always so wonderful and caring. Always ready to have a great conversation with you. And show you they appreciate your business.","If they only had pizza I'd give it a 3. You get what you pay for. Cheap thin crust buffet pizza. . What bumps it up to 4 stars is the cinnamon rolls. OH MAN.  These things are amazing!  It will probabbly give me a heartattack, but I can eat plate after plate of these things. Warm and gooey. So good. . It can get pretty crowded though. And there are usually lots of kids running around (where are their parents??). Staff is really friendly though. . Macaroni and cheese pizza isn't too bad actually. They also make an apple-cobbler pizza thing that is pretty good. . come for the price, stay for the cinnamon rolls.","The building is beautiful. But you pay for it in the food. Unfortunately the food is not particularly great (especially for what you're paying) 12 dollars or so for an extremely salty procutto pizza with no sauce for one. The bar selection seemed good, and thry had a decent beer selection.","Stopped in for the lunch special. I was going to get two slices and a drink, but one slice looked sufficient, so I went with that. . All the pizzas look like cheese pizza because the pepperoni and the sausage are buried miles below the cheese. You practically need a magnifying glass to see there's pepperoni in it. . Here's where the story ends: One bite, and the cheese/pepperoni came off all at once like a wet blanket, leaving only the tomato-sauce covered crust remaining. Um. . . okay. . . . so, buh-bye to that whole slice of pepperoni as I bought it and hello to a remaining piece of dough covered in tomato sauce. Yummy if I had a hangover and didn't care. Not so yummy if all I wanted was just a slice of pepperoni pizza. Is it too much to expect that cheese and pepperoni to remain on that slice of pizza until, oh, I don't know, I'm done eating it? Shouldn't some cheese and pepperoni remain on that slice for a second bite, and third bite, and a fourth bite, and a fifth bite, until I'm done eating it?. Taste-wise? Well, not sure how accurate my assessment would be as I had to chew it all up all at one so I didn't spit it out and then re-eat it (because that would be gross. ) But I did taste a lot of cheese. And I could tell there was some garlic in it. Sorry I can't describe the taste with any more accuracy than that. . Peter Piper Pizza is better than this. Heck, even a frozen pizza is better than this. If I ever return, I will be sure to bring a knife and fork to be sure I don't lose that slice on the first bite.","The staff and the food were EXCELLENT. The Chicago pizza was very tasty. I am not sure whats in the crust but it only added to the pizza! Thank you RWB!","Super friendly staff, great tasting pizzas. I can  see why this is a Scarborough staple. Would gladly return for seconds (and thirds. . . )","This is some of the best pizza I've ever had. I would rank this right after some of the deep dish pizza I've had in Chicago. Ingredients were fresh and plentiful. Pizza had a unique and great taste. Staff at the counter was very friendly. Menu was decent and prices were reasonable. Would recommend!","Ordered pizza for a group of 15 from Pop Up. I agree with other Yelpers. . . organization doesn't seem to be their specialty here because the order over the phone seemed to take at least 15-20 minutes. However, staff on the phone were pleasant, pizza arrived when they said it would arrive, and delivery guy met me outside the Golden Nugget where I was staying. Despite the long over the phone order, I thought the service was pretty good!  And the pizza was REALLY good!! Slices are huge. My group enjoyed the pizza and we had tons left over for the next day. I'd order from this place again, but I'd definitely allow at least an hour to place the order and have it arrive in time for dinner. Yum!","Quality food and a really good size for the price. Paid around $18 for a really decent sized pizza with good ingredients. Cute interior, good service.","Went here to see what all the hype is about. The food was good but dine-in is very limited to several tables. . I ordered the pizza burger and I felt they could have added a few more spices. The taste was bland and luckily I choose to add the extra topping supreme which gave it a little more flavor, but what do you expect from a vege burger. The burger was hard to eat because once u take a bite all the toppings would fall out the other end; I had to resort to a fork and knife!. Overall, the service and food was good.","Where to start, waited 45 minutes to be seated, although there were plenty of empty tables, five in our group, one ordered chicken sandwich, 3 ordered hamb, I ordered pizza after another hour cold food was delivered, but was informed they couldn't make the pizza due to bad dough, did I want to order something else? Might have 45 minutes ago, but at this point just wanted to go home, were entertained by a group of rowdy ten year olds playing corn ball, not a great Sunday night, and no manager ever appeared to apologize, they did comp my tea","Cute place, really good pizza with fresh ingredients. Mushroom and prosciutto pizza was delicious. Good selection of beer on tap. Only waiter seemed a bit disoriented - I asked for a glass of beer but ended up with a pint.","Love this place. We've been there twice in the past week. Wine selection is amazing. Happy hour prices are great. The pizza is right up there with the big players in town. Had fun visiting with Nick. It's connected to the Hilton Garden Inn which is worth checking out.","This is my favorite pizza place! I love eating here because it's delicious and a great place in general. Love it and definitely recommend eating here.","We were a little apprehensive to order based on some of the past Yelp reviews, but we are glad we took the chance and ordered!  The food is AWESOME and the delivery was fast. We ordered a supreme pizza, wings and garlic balls and all of them came hot and ready to eat. They added napkins, forks and also enough ranch to enjoy everything without even asking. We will definitely be ordering from them again!","Excellent addition to the neighborhood. $7. 75 for any pizza or create your own with as many toppings as you like. All one price.","Food: 3. 5/5. Atmosphere: 3/5. Service: 3/5. Overall experience: 3/5. (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic). Normally, I would turn a blind eye to this dive-like bar, but my coworkers brought me here for lunch; it was their 1/2 off medium or large pizza special every Wednesday. Great deal for tasty pizzas if you like a medium thick crust (a 10\" medium normally costs ~$15). . You can choose from various toppings which they load onto the pizza; I decided to get the Stolo's Special with beef, pepperoni, shrimp, onions, bell peppers, olives, and mushrooms. The pizzas came out fairly quickly, piping hot with a light and crispy crust. . Unless you have a big appetite, a medium can be shared with someone else without feeling overly full. Our server was sub-par, and the atmosphere was relaxed with the bar's regulars. . If you live or work in the area, I recommend trying Stolo's pizza for their 1/2 off special.","I love this place! Great thin crust pizza!. Amazing Happy Hour with many selections!. I had my Significant other 50th birthday party on the patio! Our Server Heather was. A Rock Star! . Sorry I didn't take pics of our food but. Everything was delicious","My wife got super dehydrated from the heat and alcohol in vegas. She could not hold any food or water down the next morning. I remembered seeing this spot on the way to uber pick up the night before. She could barely stand up and i didnt want to stay in our tiny room all day so I hit up Revive. Ouch! 150? I really wanted her to feel better and we both wanted to see this treatment in action. Wow! They gave her a b12 shot and then sent her into a dimly lit room with a lounge couch, big tv, blanket with netflix and hooked her up to an IV. There were more expensive options available but this one was sufficient for her condition. 30 min later she felt 100% better! It was like they turned on a light switch! Such a relief for her and I. We immidiately walked across the path where she was able to devour a whole pizza and 2 waters after treatment and kept it down! We were able to spend the rest of the day on the strip and at the pool. Definitely recommend this to anyone hurting after partying and need to get on with your day! The ladies that worked there were also really nice and caring so that always makes it a better experience!","Amazing wood fired pizza. They have red chilis they give and they taste delicious on the pizza. The kids and adults loved this place. Our server Gian Carlo was the best!!","The staff are very friendly but the quality is mediocre at best. They put so little cheese on their pizza and it's mostly dough. Unless it's your last option late at night. . . this is a skip.","Michaelangelo's is basically a grocery store that also has a hot table and salad bar. I work really close to this place and will frequent it when I am looking to have a healthy lunch. I am a fan of their salad bar which has quite a big selection that ranges from quinoa salad to a basic Caesar. My favorites on the salad bar include their 3 bean salad, quinoa salad and crab salad. I am a sucker for olives and this place has a great olive bar that I can never resist visiting. . Their hot table foods are mediocre at best, and their pizza is just ok (if you want a good slice try the Longo's across the street). They also have an extensive dessert section that carries, cupcakes, cookies, cakes and even truffles. I have had their cakes and they were pretty good but not amazing. . On the grocery side this place has some funky and gourmet items that you will not find at your regular grocery store. Their produce is quite fresh and not overly pricey. They also have a butcher and the quality of their meat looks pretty good but I have never bought any meat here. . This place is never that busy so if you are in the mood for some quiet grocery shopping or need a quick bite this place is a good option and a great alternative to fast food chains.","I stayed here for business.  . DISCLAIMER: I didn't realize that Venezia is essentially one of three towers owned by the same org. Other reviews mentioned a dedicated reservation desk; I saw no such. I checked in at the Venetian, and they put me here. . Its location is ridiculous, as others have noted. But the real issue is signage. It's confusing. There are terms used on the signs that don't match terms people say. So someone will tell you \"go across the bridge\" and there's no sign talking about a bridge.  (it's actually a breezeway that doubles as a bridge, between Venetian and Venezia, and is IMO the fastest way to get between the two towers). The other issue is the elevators are all sparse and use confusing button terms. So the towers in Venetian will tell you that they're taking you to the \"Venetian Lobby\" - that's fine. But there's nothing in the elevator indicating exactly where you need to go to get to the \"Venezia Lobby\". Vice versa on the Venezia elevators. What I'm used to is, \"Venetian Lobby, access to Venezia Lobby\", or something similar. Not here. . If I had a warning, I would say to stay away from Venezia anytime there's a boxing event. This particular business function is scheduled right during Mayweather's fights, so you can imagine the nightmare that ensues. Tons of people, drunk people, stupid people, etc. The Venezia gets literally beat up - someone had peed in the hallway and they just put a fan out there to dry it out. NO!  You need to get a steam cleaner ASAP to get it up off the floor, THEN do a dry when it's been cleaned and odor removed!. You'll have teen girls sitting out barefeet in the hallway blocking access, laughing and chatting at the top of their lungs (which of course reverberates into the rooms) all through the evening. . Heaven help you if any of these teen girls or even 20 somethings get a room next to you. It's not fun to have their 20 something male buddies banging on the door at 3am. Nor is it fun to experience their music literally vibrating the walls. It IS moderately funny to watch them nearly injure themselves running into closed elevator doors because they're so drunk.  . I would STRONGLY recommend requesting a full linen replacement before you sleep in that room. In my case, while the bed was made and the sheets and pillows appeared clean, they all smelled like. . . well, imagine what you'd end up with if some basketball player went straight from a game, skipped the shower and went to bed. That's what it smelled like, even the pillows. Not good at all. . Whatever they wash towels with, I'm assuming they don't use soap or wash powder. They smell rancid and unclean, even after you request replacements. . WiFi kept throwing auth errors - even though you don't need a password. . Verizon 4G, though you can get signal, is unusable. It simply won't work. . In-Room Dining is a price nightmare. You'll see a price for $19, but then there's a \"delivery charge\" of $5, \"service charge\" of 18% and tax of just under 10%. So you'll get very close to $30 all told and that's NOT including a 20% tip (which you really should do at this kind of place). One plate I recall was over $60 just for the food - ordering that would have been high side of $80!  For ONE plate of food, just some seafood and a steak!. No coffee maker in the room and none for breakfast unless you buy a full pitcher. Why?. . THE GOOD:. WiFi is part of the resort fee. There's a card that swears you'll be billed; technically this is true but it's not per-hour or whatever. You're charged the resort fee anyway, use the WiFi all you want, and you don't need a password. . The room does look nice, with decent furniture. . Shower was comfortable and heated up nicely. Unlike some others I experienced (Omni Parker, I'm looking at you). . Sound isolation from outside was about 95%. This is excellent.  (too bad the inside didn't fare so well. ). What I did try of the in-room was actually very good. The brie cheese was nearly perfectly creamy, the fruit was reasonably fresh, and I really should have listed to the server. He swore up and down that I wouldn't be able to finish two club sandwiches, and he was absolutely correct. They're massive and delicious, but I simply couldn't finish more than one. Too good. I guess the days of eating two medium pizzas by myself are long gone. The only thing I got that was \"meh\" was the porchetta, and only because I'm picky about it. But the antipasto - which I found out later was the \"sausage and cheese platter\" that Omni Parker serves - was actually good. Didn't smell like a gym locker, tasted good. Didn't finish it because there was just too much to eat. . The In-room servers are the shining stars. Excellent service, polite and will go out of their way to accommodate you.  . If you stay here, just keep an eye on your wallet and the noise levels, I guess.","Great pizza . . . its Tasty and the wings are awesome too. They always mix the bbq and buffalo sauce for me which I love. Rays pizza, my new favorite joint!","EXCELLENT HOUSE SALAD AND THE HOUSE DRESSING IS SIMPLY OUTSTANDING. Bought a bottle to take home and bring back next visit to refill. 2 very large excellent cherry coke and Dr Pepper . Not the fake watered down kind. The real kind. 4 piece bruschetta egg plant appetizers very nice. 14\" pizza deluxe with everything. Fresh fresh ingredients with a layer of bottom and crunchy crust that is thin with a soft bread under the soft cheese. A lot better than the old UNOs and the ratings are on the money. Nice friendly service and take home for a second dinner. The small salad is large enough for 2 twice and the dressing from the bottle they brought out was large and unique and we poured out the whole bottle on the salad. Best salad yet in any restaurant with GRIMALDI'S medetterian salad in greenfield being almost equal. Very casual atmosphere","I don't normally review chain restaurants like this, however, I really thought it was necessary after my experience on July 3rd. My husband and I dropped by to grab a couple of pizzas and breadsticks that evening and the service was really great. The guy who was working the register was awesome. He was so professional, greeting everyone who walked in the door immediately. He kept us updated on the status of our order because they were super, super busy during the holiday weekend and had to pop in some fresh pizzas to keep up with everything. Overall, I just think it is rare to find great service and was super impressed by this guy, so I had to review. Only 4 stars because while the pizza is fine for a chain, it is nothing crazily spectacular (perfect for a lazy family night in).","Let's start with good food great wings and cold beer , , be back next time with the family . . they told me that they have the best pizza in The Valley , so I'm gonna check it out soon. 2nd time here . . . wings and beer great , , I order de Italian sausage and I got a piece of meat deep fried !!! Guysss your killing the flavor of it , no flavor taste like plastic come on , put it on the grill or the flat top but don't deep fried it !!! Thanks","We've been coming here regularly every other month or so since they've opened. The owner, Tim, is a great guy and he makes sure every customer is happy. Wait staff is always friendly and efficient. Matt the bartender isn't afraid to go off menu and make some interesting drinks tailored to your likes. . This has always been a \"cheers where everyone knows your name\" kind of place for us with good modern twists on bar food. The ingredients are always fresh and local as much as possible. Our favorites are always the patty melt, the steak salad, and the mad Hawaiian pizza--they make some pretty awesome pizzas out of their pizza oven.  . They just hired a new chef to lead up the kitchen and Tavern Americana is bringing their A game. We were in two weeks ago and the chef had a special of home made chicken and dumplings. I wasn't too sure about eating such a heavy soul food dish when it's 110 degrees out but I thought I'd give it a try. I was so glad I did. Flavorful broth, fresh veggies, tender chicken, and dumplings as light as air. It reminded me somewhat of my wife's matzoh ball soup which is about one of the best things I've ever had. . We were in last night to see what else chef Ian had in store. We tried the pasta Bolognese special. It was fantastic. Home made pasta cooked to perfection. The Bolognese sauce was rich and had a deep meaty flavor. This is one of the best pasta Bolognese dishes in town--I'm not kidding. We also had the fried chicken, which is only on Fridays. Wow. Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, yet not greasy at all. For dessert, another one of chef Ian's new additions--a sort of deconstructed bananas foster bread pudding. The four of us were literally arm wrestling for the last bite. . If you haven't been to TA in a while--check it out and make sure to try what chef Ian is cooking. You'll thank me later. . And P. S. --if you like bourbon, ask Matt to make the western rye (not on the menu). It's kind of like a Manhattan. Has some bitter, has some smoke. But first he coats the inside of the glass with some absinthe to give the drink a licorice finish. If you have a few, you'll thank me later. Just make sure there's not a huge surge in uber.","I was a bit disappointed with The Bread Company. I ordered for pickup and even though I was absolutely starving (which normally makes the food better) I was still unimpressed. I usually expect homemade pizza to have a thicker crust, which I can't fault the restaurant for, but the pizza itself was kind of bland. I ordered the margarita pizza, which by looking at it you'd have no idea, and there wasn't much there. Instead of the ingredients being somewhat separate but still working together, they were all a blend so you can't experience the each of the flavored. I also ordered the asparagus fettuccine which was supposed to be topped with Parmesan but it a soft cheese, more like feta. This made the whole dish sour and unappetizing, especially because it wasn't in the description. . I would come back to try the fondue because it's the only place around here, but I don't know if I'd try anything else.","Barro's is always awesome. When I call in an order its usually ready faster than they say it will be, and their meatball pizza is delicious.","The Sandwiches and othe dishes looked great, but we had Pizza and Wings. The WINGS are AWESOMEand the wing sauces! I had a thing rust pizza, and the table also ordered 2 18\" pizzas. The Toppings were great, and complimentary garlic bread sticks were great. I love thin crust, but according the rest of the table the best thing about the NY pizza are the toppings and that the dough and tomato sauce were good, but not great. In the end our expeience resulted in WINGS outweighted Pizza. . . but totally worth going to, and the visit. . . next time we're in town I hope to try the sandwhiches and pasta.","Dude, this place is legit (not to sound so d-baggy). Here's why. . . . 1. Recently remodeled/ upgraded hotel (not swanky--just think an janky old hotel with new floors, decor, tv, and furniture. Be warned--the bathrooms seem to have been left off the remodel list. Old shower/ bath/ fixtures/ toilet. Our sink was actually leaking. . 2. Clean. No carpet in the the super basic rooms, so I actually feel it's cleaner than one with carpet. Linens were new-ish and still white. No down comforters. Just pink throws that looked like a Muppet was skinned. . 3. Location. Center of the strip, basically. Quick-ish walk to Miracle Mile Mall, PH, Cosmo/ Marquee, etc. . 4. Mediocre pizza place right next to the elevators. Umm. . . can we say, lifesaver?? . 5. And my favorite. . . Cost. This place is cheap! We expected a LOT less when we booked, but ended up loving the Flamingo by the end of the weekend. . Perfect spot for a quicky (cheap!) trip to Vegas with a small group of friends! Will definitely be back whenever we're not trying to pretend we be fancy. Ha! . Warnings: Walls are PAPER THIN. Wouldn't bring my family to a spot like this. Also, there isn't much of a selection for food. . . you're going to have to walk outside the hotel if you're trying to eat good in Vegas.","My business is very near That's Amore, and without a measure of planning (which is usually beyond the scope of my skills on any given day) I wind up sometime in the afternoon realizing I have neglected to eat anything all day, and have no idea what I'm going to do for lunch. Now, you can only eat SO MUCH pizza in any given week. Seriously- trust me. I have experience with this. So, much of the time, I'll order a sandwich from That's Amore. My particular favorite is the Italian sub (I get it without onions or dressing). I've also had the meatball sub a few times, which is great too, but messy. There's just some days when I know from the start that I do not have the organization I'll need to keep a sloppy sandwich from landing on my clothing. Still- the meatball sub is a pretty good bet anyway. The pizza is good, though I prefer it when I have someone to share with and can order a whole pie instead of slices. The slices are good too, but given a choice I'm not a fan of warmed-up pizza vs fresh out of the oven. The pies are good sized but on the greasy-gooey side, which IMO does nothing to detract from the taste but will make you think twice about skipping that workout later. . I've found the staff to be friendly and personable, and there have been times when I was too busy or just too tired to go over to pick up my order, and they've happily brought it to me. Now, granted, I'm something of a \"regular\" and a local business owner, which may tint my experience somewhat, but I've been happy to continue to do business with them and there is nothing like a nice, hot Italian sub when you're starving. They also have a selection of soft drinks and a surprisingly full menu of salads, sides and entrees along with the pizza and sub menu.","I love the pizza there  (thin pizza freshly cooked). I find it affordable especially for a restaurant near the oldport. I would definitely come back for pizza if I am around there.","The pizza is always good, but when management allows them to reuse coasters to the point of them being moldy on the table, it makes you wonder how clean the kitchen is.","After a long day of travel - didn't feel like a dine-in. . . . I grabbed a pizza from Rays!  I walked in and ordered, had a 20 minute wait for the pizza. It was worth it!  Great pizza at a fair price!","Stopped here after a volleyball tournament with three hungry girls and we weren't disappointed. We had wings- really liked the Thai chili was so tasty- the Caesar and house salad both were good and a large pizza which was excellent. Service was reasonable and the staff was very friendly. The only real problem was that all the food came out at the same time even though I ordered the wings as an appetizer. By the time we ate the wings and salads and tackled the pizza part of it was a little soggy. I would also strongly recommend they invest in some spatulas to serve the 18\" pizzas. It would just be much easier to serve than using the small plastic knife. We'd go back again. I'd just make sure to order the pizza after the wings came out.","Excellent pizza done very quickly would give it 5 star but my kids weren't big fans which means a lot since we usually go out as a family pannis are good but the pizza is star friendly staff smaller pizza so each person can what they want i wish my kids liked it better so we could go more often almost always go for lunch if it's just me and hubby","Pizzas are good, wings and subs are great. Price is a little high for a restaurant like this but you can sometimes get coupons. . They also have a good deal on an extra large pizza and a whole chicken's worth of wings if you're trying to feed an army.","worst restaurant experience this year. The food is bland, frozen pizza crust,  barely edible. The salmon sandwich was sickeningly sweet; who marinates salmon in sugar?? There is no rhyme or reason to entering this place and figuring out where you're supposed to go and where you're supposed to order. I'm sure it would be fine for just a coffee or beer, but I highly discourage ordering food. To make matters worse,  I asked the cashier how long my food would take when I ordered, she said 7-10 minutes- it took 30. No apologies other than \"sorry we're real behind. \"   . I am not outrageously picky,  but the three things we ordered were all unappealing. I like supporting local biz, but come on people. . oh,  and coffee sucked. The end.","We were walking back to hotel when we passed this small Italian restaurant and decide to eat there especially when we saw other customers food which appeared to be appetizing. The offered fresh garlic bread, which was delicious! We ordered the calamari which was really good yet bad for you because it was fried. The texture of the calamari was soft, well seasoned and hot. The shrimp scampi portion was huge. Depending how you like your pasta some like it with some flavor but I like my pasta with flavor. I guess the only good part of this is that they didn't use that much butter! :) The shrimp however was perfect not over cooked, nicely stuffed and well seasoned. We also had the Salsiccia pizza which was delicious. It's a pretty small restaurant that serves pretty good food. But when the employees speak Italian you kind of know the food is legit.","Went here for a happy hour. My friend ordered a pizza and I ordered a chicken salad. The salad came out about 10-15 minutes before the pizza. That was a little annoying because I was hungry and didn't want to be rude and eat in front of my friend. So I waited until here pizza came and by then my chicken on my salad was cold. If you can even call it chicken, it was rubbery and gross. But my friends pizza was good, I like th crust. Even if the chicken was warm the salad was still pretty gross. The beer selection is ok but overpriced unless you are ya there for happy hour. Overall I only like this place for the pizza everything else is mehhh","The plaza where it is located is a bit run down looking with a \"gentlemen's club\" one door down, so is a bit scarey. We went on a Saturday for lunch and there were very few people there and at first wondered if they were even open, but they were. We were there for about an hour and not once did they put out any fresh food. There wasn't even any one back at the grill to cook!  . The food was OK but not great. The souvlaki was dry and not hot so had probably been under the warming lamp for quite a while. There was a decent selection of salads but only 2 fruits (pineapple, honeydew melon, and cantaloupe). The hot foot selection was pretty limited with a small grill area and a bar with moussaka, pasta, rice, and stuffed peppers. They also had pizza and spanakopeta. The desserts were good but there were very few choices and the ice cream (3 flavors only) was awful.  . I won't be back and wouldn't recommend it. I would rather go to Mr. Greek and order fresh food.","I just moved into the area, and everyone always rants and raves about how amazing Benny's is. I thought it was 100% local just because of how much of a hometown feel is in this place - even though they have other locations, you just feel the Pittsburgh charm of this one. Enormous slices the size of your head. Quick service. Games always on TV. Youthful crowd - which gets pretty loud and crowded on weekends. . Staff is incredibly nice and everyone working there is very charismatic. Makes you feel right at home. . Only real complaint is the $5 slices. It's a little insane. I'm a originally from Bronx, and we have slices just as big for $1 in New York, but hey, the pizza is pretty alright. Overpriced for how it tastes, but it's still wicked good. A definite \"must-eat\" if you're in the area!","Went to see AntMan today! Took Mom and we had lunch at Pizini before the movie. We did buy our tickets and pick our seats before lunch. The cashier was not super welcoming, I had to ask where do we go? How do things work? At Pizini they seemed to be overwhelmed at the register, but the pizza and salad were fast and fresh! The pizza was thin and toasty, made in a brick oven! Once we got to our seats we were happy to see comfy leather recliners, it felt like I was at home! Movie was great, although during quite parts you could hear noise through the wall. I wasn't excited to see unattended children running around like crazy at the entrance either! I would go back for pizza and a movie, next time we will take pizza in to see the movie!","This place has really gone done hill and they make no apologies. I have ordered many a pizzas from here and service has been like a plane crashing. Last few order have taken over 45 min to pick up from the time I ordered them. One time it took and hour and 11 min. No apologies and every time I asked about my order it was the same response just 5 minutes. It was five minutes 20 minutes ago. Come on. You guys didn't make my pizza yet. I've just moved on.","Our family dined here after my sister's graduation. It was nice of them to move our reservation up on such short notice but after eating here, I understood why this wasn't a problem. . If you're called \"The Bread Company\" you probably shouldn't serve burnt bread. The crust of our Italian bread was burnt. Though the bread was good otherwise, leaving a charred taste in your patrons' mouths is not the best way to start a meal. . When my sister made the reservation they did not inform her that there wouldn't be a full menu that day. So though we looked at the menu online beforehand, we were only able to order from their limited graduation-day menu. . There were seven of us and we ordered vegetarian dishes. Three of us had the grilled portobello sandwich with raspberry aioli and brie ($10), which was served with a side of salad greens and roasted potatoes. The presentation and portion-size were perfect. The mushrooms were fresh and juicy and the raspberry aioli went well with the brie. Those who ordered this plate seemed satsified. . The other four of us split two pizzas: the roasted garlic with san marzano tomato sauce and Parmesan ($12), and the pesto with portabella, artichoke hearts and brie ($15). The reason we split them? Our waitress said they were 10 inch pizzas. They were actually smaller, about 6-7 inches in diameter. Now I usually love a cracker-thin crust, but ours was burnt in places. The roasted garlic pizza was at best a decent cheese pizza and the pesto with portabella and artichoke hearts did not benefit from the addition of brie; though it added texture, the brie did little to compliment the flavors of the other ingredients on the pizza. Overall the ingredients seemed fresh, but I've had much better thin crust pizza for less money, and more of it too. . Though the restaurant seemed full, the same people were dining the whole time we were there. Only one party arrived while we were dining. It's a small place and there only seemed to be a server or two but seeing as it wasn't really busy, you'd think service would be more attentive. Our waitress was not. She was pleasant. She refilled our waters once and brought another basket of (still burnt) bread upon request. We were not asked if we wanted drinks or dessert. And we waited for our check for about twenty minutes. Turns out she went on lunch and took our check with her. We didn't gyp her on the tip at all--seeing as it's a college-town and they were probably short-staffed on graduation weekend, and we weren't running late for anything--but we certainly won't be dining here again. . Side note: they do not accept Discover. . Taking everything into consideration, I'd give this place a C+. I'm sure there are better white-cloth restaurants in Champaign-Urbana and you'd be better off eating there.","I had been hearing so many good things about Bevo and I have to say i'm happy I was finally able to give it a try for myself ! They mainly serve Italian dishes like Arancino, Risotto , pasta and pizza etc. They have a nice selection of classical and more out of the box options to choose from. . Pricing wise, it is very reasonable, especially with consideration to the fact that the portion sizes are great and the quality of the food and service is there. Our server was friendly and attentive to ensure that we had everything we needed. . The decor inside is casual but still very pretty  with high ceilings, exposed brick and chandeliers. Great for a date , for groups or for families. The only thing was that for such a big space they do try to have as much seating as possible, so while it doesnt feel crowded in when you're sitting down at your table, it can be tough to circulate through some section. we did get our chairs bumped into more than a few times by some of the other guests. (Keeping in mind that this is a small detail and did not ruin the overall experience). I had a peach bellini that was absolutely delicious , not too sweet and so refreshing ! Their veal poutine is a great choice , tender braised veal and their own spin on the gravy , so well spiced with lots of stretchy tasty cheese and perfectly cooked fries. The flavour was great but not overpowering so you can enjoy every bite to the end without being overhwhelmed. And of course , a pizza addict like me couldn't come to Bevo and NOT try one of their pizzas! I had the Formaggio Di Capra E Spinaci (goat cheese, spinach, tomato sauce&amp; sun dried tomato). The dough was nice and thin , cooked in a wood oven, it had great texture flavour, and a great balance of all the delicious toppings! . All in all this was a great experience in all aspects , definitely coming back here again !","Back in the old neighborhood, and had to stop in for a slice. Awesome as ever. Just can't get pizza this good in PV.","Amazing pizza! I absolutely love coming here to order their monstrous sized pizzas for a low price.","The pizza is great and the value is great also. It's nice now that they opened a dining area. Employees are always friendly and courteous. It's also cool that they serve chips and salsa for everybody.","This pizza is the bomb! Hands down my favorite pizza in Charlotte. It's so good, every time. Some of my other favorite menu items (on the rare occasion I can talk myself into NOT getting pizza) are their wings and stromboli, and my husband is a sucker for their tiramisu.","Stopped in here for some food before heading to the airport for my flight home to east coast. Had the special 2 slices and a drink 4. 95 and yes it was great pizza","A pretty modern place in a nice location, if been meaning to come here for a while. It didn't really live up to my expectations food wise. We had the mussels and the margherita pizza and it was okay - just that. The margherita had wayy too much cheese and wasn't spread evenly. The mussels had the green curry flavor so that was something new and exciting. The waiter was also very friendly. . Overall, a good place to go for lunch if you're in the area but it's not somewhere id go very often.","After making an order online, I found a hair baked into my slice of pizza! Immediately, I became disgusted and ruined my whole families appetite and mines. I called and talked to the Manager Billy who was completely unprofessional and arrogant, he then demanded I bring back the pizza (we threw this pizza away) or else he couldn't replace our order. After explaining that I threw this pizza away, his response was \"What are you trying to get something for free\"? I have a history with Pizza Hut and they can look up my number and I have never asked for a refund of any one of my orders, I am a hard working man who don't need a $7. 99 pizza for \"FREE\" all I wanted was to provide my family with dinner of their choice. After all the other options there is in laveen, we will be ordering Barro's next time and EVERY TIME after! See my picture I attached to this Pizza Hut if you don't believe me.","What a wonderful hidden gem!. My boyfriend and I have been here twice and we have raved about it both times. The service is wonderful - the employees are patient, kind and helpful. The food isn't 5 star, but it IS really really good and, best of all, cheap as hell!. Sure the pizza may not be cut into \"pizza shape, \" but that doesn't make it any less wonderful at all. Everything I have ever had here is wonderful and I will definitely be taking multiple 30 minute trips back here to support this independent business.","I've been to Scaddabush quite a few times and while the atmosphere is nice, the food is just okay. Here is a list of everything I've had here and its rating out of 5. . *Appetizers*. Calamari - 3/5. No spicy mayo or chipotle??. Chicken Parmesan Bites - 2/5. Would not try again. . *Mains*. Margarita pizza - 3. 5/5. Basic, good. . Sophia pizza - 4/5. Second favorite main here. . Brick chicken - 3/5. Extremely salty. Not worth the price. . Lobster Spaghetti - 4/5. Best main though it's very oily. . *Dessert*. Tiramisu - 4. 5/5. Yes, this is good. Comes in a mason jar. Super creamy, strong coffee flavor, no lady fingers. . **Final verdict**. Go here if you feel like having okay/good Italian food and you don't want to shell out too much dough. That was a joke cause I said dough and this is an Italian place. 3/5 overall.","Just so we can get this straight; this is the ORIGINAL Nello's. The others are franchised and they really just can't hold a candle to this location. After a series of bad experiences at the location at McClintock and Southern, the hubby and I made the trek to this location, hoping for a better outcome. We were immediately greeted and took our seats at the bar. The bartender got us drinks right away and was very quick and extremely friendly throughout our entire meal. The owner, Brian came over and talked to us and was very friendly talking to all the other patrons. They either have a ton of regulars, or the people that work here are just super friendly. The salad and pizza were just as I had remembered them to be. They were cooked and served properly and quickly. This is the location we will be frequenting from now on!","Good pizza, pasta, and wings, but if we have a next trip we'll avoid any pizza using spinach as a topping. The waterlogged frozen/canned spinach very nearly ruined our perfectly acceptable thin crust pizza. . The server was super friendly and on the ball even though she was running the cash register, packing up take-out orders, and waiting the entire (tiny) place.","We live in the neighborhood so had their flyer handy. The pizza on the flyer looked delicious so decided to order it (margarita pizza). Turns out they don't have that pizza and don't have basil at their restaurant. False advertising and the pizza wasn't great. Not going to order from this place again. More for the false advertising than the pizza itself.","If you are looking for a gooey, cheesy thin slice of pizza this is the place. The atmosphere has a well worn authenticity about it that is charming. Bottom line. Super yummy by the slice pizza.","Tried this place and absolutely love it. Price was amazing. The food was exceptional, the owner very friendly and an easy to park plaza location. The cheese and zaatar as well as their pizzas are amazing and very filling. Tried the lentil balls which was phenomenal too. If you haven't tried this, do so! You will love it.","We went here on a Saturday night as a group of 12. We were seated in the corner of the back room, which was perfect seating because we were able to be loud and not bother every single table around us. The staff was very accommodating while we wait for our whole table to come. I ordered their Flamm, which is a type of flatbread with toppings on it, similar to a pizza but not as heavy on the dough! I had the prosciutto and potato one, and it was delicious! I would definitely recommend that pizza with some chili flakes of course. We all ordered their beer or their beer coctail, since that is what they are known for. It seems that everyone really enjoyed the different types of beers. One person even ordered the 1m beer, which came with a gradient of beer from light to dark. It took half the table to finish it, but I think it was worth it if a bunch of people wanted to share something different. . Overall the atmosphere was great for a work outing. The food is mediocre and nothing special, but a great place to come and catch up with friends over a great pint of beer!","Last night I ordered my friends and I some pizza. I opened the box to find a short black hair laying there. The pizza did arrive on time and the delivery guys are always nice but seeing the hair made me lose my appetite. Hopefully this isn't a common occurrence.","How did I miss this gem? I've been driving past Cyclones Pitas daily, for years, and I just tried it for the first time. WOW, I'm sure glad I did! This place is wonderful and I'm already planning what to get next. . I had the Thai Chicken Pita: spicy peanut sauce, chicken, cucumber, avocado, sprouts and lettuce. $6. 99! Portion size was just right, not super big, but not small by any means, it was just right. I really enjoyed everything about my pita from the freshness of EVERYTHING on it to the perfect packaging. Spicy peanut sauce wasn't to spicy, so don't freak and not get it because of the \"spicy\" thing. It really just had a slight, really slight almost a hint of spicy, nothing a little kid couldn't eat. Veggies were as fresh as they get and complimented the chicken and peanut sauce perfectly. I really liked the avocado in this pita, I think it gave it something extra special. Chips and fountain drinks as well as coffee are available. I think I saw some yummy cookies too, but I was too excited about my pita, I forgot to get one :( Maybe next time. Vegetarian options also available!!!. Customer service was friendly, speedy and overall nice! Not a single complaint. The one thing that caught my eye right away was the cleanliness of Cyclones Pitas. This place is spotless. Not only is the food great, but I can feel good about eating it, knowing I'm not in any danger of some horrible food borne illness. You really have to see inside for yourself, to know what I'm talking about. Outside patio with several tables, can't wait for spring. Oh, last but not least FREE WiFi! Who doesn't love a patio, good food and free wifi?!. Prices are decent, no more then $9 for a pita or pita pizza. I'll pay $9 all day for a pita.","This was my favorite burger place, but they recently got sold and it has drastically changed. They no longer have the build your own burger menu, which is okay, but when I went with friends they didn't ask us how we wanted our burgers done and my friend's was very well done, The burgers look like they're just frozen patties now, and my friend ordered a pizza  that looks like it was just one of those Stouffer's type meals with a slice of cheese on top, and our waters had a metallic taste like it was from a hose. At the end of the night just before we left a large loud group of drunk people came over and several older women decided to get a picture of them flashing their breasts while sitting on a skeeball machine, while the staff was in the back.","Roccos pizza is delicious and Monday's extra large pizza special is a great value too.","The salad was delicious as I made my own with grilled salmon, dried cherries, walnuts, almonds, portabella mushrooms and romaine lettuce. I like the outside tables and the beer choices. It's a casual place and would be good for families where you can order sandwiches, pizzas or salads.","Great pizza. One of the best pizzas joints in town. Family friendly, friendly staff, fantastic priced specials. Mushroom pizza is my favourite.","They have an amazing vegan Soho pizza. Probably the best vegan pizza I have tried in Vegas so far. The slices are pretty big but I recommend buying the whole pie, it's worth it. . Pros: decent price, delicious and open late. . The Soho pizza was the only vegan option however. When I asked if they had vegan garlic knots, they said you have to come early when they are making them and ask them not to put on parmesan cheese. Pretty annoying that they can't accommodate for other menu items to be vegan, but oh well it was still good. . Cons: only one vegan item, staff was okay, inside a casino.","Decent pizza. The crust was kind of bland but the cheese and sauce are great. The large is actually more of a medium.","I have literally spent thousands of dollars at Brisam's over the last five years I have lived in Cave Creek. Last couple times the food quality was meh. . . it happens. Last night I went for a quick dinner, was seated at 8:00 pm. Was not overly crowded, I had to enlist the assistance of a server from another area to receive water at my table at 8:30. Server took order, and showed back up at the table at 9:00 am to explain the pizza my husband ordered without onions was made with onions, and despite his efforts to pick them off, they were going to have to start all over again. Never offered me my salad, or anything. . . after sitting at the booth for over an hour????? I walked out. Today I called and asked to speak with a manager, and was told that if I want to speak to someone who cares to call back tomorrow between 11:30 and and 11:45 am. I'll save myself the call and post this here. Never going back, and it is sad cause I can walk there from my home.","Great food for the price; we use Rocco's to obtain food for casual parties at home. I love the Stromboli, lasagna, spaghetti, and the pizzas are good for mass pizza consumption in groups. Be sure to call ahead as there is not much room to wait, and be sure to call the correct Rocco's as there are various locations.","What a delicious place! The pizza is always good and has a variety of options. Our favorites are the clark street (meat) pizza, carne asada and the rosemary potato. My family and I also had the Mexican salad(not the full name) but it was very yummy! Thank you for such a great experience!","since ive been on this pasta kick lately, my husb remembered this tiny little italian spot right by the house so we decided to give it a go. . . walked in on a saturday night around 7, and they were super busy. . . only took us around 15 min to get seated.  up front they have a glass case filled with freshly made desserts - cookies, cannolis, truffles and such and a fridge w/italian sodas, sparkling waters and lemonade.  the seating area was decorated nicely and place was super clean.  . we were served these tiny little bread rolls and olive oil w/herbs and we started off the meal w/a caprese salad. . other items we ordered were:. *chicken parmesan. *linguine frutti di mare. *margherita pizza. *spaghetti w/meatballs. everything was so delicious and we were soooo pleased w/the meal.  star of the show was definitely the linguine frutti di mare!!! it had so much seafood and the sauce was insanely good!!!. our server was awesome and btwn her and the bussers our drinks and bread basket were never empty. loved it!! highly recommend. . ugh, this was one of the times i really shouldve snapped pics but we were so into the food i forgot :/ lol","Urban Baker is a little bakery on Edmonton Trail with an obsession for baking with chocolate. A lot of their items are infused in one way or another with Bernard Callebaut chocolates. Like their croissants with chocolate baked inside. . . . . But they also offer sandwiches and have a huge wood-fired oven for cooking their original pizzas, including one with banana peppers and italian sausage. . It's a quality place.","I have never been unhappy after a meal at Cibo! I've been three times, and have sat twice on the patio and once upstairs. The patio is a lovely terrace that makes you feel like you've stepped right into Italy. Except, unlike Italy, the service is fantastic!. The food. Oh my goodness. The pizza! I'm salivating thinking about it. It's a thin crust piece of deliciousness. You can get a bunch of items from the menu and share, or hoard it all to yourself. Either way, you win. . I have nothing bad to say about Cibo. Just go! You'll be so happy! I want that happiness for you!","I always get my pizza and rice balls TOGo ! There food is so good !! Yummy - luv t rice balls !","I have delivery-ordered a Veggie Pizza (with spinach and sausage) from Happy's Pizza on three occasions within the past few months over your mainstream pizza joints, such as Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, Dominos, etc due to the fact I enjoyed my Veggie Pizza (with spinach and sausage)! . Every time I have ordered a Veggie pizza from other places, I usually complain how there is not enough veggies (what can I say? I love my veggies!) but Happy's Pizza has proven to be different. From the three occasions I have ordered my pizza, it never fails - FRESH veggies are overflowing on top of each other! . I should try other dishes to give it more reviews, but what can I say? When I'm in the mood for pizza, I call Happy's!","Came to California Pizza Kitchen because my work was having a fundraiser here. We've been a few times before and it's always fairly mediocre. CPK is not my favorite pizza place, but it's just alright. Oh and to be fair, they have more pastas, salads soups and etc than they do pizza.","I've only been here twice, both times for the gelato. It's a quaint little cafe with a very hipster vibe from the lighting to the potted plants. They have very interesting combinations for gelato that will catch you off guard, but the way it compels the tastebuds to reconcile with your brain what you just ate in gelato form makes me smile. The ricotta, rosemary &amp; lemon flavour is a must-try. I'll be back to try it's pizza and cafe offerings another time, and of course more gelato.","I love this place! The pizza is very good, the house salad and salad dressing is super yummy and for the most part service is really good. Here is a great secret that I will share with you. The house salad dressing is super yummy. I like to buy it and take it to go and then serve it to my house guest, everyone asks \"what type of dressing is this\"  of course I tell them that I made it. LOL!!","I was excited to try this place out. Thanks to a newly acquired allergy, I'm living the gluten free life these days, and anywhere that caters to me and my fellow sufferers, is worth trying out.  . I placed an order online for a Friday night pick-up. Keep in mind, I don't exactly live close, but was willing to make the drive. My order was placed several hours before pick up, and consisted of one gluten free veggie pizza, and one traditional veggie pizza, for my niece.  . I left a little early, to stop and do a little shopping along the way (why make a trip for only 1 purpose). As I pulled into the parking lot, it was easy enough to spot, considering how tiny this place is. I walked inside, checked out the modern decor, and waited for someone to appear. As I identified myself, I could see things starting to look bleak. The guy helping me out (who didn't introduce himself, &amp; didn't have a name tag on) let me know that they were out of gluten free pizzas, but would be happy to make both my pizzas traditionally. I can see this person doesn't understand why people eat gluten free in the first place. Obviously I was confused, and probably starting to look displeased, and as I started to ask, \"What do you mean you're out of gluten free pizzas?\", he interrupted me to let me know that they tried to call me and tell me. Strange. . . I didn't hear my phone ring. I took my phone out of my purse, and realized they called me 4 minutes before I was supposed to pick up my order. Now that's just ridiculous. They had to know I was already there, or almost there at that point. Now I'm just ticked. First off, who runs out of gluten free?!  Second, you obviously knew you were out, but didn't call me until I got there?!  You had more than 2 hours to call and let me know. Wow. . . . . now I'm just speechless. . . mostly because I'm hungry, and pissed, and afraid I might spontaneously combust at this point. Although this twit has no idea about customer service or food allergies, I doubt incurring my wrath will do more than scar him for life, plus my niece was there, and lord knows that child needs a good role model in her life, so I leave hungry, and disgusted.  . IF you're going to make part of your business model selling specific items that cater to allergy prone people, MAYBE you should do a better job of educating your staff, and MAYBE you should do a better job ordering supplies/ingredients, and MAYBE, just MAYBE, you should all learn what good customer service entails, because I guarantee you that experience I had could NOT have been any worse. If I could give you less than 1 star, I would.","Review update:. Still 2 stars. . The good:. - Pizza is good (especially for delivery pizza). - Not that expensive (definitely not cheap but considering the quality of ingredients, I think it's an inexpensive price). - Driver is always polite. The bad:. - Estimated delivery time: 610pm. Actaul delivery time: 530pm. This is the opposite of the usual Pizzaiolo experience. Why wouldn't I consider this a good thing? Because now I'm used to getting the Pizza 90m from when I order it, so I order it and plan to do other things before it arrives. They have taught me to expect it to take forever so I work around that. The inaccurate/often ridiculous delivery times are really frustrating. . - My pizza had the wrong toppings on it today. It was still good but it wasn't what I ordered. I double checked my online order to make sure I hadn't made a mistake in their crazy-stupid online ordering system (it's a series of 100 radio buttons) but I hadn't. . Overall, I will still order this pizza again, and I guess not know when it will be delivered or what I'm actually going to get, but I'm sure it will still be good. . I always want to order their wings but I never do.","I am not to happy with this location, I ordered pizza thinking it would be delivered fresh. . First thing was it took them nearly 2 hours to deliver and Pizza Hut sent me an email stating it was just going to be 45-60min. . Second, when the pizza was delivered it tasted like old pizza, as if it was sitting in the drivers car for awhile. . Overall, not just they're service was terrible but the quality of pizza being made at this location isn't acceptable to me.","As with most businesses, there will be good and bad reviews, and hopefully I can come back at a later date to write a good one. However, my first experience with Gus' was quite negative. . I ordered a pizza online, gave the card number to pay for it and received a confirmation/order number. The pizza was supposed to be delivered within an hour. An hour later, no pizza, so I called. Gus' had no record of our order, no specials and no website, or so I was told, and yet, I was looking at the website as the employee was telling me they didn't have one. I went to the bank and sure enough, money had been taken out to pay for pizza at Gus'. I called again. . One of the most curious things was the different stories I got depending on the employee I was speaking to. During one phone call I was told that the order was on its way. I waited. Nothing. I called again. No record of the transaction, no order placed, no pizza on its way. I inquired how a pizza could be \"on its way\" if there was, allegedly, no order placed. I was placed on hold several times as the employees desperately tried to get answers to these questions they could not answer. Finally the manager. No record of an order placed, yet paid for. An interesting business practice. . Needless to say, it was a frustrating experience and an investigation is under way. The funds should be returned in 2-3 business days, but for now, I have no access to them and no pizza. . Think I'll stick with Papa Murphy's; for delivery service is like a box of chocolates-- you never know what you'll get, or in this case, if you'll get.","Food was disgusting the only reason we went there was that we bought a restaurant s. com voucher where you save like 20. 00 dollar s so we decided to try it and we ordered a salad , dozen wings , large pepperoni pizza . The lettuce was old the tomatoes where mushy , the wings tasted like they've been sitting for a while , and finally the pizza was flavor less nothing on the pizza stuck out . But that is not the worst part nasty food aside THE STAFF DECIDED TO ADD THEMSELVES A 30% TIP never going there again","Went here on a Friday night at 9pm. There were two people in the whole place, so service was good. We ordered wings, the veggie pizza and an italian beef. Let me start with the wings, they were bland but crispy so I wasn't too upset at this point. The italian beef was just horrid. It was super salty, more than a sandwich with au jous sauce should be. My husband, who eats anything wouldn't even finish the sandwich or take it home in a doggie bag. The pizza tasted like it came from a microwave and after one measly slice I pushed it aside and asked for a doggie bag (because while it wasn't appetizing it was still edible). Was hoping to support a locally owned business. I just overall did not like the food and wont be back.","The Cleveland Museum of Art is a place you MUST VISIT if you find yourself in Cleveland. If even if you are not a fan of art/art museums, you can't but help appreciate the architecture of this beautiful building. The grounds and surrounding area are also magnificent. . I really enjoyed seeing Rodin's \"The Thinker\" on the south side of the building. I also loved the Monet's, and the section with all of the armor. . The museum is home to art going back from hundreds of years before the birth of Christ to the 1990s. . . . . They have a section for children to learn about art as well as an area that shows movies and hosts concerts. They appear to have events on Friday nights with music, cocktails and appetizers. . They have a nice cafe that offers everything from tandoori grill items to hamburgers, pizza and mac and cheese. They also have sit down restaurant that offers a full bar. . I ended up getting a cured meat flatbread pizza that came with side of argula with a lemon dressing. The pizza was ok. . Admission to the museum was free. There was a fee to see the special exhibit. . They also have a very nice gift shop and coat check available. . Plan on spending a few hours admiring the art work. It will be well worth your time!","Excellent wait staff and great food. We come here all the time for the pizza, wings, salad, beer and wine. Great food at a great price.","Had a late lunch, early dinner here. Casual dining with some nice beers on tap and LOTS of whiskeys. The other reviews that said you can order slices. . . for clarification, thats's for 'to go' only not dine in. There are a few stand up tables nearby where folks were enjoying their slice. For two of us dining in, we shared a chopped salad (about $14) and a pizza (1/2 &amp; 1/2 for us each to pick our favorite toppings). The salad was good, fresh, and satisfying. Not huge, and not a lot of the salami and other things, mostly lettuce. The pizza, mmmm. . . as others were being delivered around us, we could hardly wait for ours to arrive. It didn't take too long and bam, great pizza arrived looking and smelling great. It had a nice crisp crust, and just the right amount of sauce, cheese, and toppings. The mushroom pizza was great - creaming and cheesy. The meat lovers (name I can't recall) was the perfect version of itself. For a casual meal in a hotel, the ambiance was great, felt like a nice local brewpub with pizza. The price for 2 beers, a pizza and salad came to about $70, so not cheap, however very good.","I've been told by a couple people to come to this spot for some pretty solid pizza. These couple people though. . . they swear by pizza. I figured I needed to see what was rising here. . First glance as I walk into the Pi Co restaurant is that sweet oven they chuck those bad boys in. They're not the same ones you see at a big chain pizza joint though. Much more authentic looking. I was already salivating at that point. . I wanted to take a crack at the make your own pizza thing, so I went face first into the Californian Tomato Sauce with a drizzle of BBQ Sauce, basil, spinach, onions, roasted red peppers, spicy soppresata, bacon and ground sausage. . Let me tell you. . . I won't be offended if you pick the same ingredients. I liked it a lot, and I'm sharing it with you too. . The pizza was really delicious - dough was thin and just the right amount of crisp, and the ingredients really tasted fresh and savoury. Maybe it's because I chose my own ingredients. . . who knows?. I'll definitely come back!","I always try to look for the best out of a place, but it was difficult to find the good in the Treasure Island buffet. We decided to try it because we had the 2 for 1 coupon from the hotel, against my better judgement after checking yelp. The place was clean and simply decorated so we felt comfortable. The first problem was that there was a long hair in the tongs to get pulled pork, when my husband told the person behind the counter he just smiled and said \"ok. \" We tried a little bit of everything from the BBQ section, we got slices from the pizza station, and salads from the salad station. All of the meat was dry and visibly old. You could tell it had been sitting for an extended period of time. The pizza tasted worse than Chuck E. Cheese, and the Cesar salad dressing was salty and tasted horribly. The dessert was ok. We had some cookies and sweets and they weren't bad. Another thing that I didn't like is that I heard the waiter in our section speaking very rudely to tourists who didn't know much English, which I find extremely offensive. We were so annoyed and disappointed with the experience that went to complain but there was already someone complaining and yelling not at the manager that we didn't want to wait. Needless to say we will never go back to this buffet or recommend it to anyone.","Always love Oregano's and this location is my favorite. We love to go out to the patio and sit at the bar. Their outdoor bar is tucked in the corner so it's not as hectic when you sit there on a busy night. I recommend splitting a pizza in half with 2 different styles. Last time we tried half Clark Street Meat, and half Rosemary Chicken Potato. Also, the Italian gold wings are the best.","Our go-to date night spot, and we have introduced family and friends as well. Have yet to come across a single menu item we haven't loved. Pasta is fantastic, pizza is great and our favourite appetizer is the Funghi Ripieni. Highly recommend!","Not sure how anyone can really enjoy deep dish pizza. . . waaaaaayyyyyyy too much crust to eat. It's kind of like eating a loaf of bread.  . Their thin crust pizza is serviceable.","Best pizza in my neighborhood. I could eat here every day. Yum.","Wanted to love you Stevie's but your sauce was sour and got us sick. Pizza is okay but not 100. I go there when we're in a pinch and really desperate for pizza","I came in for an early lunch. I sat at the bar and had the most pleasant opportunity to chat with the Manager Vince and Bartender Jarred. The food suggestions and education I received was priceless. Vince suggested the meatballs and the Kale and anchovy pizza. I don't do anchovies so I declined and went with The Parm. OMG so good. I could not finish it so it will be leftovers. I am so glad to stop in.  #newfan","Good pizza yes, great pizza no. Gas fired rotating oven Ritchie look, not true to the name. They are close to a fired pizza but not there. The crust gets soggy quickly, although the crust taste is great. Al in all I will be back.","Passing through town on a road trip and found this place thru Yelp. Not only was there super cheap gas for a fill up at this exit, this place was way better than any of the drive through places that I'm glad we didn't get.  . The pizza was the perfect size (not too big or small) and really tasty. We got one with their homemade white sauce which sounded sketchy but turned out to be so good. We also got these potato wedges (can't remember what they're called) but definitely get them! And since this was the south - we ordered a perfectly seasoned and crunchy fried chicken piece to eat as well. . Really tasty- we called and timed it perfectly for us to pick up as we were rolling through rock hill - stop at the exit for the cheap gas and delicious pizza pie.","This is just a chain of the new pizza places kinda like Blaze Pizza. . . pizza was really good, fresh and crispy and the the ingredients on top were good as well! Very dark inside at night I would say but overall a good atmosphere for a quick bite to eat. Prices are OK too for a restaurant pizza made to your liking. . . you get what you pay for is my moto!!!","It was a weird night blaze pizza had a line out the door five guys ran out of hamburger buns and I just started driving in circles and found this place so I was not in the best of moods and I ordered it to go it's not like Hawaiian restaurants/chains around town have really thrilled me but it was packeand had awesome reviews so far. The staff  were very friendly pointing to the specials on the board which look interesting like a mahi-mahi  but I have my mind set on the short ribs and I got the teriyaki chicken 2 item combo basically for $12. 50 I got three of the better tasting and thick Short ribs I've ever had and some very tasty teriyaki chicken and rice along with some macaroni salad. Everything was delicious very hard for me to give any restaurant like this a five star, but at this place stays consistent l,  it might make it there. . So I went back for lunch and even better, the short ribs and furikake (sp?) chicken, wow now 5 stars. And the 3rd time now is just as tasty!!! Go-go-go","Great service, clean and friendly atmosphere. The most important: the food was on point. We ordered calamari, pepperoni pizza and arugula with kale salad. And for dessert the Dark Chocolate Bombe. All good in the neighborhood!","This is a mixed review. First, the pizza was very good! Very good thin crust, crust was not soggy and it was perfect really. I liked that I can pick different types of slices for my meal. The bar is a big boo. I got a glass of Chianti (they didn't have a red zin), and sat to eat, leaving my tab open. I wanted a second glass but the bar was unattended. It stayed unattended, as it was when I arrived (pizza guy called the bartender over when I got my pizza initially). Forget it! What does the bartender do back there??","I'm here with my hubby, enjoying a Primavera pizza. We both enjoyed the thin crust, and flavorful pesto pizza with several filling toppings. We are always fans of all things pesto. He really enjoyed the garlic bread with cheese and a side of marina. Next time we hope to try their regular tomato based sauce and possibly the crostini bread. The service was also good, which adds to the experience!","I'm surprised at all the reviews related to poor service. There are several Pizza Huts in the area and we usually go to this one even though it's a little farther for us because their team does such a great job (not only in terms of friendliness, but also with the pizza itself). Plus, the stuffed crust pizza can't be beat!","I have been going here since I was a kid! Consistent quality, and just plain delicious while also being a bit addictive. Their pizza is sicilian style and light as air, which I think is much better than when sicilian pizza is too dense. The outside can be easily mistaken for a garage and I have passed it up by accident. I love it!","Very good wedgies and pizza is ok just a little too greasy. . People aren't real friendly except the owner is very nice.","Whoever said this rivals New York pizza must not have any taste buds! I'm actually from NYC and this place is worse than any place I've ever been to in New York. I went to this place when I was visiting Montreal with friends and this place was down the block. I got 2 slices (one bacon and the other chicken). I ate the bacon one and was not able to finish it. It made me sick. If this is good for Montreal pizza then I would suggest not to eat pizza in Montreal or at least don't compare it to New York. Go to Montreal for the poutine not the pizza.","Living in vegas we don't tend to eat out on the strip but as we had friends visiting from out of town we spent a day doing the tourist thing!  Came across Cafe Americano the other night and decided to stop for some dinner and drinks. I ate the giant meatball and my friends had a Cuban sandwich and a pizza - food was so tasty and although a little high in price we expected it for Caesars Palace but to be honest I feel the price was worth it. Drinks were tasty especially the espresso martini!  The best thing about this place is the service - our server was Danielle and she was excellent - such a nice lady and incredibly attentive to us. We were also checked on by the manager (can't remember his name but he was British) - he stopped and chatted to make sure everything was ok a couple of times. Will definitely recommend this place to my friends!","Fun place! Bowling, a bar, arcade, &amp; recliner  seat movie theater. We come here, get a drink, then see a movie. You can order pizza at the concession &amp; they will bring it to your theater.","I was visiting Las Vegas last week with my two sons for a guys trip alone without their mother. We stumbled upon the Orleans to check out Emeril's restaurant that in there. My youngest son loves bowling so he spotted the bowling alley, the only one on the strip I believe, although I am not sure. Upon entering the alley, the attendant Cannon was very helpful assisting with bumpers for my youngest son to bowl with. The bartender Cassie was so nice, and friendly. She seemed overwhelmed and busy all night but always made an effort to get my drinks spot on and had a smile on the whole night! I couldn't believe how attentive she was! We ordered pizzas and they came out perfect and fresh. On my next trip to Vegas definitely coming back to bowl with the whole family! Great alley","hot wing pizza!  . . . just what i was craving, . we ordered carryout on a sunday. . . it was ready in twenty minutes.  we ordered an antipasto salad to start. . . which wasn't too thrilling.  but the pizza made up for it!  each slice was a meal in itself. . will definitely be going back. :)","I wanted to give them a one star for their terrible service but they comped my meal and sort of earned 3 stars instead. . I ordered online, after 30 min wait, went there to pick up, waited 15-20 mins after paying for it, only to be told that they had 1 of 2 pizzas ready and the other one not even started. They said they had to make it and it would take as much time as orders in front of mine. REALLY? Orders pending for 1 hr OR people who ordered AFTER I came into the store?. The manager was courteous and refunded  the amount and I walked out with 1 pizza to feed a hungry family instead of 2 :(","I thought all was lost when I moved out of ktown in LA to the little hot desert of Phoenix. Where was I going to get my Korean friend chicken? Korean pizza? The cheesy corn??? Well you might not be able to get all those here, but all is not lost. . I had a lot of reservations coming here, but it was a birthday dinner and I hadn't had Korean food in a while and was having major cravings. At first, I was a bit miffed by the prices, but all that soon melted away. We ordered family style with the pork belly, hot stone bulgogi bibimbap and budae jjigae (army style hot pot). The portions here are gigantic! The bibimbap is definitely made for at least 2 maybe 3 people, and the soup is made for more like 4-6. The food was also very good. Good level of spicy and weren't stingy on the sauces. Ban chan was also decent, although I thought the Kim chi was ok. Food got an A for tasty, and very reasonable prices. . . plus complimentary fresh fruit dessert!. I also enjoyed some drinks like makgeolli (banana is surprisingly a very delicious flavor recommended by our server) and hite. I was hoping for baekseju but alas, there was none. Service was excellent - very thorough, attentive and friendly. . Overall, a pretty solid place for Korean food and drinks in the Phoenix area with very reasonable prices. Menu isn't as expansive as I'd like but I'll definitely be returning and exploring more of the menu. And I'm glad I've found an excellent place to satisfy my Korean food cravings. Oh and did I mention they play kpop too??","-2 stars for having to wait to be served (wondering if we were forgotten) and for not seating people well at tables which increases the wait time before you sit. +6 stars for some of the best authentic, delicious, hearty, amazing pizza I've had in a while. While my family was bummed that we didn't get a \"real brunch\" since Delucca's and Pamela's were ridiculously long wait times, the awesomeness of this pizza (Mediterranean style). . =4 stars!","Most of their food is really good. However I do not like there pizza at all. Their garlic knots are probably the best I've ever had!","Love Pizza Nova pizza. Good variety of pizzas to choose from. Their tomato sauce makes it taste so good. My go to Pizza place is always Pizza Nova. They are delicious.","Walking into esthers kitchen it seems like home, waiters are nice, it's a very mellow, relaxed place. Onto the food, I'm not big on pasta and I figured out why when I had pasta here. Now I was hesitant on the pasta because I'm very picky about sauce. Yet, I wanted to try my friend's pasta because I truly like Esther's kitchen because it seemed like the food would be up to its atmosphere. It also helped its my grandmothers name and she makes good pasta, I had expectations for this establishment. . I had some of my friends pasta ( he was nearly finished with it when I decided I wanted to try it ) and I really liked it. The noodles weren't overdone, the sauce was thick and not watery ( I dislike watery sauce ) the flavor was there! After eating here I've had pasta at other places only when I know the sauce is thick. . I will be returning to Esther's kitchen again to have their pasta. . Onto the pizza, it was crispy, tasty and oh so cheesy. I'm a big fan of their pizza and the size was just right to not be overwhelming.","Nice interior atmosphere for the restaurant although the men's  bathroom was a little on the trashy side. Starter salad was very tasty. Cauliflower pizza was a little bland although the regular pizza was top notch. Service was fast and very friendly. Over all a good experience and we would definitely come back.","I am so sorry to hear this store is closing for good. I had always been a fan of Fresh &amp; Easy since it first came to existence. This particular store in Southern Highlands was my favorite. Especially after they remodeled it. The made to order pizzas &amp; the freshly made sandwiches were delicious. Quality brewed coffee &amp; a great selection of baked goods &amp; pastries. Especially Carl's donuts. An ample of specialty foods &amp; wines too!! What a shame and too bad they could not keep this Fresh &amp; Easy open, despite being the only store that made a profit from the entire chain. I will miss the very helpful &amp; friendly staff as well. This store became my \"go-to-pit stop\" for breakfast &amp; lunch items to take to work. I hope they open a Trader Joes at this soon to be vacant store. Southern Highlands could sure use one!!!","Had cheese stick, wings, and pizza and all of it was good! The only reason why I wouldn't give it a 5 star is because of the cashier, she had a face like she didn't want to be there, should smile:) . And everyone complaining about the 3. 99 pizza, you ain't forced to buy it, there's plenty of other food places","I was sadly not as impressed with this place as many of the other reviewers would suggest. The place is under renovation which I have no problem with. The bar tender who also served us was very pleasant and helpful. While she did forget the french fries that were supposed to accompany my husband's meal, she did quickly get them out to him. I had a side salad which was fine but I think that is hard to mess up. The Lucy's pierogi's were tasty and I would get them again. I think the menu was misleading with the two other items I tried. First, the whiskey and cheddar Mac n cheese tasted like Alfredo from a jar only it tasted worse than that. My sister in law got a pizza which was supposed to have fresh mozzarella but it was definitely just regular pizza cheese. The sauce was sweeter than expected for pizza and was also greasier than I prefer. . I personally wouldn't suggest going here but I suspect I may not have ordered their best dishes and would be to give it another try in the future.","Try most things. I've never had the fish. Don't have to have the shrimp again. The wings are fabulous for us. The subs are okay. The pizza options and sauces make life easier for us. . From purchasing the once a year deal to buying something off the menu to getting discount notice for paying with cash. . . . Glass Nickel wings, Fetalicious with Sausage and new monthly offerings - sets the standard for others.  . I'm shocked I haven't written a review before now but this location has a vibe to it's own.  . More suburban I'm apathetic to all things but nothing nasty or rude. . We've only ordered delivery from this location for work purposes and they go to Middleton. . Also part of the barter program.","When i looked this place up, i was expecting a restaurant separate somewhere downtown. Turns out it's inside a Hotel near the slots. I ordered a vegan pizza that was too greasy. Sad to say, I didn't like it. :/ Heads up, first 90 minute parking is free.","Solid pizza. Nothing spectacular but pizza was tasty and came out quick after we ordered. Caesar salad was great and service was good so all in all a good experience for just spotting it off the strip.","If you have not been to Esther's Kitchen yet . . . . . . go!  It is amazing everything  from the amazing food to the drinks the hand made dinner plates,  was outstanding . The place has a very inviting atmosphere . Last night I had the pleasure of sitting at the bar and talking to Sonia fantastic bartender. I had  one of the new pizzas but the best part was the POLENTA !!!!  it was amazing , incredible, addicting. They asked me \"did you like it, was it good\"   Good doesn't cover  it  , I could hardly speak.","OMG! Still hands down THE BEST Chicago style pizza on earth! I would seriously fly to Chicago just to get Giordano's. I was so happy they happened to have one in AZ!!! I just wish I had known this when I still lived there!!! Can't wait to go back! I'm going to bring pizzas (yes, plural) back on the plane with me!","Rude people specially name m. c no customer service skills at all . . It took 2 hours to deliver my pizza &amp; my soda &amp; the delivery driver asking $5  tip so i gave him 5cents i told him share that  to youre co workers, . . . .","Awesome food, friendly staff and the room in the back area was super cozy on a rainy day. The tortellini was fantastic with the rose sauce which was very flavourful. We also like the margarita pizza. I would love to be back to give a try to other items on the menu","Our order was simple pepperoni pizza it was very good  . . . the crust was overdone as expected but the flavor was great. The price was above average for pizza so I won't be returning to often but I will eat there again. .","An amazing place great service and holy tv's batman!!!! Food was excellent. Service even better, the owners put together one heck of a fun place. Off track betting is a plus!!! The Mexican pizza is excellent, draft beer ice cold.","Love this place!!!!!!!! I always get pasta!! Shrimp Alfredo is my all time favorite !!! My husband loves the pizza ! Such a tasty place with a cool atmosphere","Definitely one of the best pizza places in ahwatukee. One thing that helps them stand out is their house sauce. Order it on the side with any pizza and you will be begging for more!","This is one of my favorite places for pizza and wings. Occasionally it can be a little too greasy which is why I have it 4 stars, but still better than Pizza Hut or dominos!","Great pizza. Yes, it's busy, but it is a new location and there's a shortage of great pizza places near by. So glad they moved in.","Always the best. Great food and service. The Fire and Brimstone pizza is amazing. Fun place to sit and enjoy a great meal.","Solid pizza. Hand tossed, not thin. Crust was pretty crispy. Sauce wasn't anything special. Best part was the meatballs. Definitely getting the meatball sliders next time.","I came here for lunch, a coworker said they had good lunch specials, so why not. I ordered the two slices and a drink for 4. 95. You can also get a salad and a slice of pizza for a few cents more and that comes with a drink as well. I ordered pepperoni, it was very hot and fresh, the pizza crust was great and crispy. My slices were large, could barely finish it. I'm going back today and going to get a salad this time. Perfect little lunch spot.","One of my first jobs in life was making and then running a pizza place. I travel all over eating pizza , BBQ, Steaks, etc. . . I even took my family to Naples's, Italy  this June to eat the best pizza in the world which by the way turned out to be the worst pizza we've ever had and the worst part of our trip. Anyway I've been staying at the Aria for several years now. So when they added a pizza place I was over joyed and hoping it would be good. The restaurant it self is very lively and well decorated. The wood fired ovens make a great back drop as you walk in. We were seated right away since it wasn't that busy yet. We ordered a Pepperoni pizza and Coke's. Yes Coke in Vegas again at a place that is dominated by Pepsi. That was one of our favorite things about this place. But the  pizza was seriously one of the best pizzas i had ever eaten. I only wish I hadn't eaten pizza the 3 days before so I could've went back again before we had to leave Vegas. Our waitress was also very good at her job. I can't wait to eat here again the next time I'm at the Aria. Like most of the places at the Aria it's not cheap but worth every cent. One large pizza easily fed my family of four. Believe me my kids can eat some food. Must visit if at the Aria.","The pizza is great and the salads are yummy!! I recommend the peperoni and sausage pizza and a BIG house salad. The dressing is awesome and I like to dip my pizza, its better then ranch. Good service and great food, what else can you ask for.","Date night at Charbar was a good idea! We went for a later dinner, around 9pm on a Friday night but it was still bustling. We had made a reservation so the seating process was quick. We decided to share a few things, so we got the provelata, beef chorizo pizza and the octopus with romesco. The provelata and pizza were fantastic. I would highly recommend the pizza, the crust is fantastic and fluffy, the toppings are simple but so flavorful. I wouldn't order the octopus again. I adore seafood of all kinds and the dish was underwhelming, bland and frankly over priced for 2 tiny pieces that were done in under 2 minutes! We had a couple of beers, the selection is good. Service was decent. I would go back again at some point!","I have been coming here for over a year. It's not the greatest pizza but it is very good for a I don't feel like cooking let's get pizza","Well, before they allowed people to choose their own toppings, no one could order what they wanted. I was not allowed to substitute bacon for prosciutto, so I had to order something else. When they finally did allow people to choose their own, I was joking to my friends about how it might end up costing $30 for one pizza. And it did (for about 3 toppings). At least I could make a joke about how un-humble the pie was. It wasn't even that good, there are many other places, like Parlor or Spinato's, that have great flavorful pizza, so it doesn't make the most sense to eat here.","Restaurant review. My luv for the cheddar bay biscuits have gone on for many years, but I find that my enjoyment of Red Lobster continues to dwindle a little bit each time I go. At one time red lobster was the apex of chain seafood restaurant where you went for an \"expensive\" seafood meal, however a lot has changed and now it is a higher quality restaurant on pare with Outback or Longhorn. The long waits that use to exist have melted away which is nice. Our family of four was seated on a super long table which gave us plenty of space to spread out. Our waitress took our orders without any issues, but again we had the typical conversation . . . are drinks included with the kids meal . . . No . . . but it says it right here they are . . . I don't think they are but I will get you one anyways. . . The food itself was okay, the obligatory caesar salad was dressed well. Finally the biscuits arrived with the meal. My seafarer fest looked a little different then the menu item with it haphazardly thrown together in the picture, but maybe I am to blame as I did not get the broccoli and opted for the potato which threw off the arrangement. There was no hot butter to dip my lobster which I did not realize until now after looking at the pictures of my meal. Overall the food was okay, the shrimp scampi was super salty as usual. All and all I think with y time to time cravings, I will head out to Red Lobster to get some cheddar bay biscuits along with whatever seafood meal looks appetizing at that time. Pros: variety of seafood dishs that include lobster tail, scallops, shrimp. Cons: Plating of the meal does not look like the website, occasionally slow service including timing of the biscuits to the table. Hidden deals:.

Health code rating: C some issues with food stored at poor temperature, hand hygiene etc, but it is to be expected given the large restaurant. https://il. healthinspections. us/champaign/estab. cfm?facilityID=648","This is a new restaurant in the Mirage Hotel and sadly needed although two others have closed leaving this hotel with not very many dining options.  . However, this is a new avenue for this hotel and trending towards lighter and brighter and upscale but not pretentious Italian food. Not sure why it's called Costal Italian but it is. . We were seated promptly but had used Open Table to make a reservation which I recommend. As always in Vegas you are offered their filtered water or bottled. I see nothing wrong with filtered. They have a good menu of starters to share as well as salads, pizza, pasta which is house made and entrees.  the server was very knowledgeable and told us about the menu and then added that there were two kitchens, one for entrees, and the other for pizza and pasta so things might come out at different times. Good to know. We each ordered a salad, huge, and we could have ordered one and split it. As it was I only ate about half of mine. Nice vinegrette, too much grated cheese and primarily lettuce with a couple of tomato pieces tossed in. Hubs had a Caesar which he said was ok. . For entrees I had sea bass which was cooked perfectly and it was the entire fish and of course I could only eat about half. I ordered a side which was an eggplant something or other and not very good. Hubs had lasagna which he said was really good but huge portion and he couldn't finish it. We didn't try any desserts absolutely no room. I had wine, he had beer and the bill was just a bit over $100. Not too bad for a hotel in Vegas","Good pub. Nice to experience happy and responsive table waiting. Beckham's makes it. look easy, by making a good pizza with generous topping choices at a fair price. One of my favourites is shrimp, feta and mushrooms. (I haven't had many other items on their menu). How hard can it be?! yet so many other pubs just don't get it. Bravo Beckhams.","Came here for pasta about 6 months ago, pasta was not that amazing. . . . . A week ago ordered pizza to go and WOW it was great. Came today with friends and service and pizza was just great, will submit photos of food","I'm truly surprised by the low reviews, maybe Phoenix wasn't quite ready for Chicago deep dish. I thought it was incredible, much better than Lou Malnati's. It takes 45 min to cook so check out the menu in advance and order right when you get there. The pizza itself is very thick and cheesy, very rich but super delicious. Service was acceptable it was very busy when we went, ambience was very nice it's a good location near arrowhead","This review is solely for the happy hour menu. Visited PT's during their midnight happy hour and I have to say the SRIRACHA CHICKEN BITES is heaven sent! Perfect little chicken balls with just the right amount of sriracha breading. Order that, ask for the sweet chili sauce (recommended by the bartender) on the side with a full pint of blue moon and your night is made. . Flat bread pizza had good taste but I'd prefer it to be a little thinner and crunchier than what I got but that's just me. Loaded potato skins were pretty good, too. Haven't tried the other ones in the menu though. . Oh, did I say get the SRIRACHA CHICKEN BITES?! It's the type of dish that you will definitely crave for every so often. Okay, gonna go get some now!","I've been here a couple times to order the Buffalo chicken pizza which is simply amazing! We tried their regular pizza with pepperoni and green pepper and were seriously underwhelmed with the sauce flavor. . The other night, we ordered 2 large Buffalo chicken pizzas for the family, 1 large with pepperoni and green pepper and an antipasto salad. The total was $79!!!!! I about had a heart attack but I knew how good the Buffalo chicken pizza was and we were splitting the cost amongst multiple people. We were told 25 minutes so we showed up at exactly that time, only to get home and our pizza be cold, lacking toppings, and dry. It was some of the worst pizza I've had in a long time. . It was extremely disappointing considering how expensive the pizza was. My suggestion is to focus on their pizzas without their sauce and to eat it in the restaurant so that it is not cold. . . and overpriced.","Saw this place featured on New Day Cleveland. Decided to come try it out. The service was amazing. Ordered the deluxe pizza and calamari it was awesome. Ended the meal with tiramisu. Definitely coming back here again.","Ordered for the first time from here. We ordered the pepperoni large and a Barro's combo and wings medium. Loved the pepperoni, loved the wings but the combo pizza was raw :( I think they need to cook the combo pizzas a little longer? Shame because the pepperoni was pretty great.","I don't think there's anything special about Cenci's, I'm sorry to say. Groupon brought me here twice during the last few months, but a meal here is not a mistake I'm willing to make a third time. . I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks that even below-average pizza is good/decent pizza, or at least I had that mindset before I came to Cenci's. The pizza here is pretty awful--commercial spongy crust, presumably inexpensive and greasy cheese, you get the idea. And it's not even that cheap, particularly if you want to get a little creative and add toppings or do the build-your-own thing. Unfortunately I had pizza both times I came here because I wanted to give the pizza a second try and the rest of the average bar food menu didn't exactly call my name. . Service during my experiences was OK, as were the White Russians. The place hasn't much personality, and the clientele is diverse.","Knocked off a star because of the service. . It's not that the bartenders and servers are bad - they're all lovely - it's that whomever is scheduling them is horrific at their job . Constantly understaffed. If you're running specials everynight and draw a moderate to full crowd, you need more than one person. The staff is apologetic about it and it's not enough to keep me away but holy crap man, take some burden off your employees for god's sake. Last four times I have been the wait times for service have been on the absurd side, you're doing nobody a favor here. . ------. Cannot believe I've waited so long to go here, kicking myself for wasting time with the smaller pizzerias (no offense). . Went on a Sunday, great specials on the pizza. I think it was 13 dollars for an XL pizza and you get four toppings for free. The pizza was delicious, went with spinach, feta two times, and ricotta, nice greek pizza. Got a side of fries which were quite tasty and fairly priced, big portion too. . GREAT beer selection, server knew her stuff and suggested a peanut butter porter which was phenomenal. . Cool place too, lots of TVs and seating. They have good specials every night on food and booze, will definitely be making Sunday nights pizza night now.","Best advice is to avoid Italian (fake) places in Vegas. We ordered marsala, baked ziti, linguine bolognese, bruschetta pizza. . . . and it all tasted like food you might barf up after a drunk night on the strip. . . Well, that is, after you washed it off in the sink. . I'm serious. It tastes like you washed it with water. And in the $20 price range. . where you could make this all at home with no experience for $1-2, they are sheistering you big time. . We were a group of four, and our server was hesitant to give us seconds on the bread rolls. . . which by the way I recognized as frozen Pillsbury dough boy dinner rolls  covered in butter and garlic powder salt (not even real butter). . it tasted chemical-ly. . Another in our group recognized some of the flavors as Stouffer's frozen food. . . This review is written by native Los Angelinos New Yorkers and Europeans. . . maybe our expectations are too high. . You'd have better luck eating next door at Grand Luxe Cafe. I guarantee your food will be better there, even though that's a chain. After all, this is a fake boutique Italian restaurant in an indoor shopping mall.","This is the worst papa johns establishment you could ever order from. They always have some kind of issue and cant their stuff straight. I even started doing carry out orders because there is always some kind of issue with delivery. If you think this will save you hassle I promise you that all you have is an even bigger headache. more then once when I did carry out they told me it was not ready and would let me know when it was done. seeing pizzas on the shelf I question in my mind if its mine","When 1st getting this vegan pizza the soho I didn't know what to expect. But I was pleasantly surprised. It's about the same as evel pie in flavor. I like that they have a specialty pizza that vegan I got mine w extra cheese. This location is not as busy as where evel pie is but they both have equally good vegan pizza. Negative one star only because this place is also hard to get to. If your getting take out you have to either pay for parking, or drive up the parking garage it's free for the 1st hour, but I had to go all the way up to the 2nd to last level around and around and around. I was thinking ugh. . this is so ridiculous. . . again. The should make it easier to get take out, like they should advertise if you show the valet the receipt they will let you park for 10 mins or so so you can run in get it then go home.  or somehow make it a easier process to get take out. Either way this place is a good place to get vegan pizza eat in or take out. It's inside a casino. To your right after you exit the parking garage elevators in the casino level.","The pizza is amazing and the wings are super crispy. . The place is impeccable and  the owner is super nice, if anybody had any problems with the service he would make it right. Again I wish this place was closer to my home.","We were on our way to get sushi and didn't realize the place was closed on Sunday so we ended up here instead. The place resembles a fast food joint more than a restaurant but it has full service. Decent food but I'd probably not come here again. . I think this is a place everybody should try at least once. If you're adventurous and want to try exotic foods you've never tried before, you need to come here. They have some Turkish entrees that I haven't seen elsewhere. When people think middle eastern food, it's usually falafel and shawarma. Yes they have those here too but if you come here, you really need to order their specialties like Pide or their Turkish entree dishes like fish and meat saute. . We ordered Meat Saute with lamb and Sheperd's Braised Chicken. Both came with salad and a basket of bread. For $15 an entree, I think it's reasonable but I'd prefer it to be cheaper and without the salad. I'm the kind of guy that likes to keep my orders around $10 outside of special occasions. They both tasted pretty good but not mind-blowing. They were not \"WOW I need to come again\" kind of goodness. The braised chicken had tastes similar to Chinese stir fry. The meat saute also tasted similar to stir fry. . The bread was awesome. It tasted like it came fresh from the oven. Too bad we had to ask for it. Our server seemed nice but he almost forgot our bread. The bread made us happier than the entrees. . Don't get me wrong. It's a decent restaurant but it fails my value test. If they chopped $2-3 off most of their entrees I'd consider coming again. If you want Pide pizza there are other options in the GTA for better prices. Besides, this place is in the middle of nowhere. There just isn't enough reason for me to drag myself all the way here for food that I feel is slightly overpriced.","We had a large pepperoni pizza and it was great. Homemade ranch dressing was so good. Good service.","Big fan!  The pizza is great and tasty and the garlic knots are excellent. Delivery service is also timely and professional.","I am impressed. . Continental breakfast was ok but wanted to try the real food which was Italian food and and their pizza. Thin bubbly crust pizza with good toppings and I wasn't left surprised in a bad way. . Ordered the recommended grilled calamari 4 stars yummy! . Grilled and topped with salad greens in a balsamic reduction and fresh ground pepper.  . House salad was very good too!  Fresh salad greens and more of that yummy dressing but not a reduction like the aforementioned dish.  4 stars too. . I could have order two of them and be happy.  . Pizza was the sausage and jalape\u00f1o pepper with red sauce.  $15 well worth the price.  . Add a few brew and tea and I'm ready for a nap now.  . I will be back.  . This location over the years has had challenges, but I thin this is the right spot for it.  . Yeah, I'll be here first thing in the morning again because it's attached to the Best Western Inn. But their regular food is where they really shine. Good service too!","This place has very good food but one of their policies is absolutely horrible. . They have Pizza at $5. 99 for a large one topping but the only problem is if you ask for a thin crust it cost you additional four dollars for the same exact pizza with a thin crust. . This is the type of situation that will alienate customers and have them not come back, I'm going to discuss it with family and we may never come back.","We went to Anejo for a late-night dinner and drinks. Being from Los Angeles I know a fair bit about Mexican food and Tequila, so we were really excited. . The tequila selection was definitely decent - I'd like to try a flight sometime, but I was really hoping to be \"sold\" on the idea by my waiter, who never mentioned it. We settled on margaritas, my boyfriend had an original and I had a Mango. I felt the margaritas were decent but wished they weren't so sweet. I asked for salt on my rim instead of sugar which helped. I will say, that both my bf and I make homemade margaritas all the time with freshly squeezed lime juice so we are spoiled. I really wish that a restaurant that is a \"tequila bar\" would serve a real margarita with lime juice instead of sweet mix, or so much agave. . Second, the food. We ordered the Queso Fundido, which I thought tasted like pizza in a bowl. Was delicious, but hard to eat - my suggestion is for them to add another type of softer cheese to this to provide a more dip like texture which would be easier to eat on a chip. I ordered the Short Rib Tacos (3), which were underwhelming - where's the flavor guys - the meat was bland, and the condiments boring. Also, the salsas they served in the little glass bowls were really bland and I missed a real pico de gallo or a table salsa to dip the chips in. Next time I guess we will try the guacamole. . My boyfriend had the Mole Chicken which he thought was okay, however it lacked the depth of flavor that we would have liked. The complexity and layers of flavor of a real mole are something we were looking forward to and this was just, basically a standard sauce without much gusto. . For dessert - we had the molten chocolate cake with tequila berries which I thought was delicious and memorable. . I feel that the ambiance at Anejo is cute, they are lacking in the food and drink department however which is what will bring their customers back once the \"newness\" of the establishment wears off. Also for the same price we could dine in a really amazing restaurant like Ox and Angela, or Una or somewhere that I find the food and atmosphere to be first rate.","Pure pizza heaven!  I love my pizza and this place makes some great pizza. My fav was double sauce with olive. I ate the whole thing myself. Brick oven crust is fantastic - chewy, crispy and extremely tasty.","I'm giving it one star because of location but this place is beyond run down. Our 2 room \"suite\" was circa 1990. Stained carpets, old beat up furniture, corroded bathroom fixtures, outlets ripped out of the wall, clogged up sinks, and duck tapped stained carpets in the hallways. Nasty. If you can't afford to update your rooms then you are certainly pretty tight in your casino payout also- and all they did was take take take from our group. $4 for a soda or a coffee. $5 slice of pizza. 1 bag of chips and a Gatorade $10. Miserable cocktail waitresses. . . I could go on and on about this strip hotel. I left my \"rewards\" card on the nightstand when checking out. I will not be back. Ever.","Had to get that breakfast pizza on a Steelers game Sunday! The meat option is topped with a nicely spicy sausage, bacon, and ham--yum! Cheddar cheese just like you'd get in your omelette, no sauce so you'll have to order the bloody Mary to get your tomato flavor fix. Be prepared for a pretty salty spicy cocktail, though. My friend got the mango mimosa and said it was tasty!","Amazing pizza! Good pasta too. I had delivery so I cannot comment on the environment or the service of this place. Br definitely will visit","I love this place! Compares to Barros but better and cheaper! Me, my hubby, and our kids all love the pizza and wings here. The wings are meaty and definitely better than Buffalo Wild Wings. To feed a family of 4 when 3 out of 4 are men/ boys you can't beat it! Screw the pizza huts and papa johns chain pizza joints and check this place out. Delivery is fast and they are always nice. Our delivery place since we first tried it and from now on.","Extremely upset with the fact that I submitted an order, and 20 minutes later I get a call saying the order wasn't submitted in time before closing? If these people don't want to work they should shorten their business hours. 2 weeks &amp; I haven't received my refund. I ordered before the pizza is bad. But the wings and garlic fries are good!","This place has amazing everything!! The garlic bread the broasted chicken The pepperoni  pizza!!! It's alllllll delicious and the staff is amazing. We received great customer service and we will definitely be back!!!!","Had a late lunch there with 3 of my friends. First off, our waiter Alex was very pleasant and entertaining. One of the best experiences I've had. He was great!  Second, the meatballs were by far the best I've had. Also shared a pizza. . . Yum! I will definitely be back and ask to be seated in Alex's section. . .","This must be a new place as we just discover it after seeing a move across the street. Absolutely an amazing pizza and wings. I ordered a six pc of wings mild, very good, my wife had small salad, very fresh and delicious. We ordered the white pizza, was wonderful, first time trying this kind of pizza. We also brought a Calzone and spaghetti home for the kids and they love it. . Price wise very reasonable, clean and FAST service. The owner came to our table couple of times and i would give them an A++ to take interest in their business. We always support family owned business anywhere we go. . To finish our dinner we shared strawberry cheese cake, was a bit small, however very good. overall very good place to eat extremely well prices for what you get.","I have been ordering from this Pizza Hut for years and the past few orders I have not been very impressed at all. The pizza had absolutely no mariner sauce on the pizza, I pulled the cheese back and all I see is the bread with very little red here and there. It didn't even cover the whole area. Then the mariner sauce for the cheese was so runny that I have to imagine they mix water with it. The service has always been good, the delivery people have been good as well.","Ordered delivery, only reason for the second star. Delivery was fast and prompt. However the pizza was horrible. The pizza was soggy &amp; cheese tasted like it was cheap. Never buying again!","Clean shop. The cashier is efficient. I ordered my pizza slice to-go. It got cold very quickly unfortunately. I ate it less than two minutes after leaving the establishment. It tasted good, but I was a bit bummed because it would have been a lot better warmer.","This place was awesome! Super cool ambiance, food &amp; service. There was 4 of us and we had the calamari to start which was awesome. Here in the states they put so much breading on calamari - but BEVO did it perfectly where you actually got to taste the calamari. We ordered tortellini, lasagna, gnocchi &amp; pizza &amp; all were delicious! Definitely recommend this place.","Amazing place, super cool ambience. . Was here on a Saturday night. I guess I was the last customer. Also, they even had a pizza oven shut. Guy at the counter was kind enough to take my order for a salad and an appetizer. . Ordered -. Caprese Salad : tasted really delicious with the wine from Garage East. Mozzarella cheese was really fresh and yum. . Hummus Plate: tasted good. Liked the topping on hummus though, pita bread was fresh and totally made my evening. . I highly recommend this place. Service was quick and best of all its a patio seating with soothing live music.","Ordered  pizza for pick up because I was in a hurry. They didn't start making it till after I got there. Even after they confirmed I was on my way while I was on my way. He gave me some free soda so I gave him 2 extra stars.","Wow was I surprised. Delicious pizza at a delicious price. Pizza was a good size and filled me right up. When I walked in, everyone was all smiles. I highly recommend the Margherita pizza, tasted authentic and had me craving more, so I ordered an extra slice to take home. Highly recommend!","They do a mix between standard New York style and Neapolitan without really being exactly either. Quality product, pizzas are very good. Beer selection is excellent. Fennel and arugula salad adding the chicken is excellent. Expect prices to be higher than normal as is standard inside casinos.","Quite good for a non-gourmet pizza place, always satisfied. 100% better than Pizza Pizza a few doors down. . .","This place definitely lives up to its eponymous hype. I booked a early reservation for a Monday night, and had the entire place to ourselves. Walking up the steps across its golden stairs really heightened the grand entrance feeling. I highly recommend sitting by the bar area, as it lets you watch the prep work and food being cooked. . Our server Evan was very helpful and friendly with his service, recommending various food items and which cocktails to try, and attended to every single aspect of our dining experience. The service alone earns a solid 5-stars. . The wagyu tacos and bluefin tuna pizza are definitely 100% must-trys. While the meat itself is not as great as the name might imply, they were solid tacos with a great mix of hardshell and tangy sauced mince beef. The pizza however was absolutely delicious. The tuna is flown in every night, and the fish is comparable in freshness as what you might find in a restaurant in Japan. . Their special sushi rolls are a terrific option too. While their tapas portions are smaller, I recommend ordering a few rolls to fill yourself. . The sea urchin tempura tasted fresh, though I still prefer the raw sushi version. . All in all, while this place errs on the more expensive side, it is worth a first trip, and many trips after that.","I already loved Joe's but recently I accidentally ordered what I thought was a portobello mushroom sandwich, but it was actually a burger. (I'm a vegetarian) They switched out the meal for a veggie pizza with no fuss. Thanks Joe's!","Another stop in our quest for acceptable pizza, Slice at the ballpark was just fine on a Monday night. We had a margherita and a Frisky Billygoat. The pizzas were tasty, the people were nice. The Pirates were not playing that evening, so I can't speak to what the atmosphere might be during a game. I am sure we will be back; This is really a 3. 5 star review.","I love coming to sushi ichiban for their all-u-can-eat sushi special! At first, I was a bit suspect based on what others have told me and having eaten at places in chicago, but I was pleasantly surprised! They have a large variety of sushi from spider rolls to something called a spicy tuna pizza, which is a rice patty tempura with spice tuna and spicy mayo on top. They should really add to the appetizer portion of the all-u-can-eat menu though. The only thing that really irks me about this place is that they raised the prices by like $8 within a year! WHO DOES THAT!??! Thank the lord my friends have coupons so we were able to still get the deal for a decent price. Overall, the all-u-can-eat deal is good, but only if you have those coups, lol.","Flamingo is one of those older gems on the strip. The casino is nice and the good court has some good options, the pizza from both pizza places is yumzo :) . Stayed here with free rooms from a certificate and I thought it was just fine. . . . The room size is good for Vegas and yeah it could be a little dirty here and there but nothing major. Our room was actually pretty clean. Check in was a B, the line was long but it was moving, we checked in around 11pm. . Like pretty much every casino, the servers are nice and tentative :). The cleaning ladies did a great job keeping our room nice and provided new towels and hand towels every visit. . . . Why I can't really complain it because the location is so central on the strip that you don't have to walk for hours . I would like to check out one of the shows","This pizza is the best I have ever eaten. My girlfriend said the same thing.","Can't believe I just made it here last week! Went in for lunch on a Friday and first I want to say the woman who took our order was a gem. She was so nice and remembered my name throughout our whole visit. The pizza was actually better than I was expecting. I'm always a bit iffy when places claim to serve neopolitan style pizza. But it was great! The dough honestly knocked my socks off and it came out very quickly. . OH and they serve Leonas!","So I had the pleasure of visiting this place two days in a row- that's how good it was &amp; how much I Loved it! The first night my waitress was amazing and recommended the Fish Tacos, by far the best I ever had! Made me want to go again, so of course I did the next day. . . lol- that night I sat at bar, since there' was room, had a pizza with fig reduction, mozzarella, arugula &amp; balsamic reduction sauce!  it was good. Paired with a Blueberry Ale- service is great, atmosphere is on point and the menu can keep you intrigued for many visits, but don't believe me, just go order the Fish Tacos!","I am probably rating Sainatos a bit higher than I should based purely on the quality of the food and service, but they are a dearly beloved hold-out -- an independently owned pizza place that isn't trying too hard and, most importantly, actually delivers!. The pizza is good, and arrives hot. The meatballs are super tasty, especially atop their cheesy garlic bread. Stay strong, Sainatos!  Never change!","Great pizza. Staff is friendly. We were looking for a thin crust pizza with great taste and fresh ingredients. Beach Pizza has it all. The crust is crispy, the sauce is flavorful and the veggies are fresh. Prices are good and it is a gem.","I am guessing Shore survives because they have a diverse menu. Not many spots serve, fajitas, pastas, pizzas and catch of the day all, at reasonable prices. Sadly that is the extent of my praise. Spinach salad to start was fresh and tasty enough to warrant 3 stars. Mushroom bruschetta was a soggy 1. 5 star mess. Veal Marcella was a gravy laden, shoe leather mess.","Excellent pizza, premium ingredients. If the Michelin Guide reviewed pies, Crisp is the one for Scottsdale.","The pizza is delicious!!! I especially love the crust and the fact that they don't charge extra after 3 toppings :)","after ordering two soups and a small cheese pizza and spending 35 dollars my order arrives and I get soup and an everything pizza ? I call and tell them they sent the wrong order they apologize and say they will send the correct order right now do after an hour I call and they say that the phone person that took my order left for the night and forgot to put the order in. . . then got a little nasty as I was up set them sent another pizza 30 minuteslater. . . 3 hrs for a pizza and the soup was very salty to the point that I wished I opened a can of soup . . . go else we're","I came here with some girlfriends and I'm very pleased that we chose Novanta. I have since been back with my husband and young son. . The pizzas are great! I have sampled several of the pizzas, a couple of the mozzarella bar selections and the cannoli. The pizza and mozzarella bar items have all been outstanding! Each. And. Every. One. Seriously good stuff!!!. I didn't like the cannolis but I have to preface that with the fact that I have never really enjoyed cannolis. However, my friends who are cannoli fanatics deemed Novanta's cannolis delicious. . Parking during busy times (especially lunch) can be a bit of a pain but the pizza and mozzarella bar (and I suppose the cannolis if you are into that kind of thing lol) are totally worth driving around and stalking people for their spot as they leave!","We love ordering pizza from here!! It's fun to call ahead and take it home . We have ordered pizza for birthday parties and everyone loved it . The guys that work here are always so nice . It makes me feel like I'm in New York eating pizza!!","Horrible service from the waitress. I had to ask for water after 10 minutes. She seemed like she's never waitressed before. The ingredients were substandard and the prices were very high. I'm actually shocked that this place has a few 5 star ratings, very weird. Will not be coming back. Wish you guys the best. Maybe you should sell pizzas sandwiches and salads.","Food was okay, way greasy!  We ordered a special pizza, asked them to take off hot peppers and add bell peppers, they charged us a 1. 00? Really? We had to pour our own water, and our waitress ignored us the entire time. I had to ask a bus boy for a to go box, and had to ask another one to tell our waitress we needed our check. She forgot to put our appetizer in, so it came after our pizzas and she charged us for it anyway. We will not go back. And it was 48. 60 for 2 pizzas and an order of cheese bread-  not worth it.","I first ventured to La Tavola after it was recommended by a co-worker when I had a summer internship in Pittsburgh. I was a bit skeptical at first because one of the first things I noticed was that each table had a fairly prominent table number placed in it (much like they have at weddings and such). This wasn't something I expected from a first class establishment, nor was I expecting the bread to be served in plastic baskets. However these were both moot points as the service and food were both as good as it gets. I have been back many times over the years and though I no longer live or work in the city, I make a point to eat at La Tavola each time I visit Pittsburgh. I have brought many friends and relatives to La Tavola and they all have nothing but great things to say. . My cliff notes:. -Calamari diavlo (sp?), amazing appetizer that isn't on the menu but is offered every night as far as I know. I order it every time and am never disappointed. . -Byob. Not sure what the corkage is but it rounds to zero. Enough said. . -The staff knows the menu inside out as well as any specials being offered. Most if the servers I have had are clearly there fir the long term and have a vested interest in providing the best service possible. -Carmella owns the restaurant along with her husband. They also are the chefs. Very sweet people who care about their patrons, food, and having a good time. -very accommodating to large groups. I've gone with just my girlfriend or with a group of 14. Food is always fantastic and I never har problems making reservations the day of, granted the day I went with 13 other friends was a weds. -sometimes when they are very busy the service can be a bit slow if you are with a large party. Make sure you brig good company and good wine. . -prices are very reasonable for food of the best quality. -the lack of reviews in no way is representative of the amount if business they get. There are usually a few large parties every time I go and everyone always seems to have a great time. -menu is not the easiest thing to read as most items are in Italian. Fortunately, the staff is always more than happy to explain anything and everything to you in as much detail as possible. -pizza is amazing. Best I've had in Pittsburgh hands down. They have a little \"shop\" attached to the restaurant for take out or delivery. Highly recommended","Bumping this up to 5 stars. My second time here is almost 2 years after Custom Built opened, woops!  That shows you how often I go to the west side. My friend Nicole B. 's birthday is Tuesday and she gets married next weekend, so I decided to chill with her while her husband-to-be had his bachelor party which included Eric R. 's presence. NIcole B. wanted pizza - she was interested in trying something new. I suggested Custom Built - she got the groupon and we walked around the North Premium Outlets for 3 hours in preparation for dinner!. When we arrived, there was no wait which was great because we were starving. I ordered the regular crust, spicy diavola sauce and a few dabs of pistachio pesto, ricotta, buffalo and shredded mozzarella. . . and then here comes the veggies!  Fresh tomatoes, artichokes, jalapenos, caramelized onions, eggplant. . . then I added chicken. They added a fried egg on top after cooking the pizza, then I asked for the toppings that are added after the pizza is cooked: fresh spinach, basil, green onions, cilantro, and sundried tomatoes. It was truly a work of art. It was cut into 8 slices this time rather than 4 like when I first got here. Nicole B. ordered the honey wheat crust for hers and she really liked it. I got a Mexican coke and we ordered the s'mores pizza. Since it was Nicole's birthday, it was \"on the house\"!  The staff here was SOOOOO nice!. When our pizzas came out hot and delicious, I was so excited. Mine held up. I do like the thicker crust because it allows for tons of toppings. At Project Pie the crust was thinner and fewer toppings were recommended because the crust got wet while cooking. This is not the case here. We polished off our entire pizzas (no easy feat, seriously) and then chatted for awhile before asking the staff to fire up our dessert. When it arrived, our mini pizza was delivered smelling amazing. It was smeared with nutella and marshmallows that had a nice brown color on top. It was heavenly. I really am impressed and am somewhat relieved this is on the other side of town or I may be eating here too often. Luckily, we still have a groupon so hopefully Eric R. and I will be back soon!  However, this was great for a girls night out!","This place is becoming one of my new favorite places for pizza. It is also vegan friendly, making life easier for me having a girlfriend who is vegan. She really enjoy's the vegan pizza and my favorite is the 5th street. Wish they would open another location, it is sometimes difficult to park ordering takeout. The Plaza needs to tell the valets to lighten up","Unbelievably great service all smiles when you walk in call you by name, they take your pizza out and open the door not to mention great pizza. Super super fast service. In a Time when service is lacking this is so uncommonly good. Thank you.","Best pizza in Plum in my opinion, and they deliver ALL of Plum. Good quality ingredients, and they don't skimp on anything.","Came to Beach Pizza tonight for a fundraiser. We actually live by the M Resort so I was really hoping the drive was worth it. We were greeted right away and the staff were polite and friendly (not sure why so many negative reviews about the staff. They were nothing but polite to us) We even opted to eat outside because the weather was so nice and she boxed up our order and brought us plates, napkins, silverware, cheese, etc. to the outdoor table without us asking. . Pizza isn't on my diet, so tonight was a splurge/cheat day. We go to a mom &amp; pop place out near us and we're pretty loyal to it. I just won't waste the calories in pizza if it comes from Pizza Hut or Papa Johns, you know?. I was really happy with our pizza selection. We got a half and half and a medium sized order of wings. The boyfriend loves wings that are more on the crunchy then the chewy side - and these were, so he was a happy camper. . I love a good vegetarian pizza (even though I'm not a vegetarian) and this one was great. Sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, lots of cheese, artichoke hearts and fresh garlic. The other half of our pizza was their version of a supreme pizza. (Photo is loaded in the photos section) I've gotta say - I'm pretty picky. The crust on this pizza was better then at my regular pizza place. So all in all, I was totally thrilled, I've told my friends, and I WILL be back.","5 stars and I've only tried the gelato once. I like their style. Propeller coffee, openable front window and spacious interior with a wacky front entrance where you can do a catwalk into the place without even entering, neat! The menu looked good for brunch and they have some cute little booths along the back opposite the windowed kitchen in the rear and opposite the gelato counter. Why go to Starbucks when you can get your caffeine fix at this cool spot just a few doors down? They have an awesome staff with some talented cooks in the back whipping up some creative gelato. . The newest thing is a partnership with Pizza Thick from the east end. Last time I was there the pizza was being whipped up and sounded impressive. And this is what Alex park needs! More pizza. Sure we have Maker pizza now, but they don't do slices. Why? Who knows, but DVG can help, and there's no doubt there.","Don't have the slightest concern this place can not be seen from the street (unless you have X-ray vision like superman). It's well worth the stop!  Very good pizza: fresh, fine ingredients, made with care. And, the Caesar crisp/cold. . . . . . . . . . . and they make their own dressing need I say more? Priced well!  Comfortable atmosphere. . . Family business we should support. Jimi says check it out!","The food is absolutely delicious! I am a huge fan of the garlic shrimp pizza. For the appetizer I loved the chicken quesadilla which I happily took leftovers home. Most of the reviews complain about customer service, but from what I noted and saw you need to get your lazy butt up to ask. As we had zero problems getting items and refills as needed. It has a comfort home vibe, but steered to all age groups. I am sure the older generations are use to be waited on, but that doesn't seem to be how this place functions. Definitely recommend giving it a shot before quick judgment and observe how the place works as it is more cafe style like hanging out at a coffee shop or bar.","Had a great time here. Sat at the bar. Great pizza and reasonable for a Vegas Hotel.   . Place has nice energy, and well trained staff. Our pizzas were very good, and other food looked great as well.   . Will definitely be back","I've been a regular enough patron at Sambuca for a number of years. It's been a great place to have a good meal. Sadly, things have changed. My last visit I ordered a pizza from the daily special and asked for no onions. I was assured it wouldn't be a problem. After a considerable wait I was served a pizza with onions on it. I told the waiter and he carried it off to the kitchen. To my dismay, he returned immediately and placed it on the table in front of me. I was told the chef said there were no onions. However, after he must have removed some, there were others still clearly visible. I was floored by the way I was treated. Had to order something else. No serious apology. . . It will be the last time I visited the place.","Went to try the SLS buffet tonight. This buffet is notch under the other premium buffets on the strip. Cost for Friday nights buffet dinner was 39. 99. They had the usual split crab legs, Peel and eat shrimp that were actually pretty good. They had a small but good selection of dim sum. Their small selection of sushi was actually pretty good. they had selections of oysters and clams, ribeye steak and Peking chicken. Service at the buffet was very good. They also had a small selection of Indian fair. Pastas and fire oven pizzas. All in all we were satisfied with the food and quality. The dessert bar was very tasty. The selections for the dessert bar included made to order crapes and very tasty gelatos. Again this is not a buffet at Caesars or Bellagio, but it was fun to try a new different buffet. Atmosphere at this buffet was very quiet. Making the dining experience very enjoyable. It seems like a lot of locals go here because of the promotions that they have.","Great pies! We just had a guys trip down to Scottsdale and I think we ate here a least 2 or 3 times. The pies are delicious!! They keep it simple and use really good quality ingredients! . i am personally a huge anything PESTO fan, so I ordered the grilled chicken Pesto and it was great! Among the group, I think, we ended up ordering like 5 pizza before heading out to the bars!  Another memorable one was the roasted mushroom. . The pizza place was a 7/serious pie(seattle)!!  Would recommedn!","I love the this place. Affordable prosecco. Delicious pizzas and pasta (and they have a nutella pizza). Gorgeous bar. Each time I went, the staff was really nice.","The pizza here is great, delicious and a good price. Sometimes the service lacks because it is also a bar (which I also enjoy) but when you come for dinner or the happy hour pizza you have to wait longer than expected.","Most recently I went to Cibo on a Friday night. The hostesses seemed a bit disorganized. We had to wait about 20 mins -30 mins for a table for 3, so we had a drink at bar. The bartender was helpful and attentive. . When we got seated upstairs there were a good amount of empty tables so that was a bit strange. Our server was friendly and got our bottle of wine from the bar sent up as the hostess said she couldn't bring it up with us. The atmosphere upstairs was nice, open and its perfect for a get together with friends. . The menu has many great Italian options we ordered the arancini, garganelli pasta and mushroom pizza. The server came back within 5 mins to tell us that they ran out of pizza dough!! We were super disappointed with that. So we ordered the cod and tuna instead. . When the arancini came out the runner plopped it on the table said \"meatballs\" and walked away lol. They tasted delicious (best in the city) and they were not meatballs. The garganelli pasta came out great, I would definitely order it again, my friends were happy with the tuna and cod as well. . For dessert we had the Dark Chocolate torta which was good. It wasn't too sweet which I liked but I would probably go for something else next time. It didn't wow me, we didn't even finish it (unusual for dessert). . The wine and conversation flowed all night. . . If it wasn't for the mediocre service and the fact that they ran out of pizza dough on a Friday night (Big thumbs down!). I would really rate Cibo higher than a 3 star. I've had good experiences here in the past and I really like their enclosed patio in the summer and happy hour specials.","Ordered take out from here, and it was absolute garbage. The pizza looked like it was slopped together and they skimped on the toppings. Terrible attempt at Neapolitan pizza. Save the headache and check out Queen Margarita or Pizza Libretto instead.","The deep dish pizza is pretty good,  despite the reviews I guess it's one of those places that you have to try you either like it or you don't but in my opinion it was pretty good.","My husband and I love their pizza! We've ordered delivery from them twice and are very pleased with both the service and prompt delivery of fresh hot delicious pizza. We are impressed with their pizza as it's flavorful yet a fresh light taste. . . Not to mention the scrumptious crust! Addictive! It's very surprising to see the low ratings by others. We've only tried their pizza so we suggest you give it a shot! Try their classic Margarita pizza made well done. You won't regret it!","The pizza is good enough service is fast but nothing spectacular. I drove over here from the suburbs because I was in the mood for delicious pizza I was a bit disappointed. It's definitely not the best pizza I've ever had but it's pretty good pizza for the price although the price has gone up from 350 to 375 per slice. The calzone was really good and flavorful but the regular slice was so so. The garlic oil on top was delicious!","Mark Rich's is near home and has great delivery service. . . usually arrives in 30-45 mins. I absolutely LOVE the Stromboli!  We had spaghetti with meatballs and shells and cheese and both were very good. The salads are large, but nothing special as far as taste goes. We also had pepperoni pizza with jalapenos. . . which are VERY spicey, not a bad thing if you like them that way but be warned.","Mama Gina might know best, but isn't giving her BEST these days. . It was Valentine's Day afternoon and we opted to divert our stomachs to Mama Gina's Pizzeria to avoid the 30-45 minute wait at another popular restaurant in the same center. . This restaurant has so much potential to bring in lots of business with its high visibility and prime corner location at Westgate Entertainment District.  . Mama Gina's advertises itself as 'specializing in hospitality and pizza'. I agree with their latter claim, as their pizza was actually the one thing that saved this place from my giving them a lower rating. . Upon checking in on Yelp, I noticed the \"$1 for 20oz Fountain Drink\" offer and asked our server if I could redeem it. She appeared bothered and said she'd HAVE to ask. Seriously?!!  $1 won't even put a dent in our bill for a table of 7. . We had the New York style Mama's Supreme with sausage, pepperoni, green peppers, onions, mushrooms, and mozzarella cheese, which was quite good. Loved the crust. . The Side House Salad, on the other hand, tasted like cafeteria salad with Blue Cheese dressing, mixed with watered down mayo(?). I prefer pungent chunks of real blue cheese in my blue cheese dressing. . We shared a few dishes amongst our group of 7. . - Meat stuffed Ravioli with extra meatballs:  The pasta texture was a little on the doughy side, the meatballs not beefy enough in taste, and marinara sauce was mediocre at best. . - Baked Ziti: Similar taste to their Ravioli, except the pasta itself was better prepared. . - Mama's Antipasto Salad:  Mixed greens topped with sun-dried tomatoes, roasted peppers, artichoke hearts, red onion, olives with balsamic vinaigrette dressing. It was good, but not as fresh as I'd expected. . Drinks were served in flimsy 20 oz plastic cups, left empty too long at times. Our server seemed perturbed again, when we asked for refills. She must have forgotten about us. So, we asked another server for refills, who must have whispered to our server that our cups had been empty for some time now. Our server's demeanor changed for the better, but seemed forced. She returned to our table with the scripted 'How is everything?' and 'Can I get anyone anything else?' . At the end of our meal, I was handed our bill. I stared down at our $100+ receipt for a little bit and read below the total:. ***Review us on \"Yelp\" and get 50% off your next visit!!! (excluding alcohol)***  . Three questions for the the owners or the Management.  1) Why would you risk including such a great offer on your receipt and not ensure that your staff puts out their BEST?  2) Will I still get 50% off our next visit, even if I give you a 2-star review?  3) Lastly, when is it appropriate to automatically add 18% gratuity? We had a group of 7 people and the place was not busy, probably 3/4 empty. I usually tip 20% everywhere, but your service was not even deserving of 18%. . We're only in town once a year, but even so, it's doubtful that we'll return to this restaurant to redeem our 50% off. . Advice:  Try to be your BEST at all times.","As far as I know there's only one of these in Las Vegas and that's way up North at a Truck Stop on the outskirts of Vegas. I made the drive as there's one of these back home and I needed to find the taco pizza. The only complaint I have is that they did not have sour cream for the taco pizza I even went into the truck stop to try and buy some but they did not sell it either.","Pizza was very good. i had the 9-11 wings and they were incredibly flavorful. we got a free funnel cakes because of a check in offer they had with yelp so that was cool. they hadnt renewed their liqour license so there was no alchohol available. after we left my wife told me she had found a hair on her slice of pizza. unfortunate. ill prob be back to try the hotwing challenge. def 4 star worthy if it wasnt for the hair.","I was so excited to get Chicago style deep dish. I was not let down! The pizza was great!!! They had green olives! We have looked all over town for a pizza place, any pizza with green olives. To then get them on a fantastic deep dish pizza was such a treat! Anthony, the waiter was very nice and the perfect amount of attentive. All this at a very reasonable price. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I think the crust could be a touch better. A little butter on the crust world make it perfect. We will definitely go again.","We came here on a weekend sampling their dinner and happy hour meals. . Happy hour pizza, salami, and moscow mules were fantastic. . From the dinner menu, we ordered chicken parmesan with angel hair and another seafood pasta dish with angel hair. Both dishes were very tasty.  . We would definitely come back next time to try more dishes.","By far the best pizza I tried in montreal and I would recommend it for everyone but beware. . . the owner is one of these cranky guys that doesn't smile to anything . . not even to kittens and puppies. Stay away from him","Stopped in today for lunch with my family to check out the \"local\" restaurant in Vistancia. My girls shared a plate of ziti with marinara and my husband and I both ordered pepperoni and cheese calzones and an order of mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks were \"okay\" they were a little on the done side. My girls loved the pasta and the calzone was tasty. I will say I have never had a calzone with ricotta cheese in it before. The verdict is still out on whether I would get it again, but we will probably be back to try the pizza once we move.","Omg I order a lot of pizzas, but tonight was by far the best one in ah long while. Toppings were spot on, piping hot, speedy delivery, an pleasant service. . . Thanks Dominos","I ate at L'Atelier on opening day, and another four times since then. While the excitement of going to a great new restaurant is gone, the quality remains. L'Atelier isn't cheap, but it serves the best food of any restaurant in its price range. If you like innovative food that tastes great, you owe it to yourself to try this place. . The best way to sample what L'Atelier has to offer is to get the tasting menu. It varies a little over time, but remains recognizable. Here are notes from my 1st meal (I took better notes then):. * Vegetable Fondant Topped With a Delicate Avocado Cream. A small martini glass with a layer of tomato gelee, soft yet firm, smooth, bright red, with an intense tomato flavor. On top, thick avocado cream/puree, bright green and delicious. Take a spoon and get a bit of both layers; it looks beautiful on the spoon and tastes just as good. . . * La Langoustine Carpaccio With Roasted Poppy Seed Dressing. A rectangle, paper thin, with micro chives, pepper, and lemon oil. It's a tiny portion but with strong flavor and a soft, melting texture. . * Les Huitres: Poached Baby Kumamoto Oysters With French Echre [sp?] Salted Butter. Three tiny oysters with salty butter on top, with black pepper; warmed briefly. I don't like oysters, but these were terrific! Perhaps I've been eating oysters in the wrong places. . * L'Oeuf: Egg Cocotte Topped With a Light Mushroom Cream. Another dish served in a martini glass. In the bottom, some bright green parsley puree. Next a raw egg. The glass is then steamed, cooking the egg white but not the yolk. On top, a frothy, flavorful cream of mushroom soup, with a couple of pieces of chanterelle mushroom on top of that. Another wonderful combination of flavors; another case where I wasn't so sure I'd like it, but did. . * Le Foie Gras: Rich, soft but slightly brown on the outside. I loved it. . * Le Morue: Fresh Cod Filet in Vegetable Broth. The broth had a drop of basil oil, giving it an interesting flavor. The cod was barely cooked through, wrapped in a very thin piece of ravioli. Excellent!. * An extra treat, compliments of the chef: a papillote of langoustine. This was a generous piece of langoustine wrapped in a thin layer of phyllo dough, and quickly fried. . * La Caille: Free-range Quail Stuffed With Foie Gras, With Truffled Potato Puree. Two small pieces of quail, good flavor, firm but not dry. Now about the potato puree - potatoes can't be this good! They take raw potatoes, and rub them against a fine sieve. They're pureed with lots and lots of butter, and some snippets of chive are added. All of this is covered with a layer of thin truffle slices. Incredible! [note: the next time I went, they used much less truffle, but it was still excellent]. . * La Framboise: Raspberry Jelly Madam Yuzu and Citrus Cream. The jelly was not too sweet, not too thick, with very intense flavor. The citrus cream was thick and delicious. There were several very large, ripe seedless raspberries. . * Le Chocolat: Chocolate Sensation Cremeux Araguai, Oreo Cookie Crumbs. \" Yes, a second dessert; my kind of place. This was a tiny portion that is in the running for my favorite dessert ever. At the bottom was (I think) a bit of bitter, thick caramel. Above that, thick, very dark Valrhona chocolate. Above that (or to the side) was something like a ball of ice cream - I can't describe it very well, but it was delicious. Finally, some finely crumbled Oreo cookie, and a thin piece of chocolate in the form of a ring, forming a cover with a hole in the middle. [sad note: this dessert has gone downhill over time. There is no longer any caramel, and the chocolate layer is more like a regular chocolate mouse. ] Rating of VG - very good, but nothing like the dessert last time. . * The meal ended with a choice of cappuccino or espresso; I chose cappuccino. It was rich, not bitter, and came with rough cubes of brown sugar and white sugar. . Not a single course was merely good. Everything was beautifully presented. At almost any other restaurant, any of the courses I had at L'Atelier would have been a star of the entire meal. . I've also ordered a la carte, but space limitation prevent a full description. A couple of highlights:. * La Lisette: Fresh mackerel on a thin tart with Parmesan shavings and olives. Almost like a tiny, thin pizza. The flavors were strong; the very thin crust was very flaky. Simple food wonderfully prepared. . * Le Homard: Maine lobster salad with a sherry vinegar dressing. A very generous amount of sweet lobster, in a strongly flavored but not overpowering dressing, served on top of greens. Very simple, but expertly prepared. . **UPDATE October 2007: I tried the tasting menu yet again. It's changed a little, e. g. : halibut instead of cod; new desserts; a much smaller portion of potato puree. However, it's not that different, and the quality is as good as ever.","Spicy chicken strips were awesome and they have a homemade ranch i loved. Also got a pizza pie with everything. . real cheese! Crust was super crispy for having all those toppings","Horrible, went there on a Wednesday night when there was no one else but myself there and I ordered a personal pizza that was way over priced. They charged me for a 2 topping when I ordered a 1 topping, it took the guy 30 minutes to bring the tiny pizza. I said black olive only and they gave me black olive and pepperoni, when I told them I don't eat meat they took it back and picked off the pepperoni and added extra cheese to hide it but the cheese was not melted and it still had the grease from the pepperoni. . Oh and not to mention it took the guy ANOTHER 30 minutes to do that to my pizza. . When I saw this I asked for my money back and walked out never to return, awful!","DH was getting pizza at #1 Brothers---I didn't feel like Italian, but sushi. Since Electric Eel is in the same plaza, I thought it would be just easier to order take-out from them. Friday night I called three times, and the last two times let the phone ring at least 10 times. No answer. Out of business? Ended up ordering from dear old fave down the road. But when DH went to pick up his pizza, he said Electric Eel was open. So I don't know what food is like, but as far as customer service goes: FAIL.  I won't bother trying again when I can drive another 1/2 mile south and feel appreciated and get good sushi.","This place is my favorite place to get pizza in Las Vegas. My friends and I have been ordering from here for years! We will actually drive the 20 minutes from home to pick it up because it's that worth it. It's the best NY style pizza outside of NY and the Garlic Knots are to die for! It's a must if you're a local or staying at Red Rock Casino.","Having had to wait in a long line to get a table at Marcello's on previous visits, we decided on an early dinner and met at the restaurant at 6pm on Friday (which is early for us). We got one of the last available tables. Soon after we placed our order, there was a line at the door.  . This restaurant gets super busy, but it took very little time to receive our appetizers, followed by main courses. The pastas here are good (penne alla vodka, fettucine alfonza) and the pasta properly al dente, but we think the star is their pizzas. The thin crust and generous toppings (and flexibility in substituting toppings) made the pizza cheesy, full of flavour yet not too filling. . Prices are reasonable here (including their wine list), and service is prompt and professional. Tables turn over fairly quickly, but there seems to be a constant line-up once dinner hour begins, so plan accordingly!  However, as this is a family friendly restaurant, there are often strollers parked near the door obstructing those waiting for a table and those leaving after their meals.","the pizza was good but it was really thin, so if you are really hungry you may want to get more food with your pizza. the size is 8 slices which is good for 2 because is a thin pizza. the service was really good. The price for the pizza was 13. 50 too pricey for just a regular mazzorella cheese pizza. I left there feeling hungry.","I ordered delivery tonight and got a 16\" one topping, Alfredo pasta, a garden salad, and a 2 liter of soda. . First the pasta was AWFUL, there was no flavor. . at all. There was melted cheese on top and I couldn't even taste that. Alfredo is supposed to be creamy, yummy, and this was far from it. Ive literally had better from the grocery stores freezer section. The pasta itself was mushy, really mushy. The garlic bread tasted like oil, no garlic taste at all, no butter-y goodness, just oily and tough (like chewing beef jerky). The pizza was weird, like the crust was almost cardboard-y, the sauce had a strong sweet taste like they added to much sugar, its got a strong basil taste as well. The cheese had no flavor again, it was almost fake tasting. The sausage I got on it reminded me of ground beef thats how SMALL the chunks were. . The salad was even odd. For one they put it in the SAME bag as the pasta which means it was warm, and sweated. The tomatoes were slices (how much energy does it take to chop a freaking tomato) and the cucumbers were soggy. Lettuce as meh, but what got me is the ranch was gross. It tasted like a cole-slaw dressing mixed with ranch. Sweet and mayonnaise-y with an odd powdered ranch taste. . The soda was good though, perhaps its because they didn't make it. They took over an hour to deliver and they are less than a mile away. . Now the driver was awesome, nice guy, even thanked me for the tip which shows great customer service .","Good whole pizza. Macaroni salad taste a little bit like rubber crayons. Overall food is good.","Absolutely our favorite pizza. All fresh ingredients . Love the crust and sause. Wish I lived closer. Grinders are great too, but end up mostly with the pizza because I just can't pass up the pizza. Very friendly service. Try it, you'll like it!","Looks are deceiving. The pizza was great the hot peppers were nice and hot   The sausage was spicy and infused with a gentle fennel flavour. One of the better pizza joints I've been to.","15 dollars for two people food was not good salad was old piZza was cold pizza taste weird only thing good cinnamon rolls not worth ur money","Authentic Italian! I loved this place. Be warned on a hot and humid day is like sitting in a sauna. But a sauna that serves delicious fresh food and wine. . . . So it's all good. . For starters we shared the Platter. Meat cheese olive and a bit of bread. Tasty but over priced. We also had the olives. . . . Covered in oil rosemary and orange they were great. We had the crostini. The goat ragu was one of the nicest things I've ever had. Also highly rate the blue cheese and walnut one. Mmmm. . For mains I had the meatballs over polenta with a side of cauliflower. It was flavorful and creamy. The meatballs were succulent and well done. I tried  the pasta with peas and sausage. It was bursting with flavour and a generous portion. The sausage pizza was also tasty but nothing to write home to your mother about. . All topped off with San pellegrino and a bottle of Nero. 52$ each. Not a bad price. I would recommend and will likely return. Maybe when it is a bit Cooler out. Service was friendly. Not particularly special. Enjoyable overall and well priced. would be a nice date place, pretty small and cosy dining area.","Let's start out with the positive. . . cappuccino  was fabulous. Decided to order a date artichoke pizza due to another person's suggestion and a Caesar salad. The salad was $11 and super small, five less then green romaine leaves with honey mustard dressing and four pretzel croutons. I guess I don't know what Caesar means because it appeared to me as a small romain salad with delicious pretzel squares. The pizza was interesting just needed salt. Our waitress would only come if we waved her down and the place was not too busy. Overall food and exercise was fine. Glad we tried it, on to new restaurants here in Vegas.","Ok. . . so called this place at 6pm. . . just now got my flipping pizza!! Its now 8:15!!! The pizza isn't any thing that great either. . . crust boring. . . just very 'ok' pizza. . definitely not worth $21 &amp; a 2 hr wait!! Plus they forgot our side of ranch!!","Hop in Brew. . . oh Hop in Brew, how can I not love your little pub in a house? Upstairs and down, inside and out, it's easy to see why you're a favourite local hangout. . Almost as soon as I cross the threshold, I can't help but relax. Cozy clusters of tables throughout, a small bar at the back, and a laid-back attitude from the staff and other patrons make for an enjoyable spot to just kick back for awhile. . Your pizza makes my mouth water just thinking about it, so much so that I brought in a crew that was craving pizza after the Grape Escape. It was twenty after ten on a Saturday night. It made me sad to hear your kitchen closed at ten. *le sigh*. Not to worry, I love you anyway. You just can't be my semi-late night pizza place is all.","We were looking for a snack during the day and stopped in here. We picked up a grandma slice of pizza and a bruscetta. We really weren't expecting much but they were delicious!  So surprisingly good!  I'd definitely get them again from this place.","In a nutshell. . . . - Beer/Wine selection was decent. Not many mixed drinks but not what they promote either. . - Food was really great. We had the roasted cauliflower pizza. It was crisp, generous on cauliflower, seasoned perfectly. . - The service was the standout. Brandon T was our server and he was just amazing. Polite, friendly, and made us feel at home. . Great dinner experience.","If you're in this area during the early morning hours, around six, stop in. . I promise it'll be worth it. . The cashier, has both arms tattooed with images of the entire Addams Family. . I'm not joking. . I stood there mesmerized for a moment, staring at who I thought was Uncle Fester from The Munsters, but got it wrong.  . He was quick to correct me, informing me it was actually Grandpa from Addams. . That's when Morticia, Gomez, and the rest of the gang began to come into focus on both arms. Fucking hilarious. . The guy was a good sport as I laughed my ass off walking out the door, him laughing too. . You just don't see that shit everyday. So for this reason, I'm giving this place my highest Diego rating ever.  . And forget about an egg sandwich at this hour. All they feature in the glass oven is corn dogs stuffed with cheesy jalapeno sauce. , pizza, and hamburgers. . Ewww. . I did get two hard boiled eggs in a package for ninety nine cents.","If you are looking for an authentic NY style pizza, this is the place to be. It's in the middle of the Fashion Show mall on the first floor right in front of the catwalk, across from the Apple store. They provide both indoor and \"patio\" style seating facing the mall. The restaurant itself has a lot of NY decor including pictures and signs. . The servers are very attentive and the food comes out pretty quick. It's perfect to come and eat on ur own too since they do offer personal size pizzas and bar seating. I am a small girl, so i wasn't able to finish the personal pizza, so maybe a man  would be satisfied with a personal. . I would reccomend asking for extra sauce, just because i felt the pizza was a little dry with the normal amount of sauce it came with.","This place is a tucked away little gem in the burgh. The atmosphere is. . . interesting, but the food is delicious. Their white pizza is the best (with tomatoes). Their Pittsburgh salads are humongous. If you haven't made the trek to this joint in the run, you definitely should. You may find yourself taking your friends their to show it off. . .","Great service! We go here quite often for a pitcher of Keiths and wings. WISH they had wings on Friday nights (only Mon &amp; Sat) they hands down have terrific pizza and the steak sandwiches are ALWAYS cooked to perfection. The garlic bread is the best I have ever had and we always get some to go and the potato skins are LOADED with cheese and bacon- Yum! The staff is terrific and always prompt. . . . There is definitely a \" neighborhood watering hole\" kind of vibe to it and A LOT of regulars. If your looking for a casual/unpretentious place to grab a beer and bite, I highly recommend.","Delicious! Had the Calabrese pizza and mixed green salad with lemon vinegarette. Can't wait to come back!","This was so unexpectedly good! We were going to eat at two places before we walked by this one. i couldn't see a lot of customers which always makes me nervous but I Checked our the menu and it was appealing so we decided to go in. The server was very nice and said he would recommend what I was thinking about having, the salmon pizza - it was unique, served on naan bread with a chile aioli. My fianc\u00e9 has the bone in rib eye --also good and we shared the Brussels sprouts side --amazingly surprisingly good. Sliced Brussels sprouts sauces prior to roasting and served mixed with chorizo, cranberries and sliced almonds. Nice touch!!","If you like thin, New York style pizza, this is the place to go! The slices are huge! The dining area was clean, and the people working there were friendly and helpful. It was probably one of the best slices of pizza I've gotten in Pittsburgh. Believe me, I've eaten a lot of pizza. . .","I LOVE the pizza here. So good. Thin crust, great sauce. Wish they had a 'little' better wine selection but otherwise I love this place. Had pizza and a house salad. The salad was yummy. Lots of stuff in it. All in all I would recommend this place for sure. It's not the greatest location but since it's been there for over three years now, looks like it's gonna make it.","*Really good atmosphere, service also was perfect!. I visited the restaurant many times, and regularly they provide me good quality food and service. . Firstly I LOVE the chicken &amp; shrimps spaghetti! It was obviously delicious. Of course, I highly recommend this. . Last time, when I visited there, I ordered Roasted fennel &amp; sausage fettuccine and Mario pizza. Every dishes were really good. And server constantly checked our table, and he was very friendly and nice.","I am just not to crazy about this place. . Some of my friends who work near me took me here saying it was amazing. The full and hard to navigate parking lot I thought may be a indicator that this place was good. . We had a short crowded wait inside, and then we made it to our table. . I went with a salad as I was told they are the best. However it was mostly just ice burg lettuce, some feta  a few olives and a small bit of pita. . The pita was good, but otherwise my salad felt like a ripoff for $8 and I was still hungry, . I may go back and try the pasta or a pizza but I am in no rush. . Maybe some people are just crazy to liek Jim's?","Really depends on what you take as there is a bit of everything -- stir fry, sandwiches, pizza, pastries, and probably more. . But whatever you take, don't get the italian sausage hotdog. If you're craving italian food, get a slice of the american-version of pizza because holy shiznit was that hotdog dreadful. . 'So how exactly do you mess up a hotdog?', you ask. . Well. . . . The sausage tasted like the saltiest wiener and had the color and consistency of ham. There were very strong flavoured pickled veggies in a sweet dressing (1/10 for taste) that covered up every other flavour, which means the whole thing tasted 1/10. . The italian sausage hot dog may have been designed to appeal to italian students, but all it's done to me is turn my italian craving upside down. . Short note on pizzas: cheese pizza tastes/feels dry (never thought I'd described cheese as dry). I find the pepperoni much easier to eat for a mere +60 (or so) cents.","A good meal overall. We came earlier on a weeknight and were seated right away. The seating area is pretty big. Our server was working multiple tables and he was hustling. He did a great job.  . The big disappointment was the garlic knots. This place has some nice ovens. . . and they deep friend the knots. They were ok, but greasy. I'm sure they would have been a lot better in the oven.  . The pizza was good!  It was a little underdone for my liking. Being from the New Haven area, I like a bit of crisp. I was kind of surprised they cook the pizza at 550F. That seems a bit low for a restaurant oven. My wife's salad was very good. Good selection of beer and wine. It's a bit spendy for what it is. . . . but you're eating on the strip.","I am obsessed with Hob Nobs breakfast pizza and the crack potatoes they serve as a side. My husband orders the build your own omelet and always really enjoys it (even though I eat his potatoes). This most recent time he ordered the waffle with cinnamon sugar apples on top and he enjoyed it (mentioned he would skip the whip cream next time). We opt for the bottomless mimosas and depending on who serves it they are either super weak or very generous. I appreciate that I don't have to wait until 10-11 on a Saturday to eat breakfast/brunch in central Phoenix and Hob Nob has a very warm and welcoming family feel. They offer a full bar, a great case of pastries, and a delicious menu! If you haven't checked it out put this on the top of your list.","It was absolutely freezing in there. The pizza was undercooked and they forgot part of my daughters order. Best part was the chocolate chip bazooki!. Don't know if I would come back to this location","We got takeout pizzas. They were very good - good crust and tasty toppings. I'd go back but only to eat in the restaurant. Atmosphere seemed cool and pizzas would probably be even better fresh out of the oven.","It been a few years since I went to the original sight of Pizza Nova. It was always a nice place to get a wonderful pizza. I was pleasantly surprised to find the location had been renovated. It's a bright and welcoming location and still service. . The menu has been expanded and my meal was fantastic.","I was quite surprised that this quality can come out of Glendale!  I'm not a huge fan of deep dish pizza but I will make an exception for Vito's!  I crave it nightly. I have had pizza from the best places around the world (Lombardi's- Manhattan, Gino's east- chicago, Giordano's - Chicago, Grimaldi's, Pizzeria Gino Sorbillo-Milan (voted best in ITALY! 2015), Juliana's - Brooklyn, Spinato's, AND Little Caesars (right. )  It's crazy that Vito's, for me, ranks among them!  If you decide to try, you won't be disappointed. The location and atmosphere screams \"average at best\" but try to look past it and get a pie.","As much as I love Oregano's, I have to give the Glendale location a bad mark. I went there last night with my 2 sons. We got there at 5p and were told it would be a 50 minute wait. I decided it was worth it, so we stayed. They were passing out free slices of pizza, which was nice and some people were offered drinks. We were not so  I went inside to get a soda from the bar. Once inside I noticed that at least 1/2 the tables were empty and the few that were seated, not one of them had food yet. Most of the staff seemed to be standing around doing nothing. We ended up leaving after an hour once I realized we'd be waiting another hour for our food. They obviously have some kinks to work out, which is expected when it's new, however they should have enough staff working to handle the volume.","Everything I've ordered has been perfection. . My first comment is they're always early for delivery. They guestimate usually am hour delivery time and each time it's been about 30 minutes. Food faster than I expected? Yes please. . The fact they have aranchini at ALL surprised me but they definitely didn't disappoint. Perfectly crisp on the outside and not oily, cheesy meat delisiousness on the inside. An order comes with 4 and some marinera for dipping. I'll just ask for extra marinera next time cuz I'm a sucker for sauce. . Next the Mediterranean salad. A salad is a salad right? No. Lots of lettuce and huge pieces of grilled chicken. I'm talking charcoal grilled that you can taste a bit of char on. Yeah. Salad's sounding pretty good now isn't it carnivores? My one and only \"complaint\" would be the kamata olives. No flavor, more like olive shaped salt vessels but I know they don't make the olives so they get a pass on that. I also like that it's served with cucumber salad dressing instead of a traditional vinaigrette. With artichokes and olives the cool cucumber dressing was a much better option. . The truffle pizza. Not for the faint of heart. Seriously. It's a no sauce pizza but worry not, it's delicious none the less. Cheese on cheese, prociutto, roasted garlic so it's packed with flavor. HOWEVER. It is SALTY. one of the cheeses is fontina which in itself is salty, plus prociutto, salty cured ham, roasted garlic PLUS the richness of truffle oil, it's not a pizza that you can sit down an eat the entire thing in one sitting. My roommate tried. The flavors are great but intense so if you're determined to eat the whole thing asap I'd recommend a side of marinera or (dare I say it?) Even ranch will cut some of the intensity so you can stuff yourself until you explode. . Next we ordered a large pizza with Alfredo sauce as the base with tomatoes and mushrooms. I had to call and make sure the adjustments I made when ordering online went through and the woman who answered was a bit surprised I wanted Alfredo sauce instead of marinera (blasphemy, I know) but they made it just the way we asked and it was delicious. Their Alfredo sauce isn't overwhelmingly garlic which is great cuz most places go overboard with it, and it was nice they used sliced tomatoes instead of diced cuz diced ones just fall off. Perfect thin crust. That pizza barely made it to the next day. . The last pizza we ordered from them was simple. We had ordered fancy, we had ordered \"custom made\" so I thought why not go for the basic? I wanted to see how they do pizza when it's simple and no adjustments made. That pizza was the best. I ordered their basic pizza which had crushed tomatoes in lieu of sauce (I KNOW), cheese and fresh basil strips. The tomatoes were definitely not canned and I think they stew them themselves or at least marinate them in awesome because they were packed with delicious garlic flavor. There was enough cheese to coat it but not so much that the lack of sauce became a downfall and the fresh basil strips were the perfect seasoning. Simple can in fact be perfection my friends. Highly recommend taking the easy route. . Another easy option that earned good points with me was their \"side\" salad. They call it the mixed greens with an option for a half or full order. Ordered the half and it was still huge. What I enjoyed most was they used darker greens instead of the traditional romaine. There was lots of spinach and some purple leaf I couldn't recognize (not purple cabage), cucumbers, big pieces of red onion (great if you wanna remove them) and tomato. It comes with basalmic vinaigrette which was just sweet enough without being too sweet and they provided enough to actually coat the whole salad. Definite win.  . Last and certainly not least, the eggplant parmesean. After being a vegetarian for many years eggplant has become a favorite food and it's always hard to order it somewhere and expect to be satisfied. And yet I was. Perfectly crisp outside, soft enough to chew through easily but not so soft it was mush, just enough marinera that they didn't drown and enough cheese to placate any italian. It's served with angel hair pasta with marinera and basil. I normally don't like angel hair because it's so thin it tends to stick together like a clump of play dough pasta but it really wasn't stuck together at all. It also comes with some kind of bread, clearly homemade, which was a bit dense so I did without. . All in all I love everything they've made me. I guarantee I will order from them again and I'm definitely gonna try and deversify my orders so I can get the best of everything. Keep up the good work guys!","I adore, love, stalk and smother this place. Amazing. I can go on and on about how fantastic it is and you are checking this review to see if you should go. Well. . . go! Gorgeous interior, large attentive bar, outdoor seating. Great for a girls night, after work, first date, romantic before or after anything. Sometimes we will be out to dinner elsewhere and it's time for dessert so we skip and come to humble for more wine and their amazing desserts instead! The chocolate tower by far is the best cake I've had at any restaurant and the peanut butter ice cream on top I want to bathe in. The humble pie and rasberry crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e which is a cake not a traditional br\u00fbl\u00e9e are to die for. . All of the food is delicious and the pizza (when I ate gluten) was perfectly made. If I had one criticism it would be to add a couple more gluten friendly/paleo options (grain free) like mussels. . . that would be amazing. In all honestly, it's a great place with a large wine menu, perfect atmosphere for any occasion and delicious food and desserts!","So so good! Diverse menu with sandwiches, soups, salads, pizzas and even phenomenal seafood dishes. Well-crafted daily specials along with a savory assortment of classics (burgers, appetizers, etc) and unique entrees (Bourbon Glaze pecan Crusted Salmon is amazing!). Definitely a neighborhood jem! Small dining room means get there early, or be ready to wait, especially During the winter months","The Canadian bacon with sauerkraut pizza is amazing! Their sundaes are mighty tasty too. We had excellent service and a really good time. We will be back.","We finally made it here to try the pizzas we heard so much about. Since it was just my husband and I , we split a Mixed Salad and a Margarita Pizza. He also ordered a Strawberry milkshake. Let's start with that one. It was really fabulous. Real strawberries and cream and cherries on top. A five star milkshake. . Next , the salad. Also a five star salad. Mixed greens with grape tomatoes, red onion and shavings of a good Parmesan cheese with just the right amount of dressing. As a bonus , I added some of the complimentary olives that were delivered to our table almost immediately after sitting down. . Now the pizza. We've eaten a lot of Margarita pizzas over the years. We have a gold standard that we compare all to, made by our friend Billy, served at Ianni's in New Derry. This one wasn't quite as good. . The crust was excellent. Perfect in fact. But the toppings were off. Not enough basil , and the addition of either a Parmesan or Romano cheese to the mozzarella didn't work for us. Still, we thought we will need to come back and try some other toppings. Perhaps a White Pizza with sausage or another Specialty Pizza off the menu. . Service was excellent, atmosphere was good, industrial vibe carried out well. The place was very clean. All in all a very enjoyable visit, just a bit disappointed after all the hype we had heard.","Location is Eastern and Windmill in the Smith's Shopping Center. Lots of people walking into this place (good sign!) The sign out front advertised a large cheese pizza special for $9. 99 (sweet deal!) Always skeptical of reviewers saying pizza tastes like New York pizza. I get excited just to be disappointed but the pizza was pretty good and it is close to the pizza you get in New York. Look forward to trying EVERYTHING on the menu. So happy we found this place THANKS FELLOW YELPERS!!","These cupcakes might be my kryptonite! . The store is small, very cute &amp; the service is awesome. . I'd already been bad all weekend (I'm not going to name names, but someone ate an entire 1/2 medium pizza in one sitting, &amp; it was me) so I decided to use some self control &amp; limit myself to 1 cupcake. . After much thought, I chose the PINK CADILLAC. Heaven all mighty, it was everything a cup cake should be &amp; so much more! By far, best cupcake I've ever had :) Yes, they are on the sweet side, but they're supposed to be! They're cupcakes, not a fruit salad. . On a side note, my nephew had the chocolate &amp; caramel cupcake &amp; said it was now his favorite cupcake. He finished it in a minute, which was impressive since the cupcake is almost bigger than him, lol","This is not a joke review - this place had the best value breakfast I have found in the city - a pizza place. I prefer spending a little more eating at Senses or Le Select Bistro - $20 each, but at Rustico you get a better value fill for $10. And I dont want to speak of the low quality of Cora's again. Cora's is passable but I cannot cook that average a quality meal in my own home. . So, Rustico, I got their special - it had bacon, eggs, home fries and toast; pancakes and fruit. Coffee as well. And I was pleased with the service and the food, mostly. The food was all great quality and big portions, except for the fruit - too much of it, given that it was half spoiled. . Anyway, I just had to write this one because I was stunned to find a great place for breakfast right outside my place - and that it was in a pizza place. It's great. Try it out and let me know if it is consistently good. Thanks. . Addendum: This venue no longer serves breakfast during the week.","Let me first start this review by saying I'm a Chicago native. Born in the city and raised in the 'burbs. I've eaten, at least, 100 pizzas at the various Giordano's restaurants in the Chicago area; all of them a stuffed deep dish pizza. Giordano's used to be my all-time favorite pizza, up until about 12 years ago, or so, when they changed. This was just before their bankruptcy. . When they came to the Phoenix area, I was excited, hoping they had rebounded back to their previous glory. Peoria is an hour's drive from me, but we went there the month they opened, as I had to try them. The pizza was not great, but there was hope, as they had just opened and all restaurants have a shaky start when they first open. . So, we gave them the better part of a year and tried them again a couple nights ago. Sadly, the pizza was even worse than it was before. The crust was dry and bland, unlike how it used to be. The amount of sauce looked as though someone brushed it on, you could see the top layer of crust. The amount of ingredients (sausage) were also low. If you like a lot of cheese sandwiched between two layers of bland crust, brushed with a light coating of sauce, you might like this. . I want to like their pizza, as I miss the old Giordano's taste. Unfortunately, I fear they're gone forever, replaced by this pathetic version of what was once the best pizza ever.","Sat at the bar on a Thursday evening after work during happy hour and it wasn't busy at all. Maybe due to it's location or the fact that it's still really new in the shopping center. It's very nicely decorated and spacious once you walk in, sort of unexpected because of the shopping center itself. Service was prompt and friendly!  I ordered a glass of Jellybean red wine blend to go with my Balsamic Chicken with sauteed spinach. I had a hard time choosing between the Balsamic and Joe's special, which looked to be very similar on the menu. The Balsamic was great, seasoned a lil strong, but still really good. It came with two chicken breasts, a lot for me, so I took the second to go. I'll definitely come here again to try Joe's special among other things like the bruschetta and pizza!","Outstanding dining experience!  Heard about this place when we first moved to Arizona about a month ago and tried to come earlier but due to the spring training being here the line was always crazy!. Finally got to experience this past Wednesday and I can totally see why the long line. Our server, Lynnette was awesome!  Always tending to us and making sure we didn't need anything. All the while tending to all of her other tables. . Ordered the Numero One-O pizza, garlic bread and a simple house salad that was huge! Everything came out quick and very delicious. . my wife and I will definitely be making Oregano's a regular spot for us.","We eat piazza at least once a week ( maybe that's the Italian in us) . My husband, the kids we all love this place. My kids are extremely picky eaters. If it was for them we would have pizza everyday. But not any, only nello's. Actually we just had it for dinner last night. It was so good.","Oreganos has one of the best pizzas, my children and I love to eat here so friendly and delicious food.","And little box by the river serving delicious lobster rolls in the summer at a reasonable price. Also does lobster pizza and a surprisingly good clan chowder. Lobster was fresh and you are given a good sized portion of it.","Perfect pizzas and good service. I highly recommend this place. Clean place and fast service. . Meatballs pizza and 3 cheese pizza are the best.","Awesome pizza, awesome people!  One of the best pizza's I've ever had, and tasty Italian beer to boot!  The guys'that were working their were really nice too. . I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area!","Tasty, thick crust pizza in the strip district. Decent wine/beer selection. Definitely feels 'real' and not pretentious. Plenty of TVs w/ hockey on. I could see being a regular if I move to the Burgh.","This is my new favorite wine bar, hands down. Immediately upon entering, I felt the stress of the day leave me. A warm fire from the stone pizza oven was ablaze, chandeliers made of wine bottles decorated the booths, and rustic bar and table tops were scattered throughout the restaurant. We sat at the bar, right in front of the fire. We ordered the best winter sangria I've ever tasted--my friend described it best \"like a cold mulled wine\" which sounds awful but is actually amazing. We each had a glass and split the 4-cheese pizza. I found a slice (or 3) of heaven that afternoon and definitely plan on going back to see what else I can fall in love with.","Char has the greatest pizza with the freshest ingredients! I love the atmosphere and the outdoor area with games that make the dining experience fun for all. I would absolutely recommend Char to anyone and everyone!","I visited Rocco's based on Yelp recommendations and I was definitely not disappointed. I must point out however, I am not a NY Pizza expert by any stretch of the imaginiation. I would have given Rocco's 3 stars, but it earned an extra star for reasons explained below. . The prices are a touch on the pricey side, I think it was about $3 to $3. 50 per slice and a slice is a little over 1/8th of a 18 inch pie. The crust is thin, a little chewy and very pliable. In genuine east coast fashion, they reheat the slices of pizza you order so they come to you nice and hot. I had the pepperoni and sausage and sausage and mozzarella pizza. The all meat pizza was a bit greasy and nothing special, but the sausage and mozzarella wasless greasy and very tasty. I also ordered a small order of freshly made caprese salad. Which brings me to the reasons why I gave an extra star to this restaurant. Friendliness of service and selection of goods. . The owner (?) was super friendly and let me buy a smaller single serving size of the salad which was greatly apreciated. There are also rice balls, homemade cannoli and zeppole on their menu. If you are still hungry after your pizza, you can buy some dried pasta and canned tomatoes in their small deli section to take home!","After reading good reviews online, along with a friend's high recommendation, I decided to order from Sal's for the first time and was rather disappointed. They were out of an appetizer I wanted, but I guess I can forgive that, seeing as how it's a Saturday night. So instead, I ordered wings, which were rubbery in texture. I also ordered two pizzas, both with pepperoni (and other toppings), but did not receive pepperoni on either pizza. The sauce was pretty good, but the crust was on the chewy side and I prefer a slight crunch to my crust. Perhaps I'm too picky because I grew up in the Northeast, where the pizza is unbeatable. All in all, it's not the worst pizza I've had here in AZ, but after 2 years of living out here, I still don't get why almost all pizza tastes the same (and it's not that great). I might order from Sal's again out of geographical convenience, but I won't be dying to order any time soon. . . . The atmosphere in the restaurant was cute and clean, and the staff was very friendly, which earned them my two stars.","If you love pasta, you will love this place! . Everything is fresh, even the pasta is made there. So when you walk in you will get a Vapiano's credit card, you go in and order whatever you want. They will charge that credit card, and you pay before you leave. . They have pasta, Panini, pizza, and calzones (which looks really really good, have yet to try). Then after you leave you pay. It gives you a really good vibe, and good food, what else can you ask for. . I had leftovers, and I think leftovers were even better. . I am defiantly going back, I have to try the calzone and get the sangria, heard good things about it!","We love this location. . . it seems for some reason they have the best pizza. . . my son loves the carousel. . . so as long as my son is happy I will keep returning","I am not to happy with this location, I ordered pizza thinking it would be delivered fresh. . First thing was it took them nearly 2 hours to deliver and Pizza Hut sent me an email stating it was just going to be 45-60min. . Second, when the pizza was delivered it tasted like old pizza, as if it was sitting in the drivers car for awhile. . Overall, not just they're service was terrible but the quality of pizza being made at this location isn't acceptable to me. . 8/5/2016 1:40pm. Tried giving them another shot and hopefully getting better customer service. Unfortunately nothing has changed ordered my food 11:57am I get the confirmation stating it will be delivered at 12:55 pm. I called the place at 1:00pm confirming if it was made and delivered, guy tells me they were waiting on driver. I call back at 1:30pm a lady with a rude attitude answers and I tell her the situation and told me the driver didn't have my unit number and my phone number was listed wrong on the order. They tell me they have to put in the order again and remake it. I figured through my name and me ordering there my information such as my email, previous number from last orders would be posted. I'm just hungry and haven't gotten any good customer service","Great atmosphere and amazing food. Love the scotellinis and pizza. Have yet to try a pasta dish! The eggplant puree is divine and my pizza favorites are the mozzerella and the pepperoni. I have tried the wild boar twice and it can be quite greasy.","I've been here 4 of 5 times and always had a decent  experience. However was there Friday, July 6, 2018 and was disappointed. The drinks were fine but the Pizza was half raw and the other was burnt. At these prices I would expect better consistancy. As I said the drinks were fine but I really had a hard time justying the $335 bill plus tip for 4 pizzas a couple of appetizers and drinks. . . . . DISAPPOINTED. . . .","This is a MUST STOP place in Fountain Hills. The cheesecake is AMAZING - save some room! The cappucino was as smooth as the cheesecake! The waiter - the tall guy that ducks every time he goes under the archways - was super friendly and entertaining . . . That extends to the two owners: making sure everyone feels like part of the family at dinner! real Italian food, wood fired pizzas - can't ask for more. Join us for happy hour Saturday - we are coming back for lemon cheesecake and some Italian cookies Maria is making special!","Pizza is made on a conveyor belt oven, not a traditional pizza oven. Dough is made different, tastes different, and has a different texture . Sauce and cheese is OK, but they destroy the pizza by placing oregano on it. Only Greeks and Mexicans place oregano on pizza. Definitely not a New York Neopolitan style pizza! If pizza was made like this in the REAL STREETS OF NEW YORK, they wouldn't last a week! The only thing I can compare this pizza to is Lil Caesars. So, if you like that type of pizza, it's the place for you. If you're from New York and know what NY pizza is don't waste your time.","I asked the waitress if the meatballs were homemade. She dodged the question, so I insisted she ask the chef. She came back and told me the meatballs are fresh if you get the spaghetti. I got the spaghetti and meatballs, and those were not fresh. The sauce was watery and bland. We also had the Alfredo sauce. That's the most bland sauce I've ever eaten. Hope the pizza is better.","Like most people I know, there is nothing better than a good pizza. They put it in your hands at this amazing find. You choose the sauce, cheese, and toppings, and out comes your personalized thin crust pizza. Great concept, great quality.","This place is just awesome. . You can't say you don't like your pizza, because it's made to order!  Fresh ingredients, 3 different types of crust. The employees are always smiling,  &amp; very friendly. . . Absolutely love this place!!!","We check this place out on recommendation of our Uber driver. He was spot on. . We had a great seat outside, with a beautiful atmosphere including some Street music. Service was quick, and our order came out fairly quickly. . The pizza was super good. I had one that was mozzarella black olives and mozzarella chunks. Finished all of it. . Overall delicious food!","Had a house salad, 16 pepperoni, sausage with extra sauce. All great. They charge for extra sauce which I do not like. But pizza is AWESOME and salad great","Looking for an authentic, Roman-style pizzeria caf\u00e9? Novanta is your place. When I say Roman-style, I mean the type of caf\u00e9 you would find on the streets of Rome. For me, Rome means you can eat nearly anything on the menu, and you know it's going to be fresh, local and delicious. That is Novanta. I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. We always order the salad (to share) and two Margarita pizzas. . Don't know where to begin. I suppose I could start with what it is not. It isn't \"stuff your face\" pizza, like many cheap delivery places. This is hand tossed, wood-fire pizza that has a crusty, chewy base. It's topped with incredible sauce and homemade mozzarella cheese slices. One word: Incredible!  The salad was very fresh and topped with imported olive oil, balsamic vinegar and shaved parmesan. . The price is a bit subjective. Pizza was $7. 75 each and the Emiliana salad was $7. 50. Now, some people may say, \"Hey, I can order a Pizza Pizza from Little Cearser's for five bucks. \" Yep, they certainly can, and will have about 8 more slices of cardboard, who-knows-where-it-came-from pizza-like thing for nearly the same price. But, that's not Novanta. I have never been disappointed with a meal from here and would HIGHLY recommend it.","We ordered one of the specials 10 chicken finger, 20 chicken wings, a one topping large pizza and 2 liter for 39. 99. I also checked in so I got an extra 2 liter for free. . Pizza was good, crust and as soft and crunchy cooked just right. Wings were amazing!!! I ordered them well done and plain with the sauce on the side (I hate soggy wings) they were perfect. . Chicken finger tasted like good normal chicken finger. . Homemade ranch . . . . need I say more?! . Soda selection was small but who cares we were already eating pizza we didn't need soda hehe. . When I went to pick up they were somewhat busy and they still offered to help me out to the car. Food was ready at the exact time I was told it would be. Will be returning for some wings ! Yum!!","This was my third and last time at Ilios Noche. I went when they first opened and they were clearly not ready for customers. Our food took forever and our server was completely inept. I gave it a second chance a year ago and the service was not much better. The food has usually been pretty good on both visits, it's the service that kills the experience. I decided to give it one last try this week and again, the service was not good. We even sat at the bar because I thought it might be a little better there. . . . wrong! Slow, slow, slow. It took forever for us to get drinks. The bartender spent more time talking to the other servers and at the service bar than waiting on the bar patrons. Our food was okay, nothing to get excited about. The meatballs were good but not very hot. I ordered a salad, which came out in a warm bowl so the lettuce was warm. I sent it back and got the exact same thing. The pizza was okay. I guess everything was okay. Nothing spectacular. We waited forever for the bartender to run our credit card. I finally had to get the manager to do it and he didn't apologize or ask if everything was okay. I really don't think he cared. This was my last visit to Ilios Noche. Too bad. I love their other location.","I consider myself a gazpacho aficionado so of course I order the heirloom tomato gazpacho at Astoria Cafe &amp; Market after my better half noshed his way through the west side Market a few miles away. Imagine my surprise - an amuse bouche if you will when the deftly balanced gazpacho had watermelon in it. It's quite honestly one of the best things I've ever eaten. EVER. I observed artfully prepared pizzas and salads and cheese boards swirling around me amidst cases of charcuterie and olives and such. . . . Chef Jamie is a rock star and in Cleveland - that's no easy feat. . . .","every time someone recommends the place, I cringe, unfortunately in the area, it's about the easiest place to dine, that being said their pizza (the only thing on the menu) is terrible, i truly prefer the crap thy used to serve us in middle school. . My tip, drink a lot before going so that you don't care about the state of the food","Great place to grab a quick bite at lunch with really good prices for lunch specials. Soup and salad, small pizza, or soup and half sandwich are less than $10! All ingrediants are fresh and the service is friendly and fast. Never have to wait for food more than 5-10 minutes a the most.","So I hate to write a bad review but I'm all for giving any place a review if it was anything below or above average. Honestly, this was way below average. The pizza was literally the worst pizza I have ever had, ever. . it seemed as if it was left out all day, it was hard and very dry &amp; they forgot my ranch :( the only reason I gave two stars was because my cheesecake was really good &amp; the delivery guy was bad ass, I liked his attitude &amp; just all around good vibes. The guy on the phone whom I ordered from was also very polite and nice. Just really bad pizza. If you guys can fix that, then you would be grade A.","Overall the food was average for the price. $13 for side of Cesar salad that has four roman lettuce leaves. This Wolfgang Puck is definitely not as good as the others. The pasta was overcooked and the pizza was burned on the bottom. We has to laughed when the breadstick is just wrapped in napkin and left on the table without any container.","On a recent visit to Montreal, Else's provided a welcome respite from the unseasonable cold. It was recommended by a great friend and former grad school classmate who is now studying at the nearby McGill University. She lives close by, in a lovely neighborhood near Montreal's pleateau, and this is one of her favorite local haunts. If I lived here I could see myself returning to this cozy, mellow establishment during the day with my book or laptop to relax with a cup of their excellent cafe au lait, or at night with someone I want to get to know better. I sipped my coffee during the evening too, but for those interested in something stronger there is a full and interesting cocktail menu (my friend gave her exotic tequila beverage a stamp of approval) along with a selection of hard cider and wine. Their food menu is filled with tasty looking small bites, such as open faced sandwiches, a platter of Indian treats like fragrant samosas and pakoras, and a variety of pizzas. Its worth noting that their liquor licensing is limited, and any drinkers need to order food to accompany their libation. With two dollar cheese bread with salad on the menu, that's not hard to accomplish on a budget. With its dim lighting, casual eclectic decor and thoughtful music selections (we heard everything from Fleet Foxes to Frank Sinatra), Else's is an ideal neighborhood gathering place.","One thing I've learned in my many years is that if a restaurant is located in the heart of a tourist trap, it doesn't have to be very good to be packed with people. That being said, this place wasn't very good. . . But it was packed. . The pizza was decent but of course EXPENSIVE.  My sons lasagna looked like it was Russell Stoffers microwave lasagna.  . The waiter was this rude, bald guy who barely spoke to us. . . I think he hated tourists that ate in a tourist trap. Very odd. He could've gotten us to drink 3 more beers each but he never asked us how we were doing. . . So we left. I hate how you almost HAVE to leave a tip when waiters suck this bad. . I'd skip this place and eat at Restaurant Taberna all week because it's awesome.","Their 'lunch special' is available until 3pm!. I picked three dishes to bring home for dinner. . . (2) ravioli and (1) tortellini. I chose the rose sauce which is marinara and alfredo mixed together. We loved our meal!. There was a wait for the food but that's because it was freshly prepared as ordered. It was also a generous portion. And the server was friendly. All worth the wait :). We will dine here again for sure and probably try the brick-oven pizza next time!","This restaurant serves EXCELLENT pizza. The stuffed mushrooms are also delicious. I have had a few different pies here and each one is delicious. Great wine and beer selection too. Definitely will come here again.","I am very particular about my pizza- I like it thin, I like it crispy, I don't like too much sauce, I like a tasty dough, etc. Sauce was awesome! At first I wasn't sure if I could eat a whole 12 inch by myself. . . well, I ate all of mine and one slice from my moms! I had the portobello and artichoke and it was so yummy! Cracker thin crispy crust, tasty, not oozing with sauce- perfect. My mom's chicken and broccoli was good and so was my sisters pepperoni and sausage. Side thing for me was that they had diet dr. pepper- one of my favorite drinks ever and most places do not have it from the fountain! This was our second restaurant in the Fox group and they are obviously doing something right! We will be back when we come visit again!","Stopped by on Saturday afternoon for lunch. We were seated within a few minutes and greeted by the manager who welcomed us on our first visit to CPK. Our waiter and the rest of the staff were very attentive and friendly, it's one of the best customer service experiences I've had at any restaurant. . We ordered two pizzas and one salad. Our food was quite good and the prices were reasonable. The menu seems quite varied and includes a lot of options other than pizza. I also noticed they had a couple craft beers on tap, which is always a good thing. I would definitely come here again the next time I'm near the mall.","I have driven past Luigi's hundreds of times and read the mixed reviews here on Yelp and elsewhere, but on Friday I was out with the kids, with whom pizza and pasta is always a hit, so this time we finally stopped in. They were busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table. . Unfortunately, we waited a while for the busy server and for our appetizers (although the entrees came out very shortly after the apps). The dough knots were well baked, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, with a golden brown, buttery finish and topped with parmesan. Good appetizer. The garlic cheese bread came out about 10 minutes after the knots. If it had been 8 minutes, it would have been perfect -- it was a tad overcooked. The marinara dipping sauce for both appetizers was fresh and thick, if a bit heavy on the garlic. . . The kids ordered their $2 entrees (yes, I said $2 kids' meals!!!) -- buttery pasta and an individual cheese pizza (the sausage was $0. 50 extra). The blood orange Italian soda was refreshing on this mild summer evening. I had a 12\" sausage &amp; tomato pizza. The cornbread-based crust was crispy and the tomatoes were fresh if not plentiful. This pizza is more than enough for two people; I brought half home for my wife. . One star for fresh ingredients, one star for $2 kids' meals, one star for a 4/5* pizza and one for the excellent desserts (you can tell they're a sister restaurant to Hubbard Ave. ). If you're expecting gourmet Italian, you'll be disappointed; for casual dining with a good variety and value for families, Luigi's hits the spot.","Always liked the spaghetti and marinara sauce. Haven't tried the pizza yet. But overall it seemed like a nicely run place. Food was very good. Friendly staff. Kinda in the middle of all the business plaza but nice and quiet.","Everyone needs a great neighborhood bar, and D's is mine. Of course, those near and far are drawn to its extensive draft list, infamous beer cave, intriguing mural, and the mighty beer chiller. Just an aside. . . D's has been doin' da damn thang a long ass time. . . aeons before lots of craft beer under one roof + good food was chic in this town. Respect. Yes, it's standard bar fare, but they do it quite well really. . . the daily specials are money and Wednesday's O. G. dog 'n fries for a scant $6 is my go-to. Choose from a signature recipe dog or BYOD with toppings galore to choose from. Beware of their beer battered fries -- doesn't matter if you order them or not, you'll still smell like a deep fryer when you leave so you might as well get 'em and I bet you can't eat just one! Dogs not your thing? No prob! There's always pizza, sammies, and wings (oh my!) to fill your tummy. Service has always been friendly 'n fast and it's kid friendly. So be a good neighbor, come to D's. . . where everybody is your buddy.","Doesn't get much better than this. This is real Vera Pizza Napoletana. The ingredients are top shelf, and the wood fired oven is the real deal. It cooks the pizza perfectly at 900 degrees, as is required for VPN style pizza. The prices are excellent, and the casual pizza parlor type atmosphere is nice. You would normally pay nearly twice as much to get this kind of pizza in Las Vegas from the other VPN style pizza places. If you want great VPN pizza without breaking the bank, this is the only place you need to visit in LV. . One must understand that this pizza is the opposite of commercial pizza. This pizza is exactly how it is made in Naples, Italy. It is a very simple and delicate flavor starting with the dough that takes 24 hours to rise naturally, without chemicals. The dough is very light and has a subtle natural flavor. They use Caputo flour from Italy. The tomato sauce is simply crushed tomatoes with a little bit of seasoning. The mozzarella is fresh and delicious. They have dozens of toppings, but I would recommend the plain margherita so you can savor the flavors of simple ingredients. Loading it up with toppings completely masks the essential ingredients; dough, tomato, cheese. Pizza was never meant to be a casserole, so try to enjoy the pizza for what it was meant to be. . Lastly, you need to eat it hot out of the oven for the maximum enjoyment. I would not recommend this type of pizza for take out. It's very thin and cools very quickly. . This place has truly duplicated genuine Italian wood fired pizza at its best. Enjoy.","Maybe I am not a pizza person. Had a couple of friends highly recommend this place. Tried once, ok but nothing stood out.","I love the cannolis!!! If you like thin New York style pizza this is your place to go.","I have been to 56 East Bar and Kitchen a handful of times and always have a very nice time. Corey, the bartender, is very attentive to everyone. He made great suggestions on menu selections. Honestly, I never would have ordered what I did but he explained what the item was and I tried it. It was a pizza with egg on top. Sounds awful, I know,  BUT it was awesome. We all loved the  food. We could actually talk to each other and carry on a conversation. So many places are too noisy. I really like 56 when they can open the window behind the bar. My only suggestion might be to find a way to have some plants behind the patio to block the view of the parking lot. . This is a real review of a place I have actually been to!","I'm impressed by the customer service at this location. The staff is friendly and greets you when you come in. All of them are smiling. Great atmosphere. l ordered a pizza to go and my order was more than I thought it would be because of the way they charge for toppings. They immediately discounted my order and apologized for the confusion. I will eat here more often because of my experience.","I'm sorry, did I just take a bite before a picture? Omg yes. This place is amazing. Thin and crunchy crust; perfect sauce to herbs ratio; tasty and warm cheese; pepperoni slices to top it all off. . . one word: PERFECTION. I don't think I've had a bite of such tasty goodness in so long. My friends, above all, this slice cost me $3. 75. Yes, I want to cry tears of joy. . Trust me. When you see the man tossing the pizza dough from the outside window, you will know that this pizzeria is in it for the long haul. There is little indoor seating though, so hopefully you are coming to taste this pizza on a good day. There are some picnic tables on the outside of the place for you to sit. . I heard that there's also a spicy oil that you can add to enhance the flavour. So keep posted for the updated review!","I ordered food here and got delivery. It took a little longer than expected. I ordered a white cheese pizza, there chicken dinner meal, and cheesy bread. The pizza was so bad I ate one slice and couldn't eat anymore. I gave my husband two slices on his plate. He took one bite and told me he couldn't eat that. It tasted like dough and a thin layer of cheese. Couldnt even taste the sauce and when I lifted the cheese I couldnt even see any sauce besides crust. The pressure cooked chicken however was delicious. The cheesy bread was for my husband and he liked it. Overall experience was ok. I just wont order that pizza again.","Great pizza and wings for the money. Crust is on the medium thickness side which i really like, sauce is tasty and they are generous with the cheese and toppings. . Wings are large and the sauces are good (Especially the Honey Hot and Sweet Chile). Ranch and blue cheese are good as well. . If dining in they have good prices on beer as well.","Poor excuse for pizza. Ordered 2 toppings which were tossed on &amp; pizza slice not re-heated. Pizza was \"dry\". Service was prompt.","I just enjoyed a classic Italian meal that was surprisingly delicious and nuanced. The place itself is unassuming from the outside, but given that it's March and 3 degrees F outside, it's no wonder they keep the shades drawn. Entry is through the side hallway in winter since they close the patio. . Once inside however the restaurant itself feels a bit cavernous, but very comfortable; with a split-level floor plan and small bar area. It was sleepy at 7:00 pm on a midwinter Wednesday, with a few solo travelers like me and a few couples, and one larger family party in the corner. . The service is friendly, attentive, prompt and unpushy. The menu is classic and simple. . I had the Caesar salad, the Agnolotti and the Tiramisu. Each dish was very delicious and exactly what I was hoping for. I could say something here about \"travelers should be grateful such a place is nearby since not much else is;\" but frankly, the place is good and would do well anywhere. . I also ordered a pizza to go since the Tripadvisor reviews were all about it; I was full from dinner but it smelled so good I had a bite and it's awesome. Pizzas are made and cooked to order, thin crust, and done in an open fire brick oven right there. . I'm here for six more days, and I'll definitely hit this place again.","First time ordering pizza I ordered the 2 pizzas and 2 liter soda. The order took almost an hour. . Then they said they have Sprite instead of 7up as I was paying I said I will take the sprite. he pointed to the cooler and said it's over there. I guess that means I'm getting it. Then they expect a tip. Not even a thank you. No customer service skills what so ever","Very poor customer service. When I ordered online and my pizza didn't come, I called them and they told us that sometimes their websites don't process orders completely, and it would take them another 45 minutes to make the pizza. Then it took them an additional 40 minutes to deliver the pizza, even though I live only 5-10 minutes away driving time (I don't own a car otherwise I would have eaten elsewhere). When I went to pick up pizza, the driver's friends were in the car with him - why?!. Do not order from them. This is the kind of place you go at 2 in the morning when nothing else is open and it is the last option for food.","Got pizza by the slice at the to go counter two different times and both times were yummy! Great place to hit up at midnight in the casino if you've been drinking and need something to soak it up. The forager is delicious, great combination of spinach, mushrooms and whipped ricotta, hit the spot. Also has a slice of the Gotham which is your more traditional pepperoni and sausage, really tasty,  both had great crust! Definitely will have to try for a sit down meal next time, their mozzarella bar sounds super interesting.","Awesome spot for Italian food. Went into it expecting a solid meal and was not only not disappointed, but also incredibly impressed. I ordered the mushroom risotto with truffles and my boyfriend ordered the pizza with arugula and prosciutto. Really awesome meal and great vibe!","My Friday night experience at this popular culinary destination was incredible. Not only is the decor visually appealing, but the DJ spinning tracks aside the bar set for a great date night atmosphere. The service from beginning to end was attentive, while our conversation remained uninterrupted throughout the night (except to deliver each course timely). . My wife and I are burrata aficionados, and the execution here was top notch. The cheese had the right balance between being creamy inside and slightly firm on the surface, and it was seasoned just right with cracked black pepper and sea salt. The verde salad and was a nice complement, and our waiter's recommendation to pair with their house tomatoes was well received. . I'm a huge fan of Neopolitano style pizza, and this pizzeria did the genre justice. Each ingredient was distinct and full of flavor, and every bite made it more clear that the meal was made from scratch. . This is one of those places where you're tempted to return the next evening. Swing by if you're in town.","If you've been to Napoli, Italy and tried pizza from L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele you will love Buca's Pomodoro E Tartufo ($29). They use a moretti forni oven and the crust is baked to perfection. The sauce is very lite and sweet and is topped with basil, truffled burrata cheese and scorzone truffles! . Unfortunately they were out of truffles at the time we went, however the pizza was still absolutely incredible! . My second favorite dish was their Baigoli (torchio extruded duck egg pasta). I'm not a huge fan of ordering pizza and pasta in the same meal but this decision I was not disappointed with. The sauce was the perfect consistency and the pasta was cooked al dente.","When you're having a crazy day and there's no time to cook but the idea of takeout pizza one more time makes you want to scream, this place comes to the rescue. Lots of pre-cooked meal options and nice soups and salads to choose from. The gazpacho (only available in summer) is amazing. They also have a selection of sandwiches and baked goods which are pretty good. Most of the time everything is top quality and well prepared, once or twice I had fish from here that was not super fresh. It didn't make me sick or anything, it just tasted slightly off. It can get pricey fast, as most things are priced by weight, but it's generally good value. Service is usually friendly and efficient. Once or twice the guy who served me even threw in an extra baked good treat for free. All in all, a great healthy alternative to takeout now and then!  And gazpacho of the gods.","I've seen this place half a million times since I live in the Whitney Ranch area, and finally decided to go give it a try after they sent out a letter to all the residents in Whitney Ranch. . Was happy to see they use EAT24 so I can order online and take advantage of our weekly coupon, but even still, the price of the large (16\") veggie pizza &amp; garlic knots were on par. . Coming from the east coast, Boston, I'm always on the lookout for east coast style pizzerias. When I think east coast pizza I think of Boston's and New York's thin, flavorful style. This pizza was more inline with what you expect from Pizza Hut. Thick, boring dough, and bland sauce. While eating we had to add dried basil to our slices because there seem to be a local lack of seasoning in the sauce or cheese. . Overall, it was just a pretty boring pizza. It wasn't horrible, but the 'Meh. I've experienced better' 2 start rating is right on the nose.","Vig is a quick stop to eat if you're wandering around the M. I really like their food selection and everything is very good. Prices aren't outrageous for the portions you receive, and the food is fresh. The service was friendly, mostly self service. I love their foot long Chicago dogs. Not just like the real thing, but a taste. Their pizza slices are huge and tasty. Stop here if you're hungry and not in the mood for anything super fancy.","My favorite pizza place in a 5 mile radius. I come all the time, and love it. Popeye n olive oil, hang ten, blonde on the beach, pepperoni and garlic. I cant get enough!","When the elbow room  is crowded and you're craving pizza, come right next door. Owned and operated by the same folks, Bites and Brews is great. Lots of great beer on tap. I love everything of the Bell's variety in the summer. The pizza is delish. Especially late night.","I could have went to Little Caesars but I went here to get pizza instead I don't know what I was thinking. The good thing was the employee rush to get me Ranch. Awesome people.","Best best best!!!  Everything a former NY Gal could ask for!!  The heroes are awesome. The pizza is awesome. The canolis and zeppolis are to die for!!! If you are looking for authentic and I mean authentic NY Italian, this is it!!","A-OK is pretty much the best way to describe Flour &amp; Barley. I have no complaints, but there wasn't anything particularly memorable about the meal or service either. . I dined here recently before seeing a show at a nearby hotel. We were seated immediately, although it took some time before our server ever made it to our table (no big deal). . We decided to share the garlic cheese bread to start, and it was good. We then shared the Calabrese pizza, which was topped with meatball, italian sausage, prosciutto cotto, mozzarella &amp; chili with salsa verde. It was yummy. I also had a glass of their house wine. . Overall, it was a nice little meal - but as I mentioned, nothing special. The prices are on the high side, which is expected due to the location (I am not complaining, just pointing it out).","I've made several visits to the Vig, and have been very happy each time. . The first was one of the first HOT days in May. I was job hunting, and decided a happy hour cocktail and bite was in order. Three words\"  TAKE BETHANY HOME!  It's the first on the list of \"vignature\" cocktails. . . and one of my new favorite drinks. Julia was behind the bar, and had enough time to exchange a dirty joke with me to make me feel like a regular. Two drinks and the happy hour sliders. . . YUM!  My only complaint. . . and this is the kind of complaint I am sure the owners love. . . there was too much food!  I am a big girl, and I can put away the chow. . . but two drinks and an appetizer and I was uncomfortably full!  Didn't even finish the fries - which were great, but I was too full!. Second time was happy hour with a girlfriend. We sat on the patio, shared a couple cocktails (I am stuck on Take Bethany Home, she tried the Moscow Mule. . . which was also great. )  We split the artichoke dip and the flatbread pizza. Both were great. . . but once again - same issue. Two women who are not afraid to eat - two cocktails and two appetizers. . . and there were leftovers!. Another solo happy hour - I think I have it mastered. . . the wings are the right amount for one person and two drinks!. Was in last night for the ribeye dinner special with my mom and her husband.  (YAY for industry and facebook fan discounts. . . I fit both categories!)  Mom and I had Take Bethany Home, her hubby had a couple Juan Gambinos. For a man who only drinks scotch and water, I was impressed he left his comfort zone. . . and as he ordered a second, it must have been damn good!  All three of us had the special. The ribeye was well cooked and flavorful, the corn on the cob was a bit plain, but that's A-OK with me. The potato salad was super fresh, very cold and quite tasty. Then there were the baked beans. WOW!  I could make a meal of these alone!  (Gonna ask for the recipe, for sure!)  Mom ordered the brownie a la mode for dessert for the three of us to share. Personally, I was so full, i would have gladly skipped - but good thing I didn't!  The ice cream, caramel and chocolate sauces were good - but the brownie itself was perfect!. I complain about the portion sizes only because it limits what I can try on one visit. If there for happy hour, one app per person makes sense - more than that is too much food. If for dinner, and all members of the party are getting entrees, best to skip apps completely. Really - one dessert should not have put three people over the edge of too full!. Service has always been prompt and professional and I will be back again and again as long as they keep up this level of service and quality!. (Even more often if they want to hire me as a bartender!!) :). Oh - and the fact they use the picture I took of Take Bethany Home when advertising it on facebook makes me feel VERY loved! :)","Tomaydo Tomahhdo is strange to me in that it is EXACTLY the type of place I seek out when traveling: inexpensive, lots of fresh ingredients, not a (huge) chain, vegetarian options, etc. However, since I work nearby, I fear that I have come to the point where I take it for granted and haven't been there all fall or winter. . Every single morsel of food I have ever had from TT has been outstanding. The best thing ever is the Sonoma salad with raspberry dressing. Yum!!! But everything that is baked (focaccia bread sandwiches and of course, that delicious flatbread pizza with sweet, tangy balsamic drizzled on top) is so delicious as well, not to mention insanely delicious-smelling as well. . By the way, if you are ever walking down East Ninth and you are about to pass this little plaza (next to a Subway) and you don't have time to eat, do yourself a favor and cross the street, because smelling that delicious Tomaydo Tomahhdo aroma and not immediately getting a pizza or sandwich to stuff into your face would be pure torture!","It's been around for as long as I have been in the area. I came here when there was nothing to eat around my work. Prices have always been very reasonable, and I prefer 241 pizza over Pizza Pizza any day. Came here to get dinner for the fam and they have new walk-in specials: 2 small pizzas + 2 toppings and they gave me a dipping sauce for around 10 bucks! People come to grab quick easy dinner, and not expecting a gourmet scene. Just your standard good ol pizza spot in the area.","A little bit far but worth the drive there. . Crust is thin and crispy. The ingredients are fresh and yuummy. As i am writting this, i am craving for some right now. . My favorite rome type of pizza in mtl.","Everyone here complains about the price. . . and yes, your going to get a little sticker shock for what looks like a mall food court. However, this is not Panda Express, and you will not need your Chipotleaway for this meal. It's the MGM, the nations largest hotel and tourist trap and my meal here (with double chicken and noodles) still comes in for about $19. I've been charged more for breakfast at the MGM Diner.  . Just take a look at your other options. . . you've got $5 slices of bad pizza, or you can dare to eat McD's or Nathans. The bowl of ice cream at Haagen Dazs will likely do less damage to your body over those two fast food giants. . Back to Asian Fresh. . . lots of fresh veggies you pick out, quality chicken breast, and who doesn't like Stir Fry? Filing and good, and plenty of selection with various meats, veggies, and other add ins available. A nice spicy Kung Pao sauce too. . They do need to add some Brown Rice into the mix. How that continues to get overlooked year after year still surprises me.","Very underwhelming! The only things that stuck out for me were an apple tart that was in the pizza section, orange chicken in the Asian section and the corned beef hash in the breakfast station. For $19 food should be better prepared and fresh. They had a sushi station but it was nasty. Will not return.","Custom Built is a friendly and casual place for great tasting thin crust, wood fired pizza. I love the quick service and how you can build your own pizza with as many toppings as you like without an extra charge for each one like every other pizza place does. Also love that they have a loyalty/rewards program with Belly on your smartphone - so easy to use!","WORST PIZZA EVER  &amp; I EAT A LOT OF PIZZA. Staff was nice and very accommodating but the food was awful. Don't know what they do with their Itlaian Sausage but it wasn't chunks, it wasn't crumbled it was kind of thin sliced and torn into little pieces. The pizza seemed wet on the edges. I took that to be because the did not drain their mushrooms or vegies before putting them on top or maybe it was not cooked long enough.  . Hand leftovers  decided not to eat them.","Went here for the first time and for the most part I am impressed. There are a few things that they should consider in order to elevate their food. We ordered bruschetta to start. It was mediocre. By adding some feta and some balsamic drizzle to the top it would have elevated the taste. The canadese pizza was really delicious. For dessert, we had a dessert pizza with cinnamon apples on top. It was good but could be elevated by adding a caramel drizzle to the top. We did order wine and thought that their choice of wine glasses need updating. They only seem to have one type of one glass which doesn't necessarily work with every type of wine served. They should invest in wider base wine glasses. Overall I would recommend. Hopefully these recommendations will be taken to heart.","*AMENDMENT*. Ok I am amending my review due to the fact that I've now been in Cleveland almost 3 years and our experience with OCP has gone completely downhill. The pizza is still \"ok\" but over time has gotten greasier and greasier. I think the fact that they put the 'za on wax paper, which doesn't absorb anything, causes the grease puddle - however, I'm not claiming to be a scientist. . The reason for the 1 star rating is as follows: Someone who works at OCP gave out our personal contact information to a delivery driver. My boyfriend started receiving text messages FROM THE PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVER on a social level on nights that WE HAD NOT ORDERED A  PIZZA. Creepy as shit, right? Right. Needless to say we haven't ordered pizza from there again. . . (shudders). . ++++++++++++++++++++++. My boyfriend and I just moved from Chicago and have really become accustomed to thin crust pizzas. Actually I'd consider myself a pizza snob, so the task of finding a new pizza joint in my area seemed rather daunting. I was told to try Ohio City Pizzeria, so I figured we should start setting them up and knocking them down as quickly as possible. . The woman on the phone was extremely nice. When I asked if they made 'thin crust pizzas' she said she could make it as thin as possible, which was fine by me. I ordered my pizza and it was delivered to our apt in Tremont in 45 min. Everything went smoothly and the pizza was really good. . I'd also like to add that they have green olives as a topping option and apparently that isn't a standard topping in Cleveland, so they get brownie points for that as well. . I can't speak to the actual establishment because I've only had delivery. . We've been in Cleveland for 1 month and have ordered pizza from OCP 2x already. I'm definitely going call them again.","Service was great and salad was good but pizza wasn't as amazing as I expected it didn't live up to the hype for my boyfriend and I :/","Me and my boyfriend went to Akira Back for a little celebratory dinner. We ordered the tuna pizza and t. Truffle bomb croquettes for starters. The pizza is amazing! Perfect for sharing and definitely worth the price! It looked so plain and simple but theres so much flavour. The truffle bomb croquettes were pretty amazig as well. Very complex flavours that work really well together. You get 3 small bites for $25 so its a bit pricey. We ordered unagi roll and uni sushi, both tasted really fresh. The unagi roll waa good but nothing special. The uni sushi had a very generous serving of uni on top. It was good but not as good as the uni from Yasu's premium sashimi add on. We were still a bit hungry so i ordered the grilled alaskan king crab legs which were SO good. I'vr never had anything like it before. The crab tasted sweet and fresh and the flavour had a bit of a kick to it. My boyfriend had the ab wagyu tacos. The beef was cooked bulgogi style, which was a little too sweet according to my boyfriend but still good. Our faves from this meal: Tuna Pizza, Truffle Bomb Croquette, Grilled Alaskan King Crab legs","We came in with a group of around 20 and got a whole section to ourself(thanks to reservation). The waiter was kind and kept his cool. I know if I was a waitress I'd be freaking out with all the people. I ordered the ravioli and had to wait a little, because of all the people. The edges of it were cold, but I didn't really care, the inside and cheese were warm, that's all what mattered to me. I recommend this place. I didn't try the pizza, because I hate any pizza but my parents really enjoyed their pizza.","I'm a transplant from the northeast and Rocco's is legit NY pizza. As good and authentic as the places in my old neighborhood - I was very glad to discover Rocco's.","Amazing place. Great food and such a kind staff. We order and pick up at least once a week and we definitely have our favorite things to order: Wings &amp; fries, pizza, and salads. . But honestly last night we had the Bolognese ziti and it was awesome.","Vito's has the best Chicago style pizza in the Valley. The owner is friendly and truly cares about his product. He recognizes my wife and I every time we visit. We always have good, service and excellent food.","I have never had a bad experience at barros. We've been coming to this location since I was in elementary school, I still remember when they were at the place around the corner and had a little ball pit!! Haha great times, delicious pizza and awesome service!","I've been in AZ for 11yrs by way of NJ. . So when I happened on this place I fell in love. The best NY style pizza I have tasted since being back home. Mmmmm and their hot wings with fresh garlic, as I love them, to die for! Don't forget to add a big pitcher of cold frosty beer! Now you got yourself a Friday or Saturday night meal!!! The pizza &amp; wings are my fave, so much, I have never tried anything else. So yes, I would have to say this place has the best pizza ever! (Been eating here for years). BUT wait there's more!!!!. I will never ever ever eat there again!. I would rather buy a pie from Walmart &amp; pop it in the oven at home! And the wings, I throw down myself at home, hot, lemon pepper, teriyaki, spicy garlic. . . . . whatever flavor I can make that right at home!  . Why? I thought you'd never ask. . As my family &amp; myself dined one evening on a pie, wings &amp; beer, just as we were finishing up our meal my daughter looks to the side towards the back of the store and there the owner is sitting at a table picking his nose feverishly, mind you there's a bathroom right behind him if he needed to go and clean his nose, therefore wash hands when returning to work. As a customer enters the shop and stands at the counter waiting to place an order he gets up and goes right behind the counter and serves this customer food, never ever stopping to wash his hands!!!! . It's times like this I wish I was an undercover food inspector!!! . Now if you have read any of my other reviews you can tell I am a bit of a germaphobe. And this little stunt  and booger the owner has pulled, has lost a customer in me and my family forever!!!. This review gets one star because I cannot give it anything less and like I said their food is the best so if you do not mind a little boogering in your food, then go for it!","This place is our Cheers! Great staff, cold beer, and well-above-average food. (Get the Reuben. . . or the southwestern eggrolls. . . or the Augie Dog. . . or the pizza. . . )","I was recently there for a birthday party. My 1st impression walking in, I would give them ZERO stars! 2 girls at the desk, 1 on her cell phone, the other one not even bothering to look up. No \"hello\" or \"be with you in a moment\". Some people were asked to sign in and some weren't?!? We explained that we were there for a birthday party and they just looked at us like so what? The place was SO packed! I was shocked at how many kids were everywhere running around. Apparently they allow unlimited walk ins during birthday parties with no limit as to how many people can go in. This surprised me as the party we were with had 40 people - half of which were kids. There were 6-7 kids at a time on the trampolines, 2-3 kids at a time going down the slides. It was a free for all and utter chaos. 3 staff members and nobody monitoring the play area. Girls at the front were on their cell phones or doing something on the computer. There should be limit as to how many walk ins they allow during parties. Forget about renting the place out because it costs $1000 for a private party and you can only have it from 6:30-9:30pm!?!? Seriously??? Pizza is from Pizza Pizza. If you're going to charge almost $600 for a party with 20 kids you better be serving pizza from Pizza Nova or Pizzaville. Staff is not kid friendly at all. Always annoyed when you go to them to ask a question or to ask for help with something. It was my 3rd time there and 1st party. Not impressed at all!. The facility itself is clean and top notch, but the owners need to hire some qualified staff. They also need to take safety into consideration when they have parties and unlimited walk ins. I can't even begin to imagine what it would've been like if there were parties in each of the 4+ rooms and walk ins. Also details in their party packages are not clear. I was looking at pricing and asking a few questions and they didn't seem to know what they were talking about. No nuts allowed in their facility but the offer cake from Dairy Queen for party packages? FYI Dairy Queen is not a nut free shop, so therefore the cakes are not nut free. . If you can't be bothered to monitor the play area and have parties &amp; walk ins at the same time, you better be asking every single person that steps foot in there to sign in! That is a big security &amp; safety issue for a kids playground. . Very poorly run indoor playground.","Always a great atmosphere and service is amazing. And let's talk food as you know I'm about food. Yum yum yummy. We've come and enjoyed time during the swing and graveyard shifts and the food is consistent and timely. I recommend their Greek Salad  which is amazing. Also they now have personal size pizza  and if you've ever had the Hidden Pizza at Cosmopolitan it tastes just the same. So in other words you won't go wrong with anything you order. On last item that's a must their French Fries  dipped in ranch or by themselves they are wonderfullllll . . . . . so when you get the chance stop by Winchell's have a few drinks, play a lil poker or Keno at the bar and eat some food and make sure you say hi and take care or those waitresses, waiters, and Bartenders","Been to 3 of them in Chicago and was anxious to try it in Phx. . . . . . Arrived and was on waitlist with 35-40 minute wait - not a surprise. Waited about 10 minutes for the rest of our party before we had to ask if we could order the pizza. Again, we knew it would take about 40 minutes for pizza to cook. Was a little surprised the host didn't mention this to us. . . so thankfully we knew. . Ordered a deep dish pizza and got seated about 10 minutes later. Timing is perfect so far. . Sat down, ordered drinks and an app - the weird calamari thing. Yep. . . should've read it. Calamari was good. . . fried lemon rings? Yuck. Fried green beans had no snap. Bleck!  Other stuff was yucky, too. This was a bummer and totally our fault for not reading it. Oh, and had to get up and get our silverware. . . couldn't flag down a server if we had been on fire. . Waiting for pizza. . . . yawn. . . about 1 hour after we sat down and after we had pre-ordered. . Another waiter came around and was offering some guests food dishes free of charge because they knew pizzas were taking forever. We were one of these tables - so that was nice touch. . Refill drinks were slow. . . . very slow. . Finally pizza came. . . . and it wasn't even hot. It was an edible temperature. When our waiter finally came back around, we mentioned the pizza was not hot -  so obviously it had been sitting for a bit before it got to us. . He told manager who came over to talk to us. She offered to reheat or give us a discount. We had already each eaten a piece. . . so a discount was fine. It was still tasty. . Turns out, they comp'd the entire meal. . . was not expecting that. We really would have been ok with a discount. . . the pizza was still good. . . but certainly not like it was in Chicago. . Hopefully. . . . . hopefully. . . this was a total fluke and not the norm. . . . otherwise, may have to go to Lou Malnati's on Camelback Ave.  :-0","We wanted pizza and decided to try something different - Magura was close enough for delivery, so we gave it a try. . I ordered a Quattro fromaggio pizza, a meaty pizza, and an order of mushrooms. . Delivery was quick, much faster than expected. The driver arrived within 30 minutes. He wasn't super friendly, but he did have to wait out in the heat for a minute because I didn't hear him knock. . The two pizzas were tasty. The crust was thin and crisp. A number of reviews complained that it was soggy, but we didn't have that problem. They brushed some garlicky oil on the edges and gave it a nice salty tang. I loved the white pizza. No complaints. . The mushrooms were ok. I felt like it was a really small portion for the cost and they weren't special in any way. . I'll probably order pizza from them again, but no apps.","One of the best pizza places in Toronto. Incredible Fritti and appetizers. Great service. Wonderful experience in general.","Loved this place. . Best pizza . Amazing deserts. Great atmosphere . Best Italian resturant in valley. . I true find!. a must go!","Dear foodies, . As many of you may know, I do not normally give a restaurant or bar less than 3 stars. I must give this place 3 stars because their beer selection is very limited and boring. . The lemon drop martini that I ordered was prepared pretty well, but did not blow my hair back like at some other places. . Lastly, the food. . . Well, as a foodie that loves to cook and explore in the kitchen, I was underwhelmed by the tasteless dough that they use for their flatbread pizzas. I have made better pizza at home than this place. I have never had such lackluster pizza in my life; I ordered the vegetarian pizza, which they claim has garlic, spinach, onion, tomatoes, etc without the \"special topping. \" I requested that the \"special topping\" be placed on the side. The pizza came out and I asked the bartender, where is the garlic, she said that the garlic is only found in the \"special topping. \" The \"special topping\" consist of garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. How tacky and unappealing. Where are the real pieces of garlic? Also the other veggies present were scarce and lacked in flavor as well. . I needed to wash down the nasty pizza and ordered a pumpkin pie vodka drink and that was yummy. But, no one could go wrong with this since it only consisted of pumpkin pie vodka, ice, and seltzer water. . The live jazz band made the experience tolerable but I will never good back. I was initially excited since I had never been here prior to that night. . Yikes!","I just moved to the area and was told that the pizza at Petti's was the best in town. We called and placed a pickup order for a cheese pizza and a side of rigatoni alfredo. The pizza sauce is great, the pie itself could have been baked a little longer. The alfredo was not what I was expecting but delicious. We will be back!!","Excellent meatball sub. Good pizza and stromboli selection. Salads too. Fast and easy. Plenty of seating. In E Concourse.","When I first saw the size of a slice of pizza at Benny Fiero's, I assumed it was just a gimmick and the pizza wouldn't be very good. Boy was I wrong! The pizza is thin until you get to the end of your slice and that's when you start to get full. Eating more than 1. 5-2 slides would be impressive. . I ordered delivery from BF's once and the pizza box was so large that I had to angle it to get it to fit through my front door! For $30-35 you can feed 4-6 people which isn't too bad and it's fun to eat such an enormous slice. I did the math - one slice at BF is like 3 slices of XL pizza elsewhere, but keep in mind it is effectively thin crust pizza.","This place is just ok. Nothing special. Marginally decent bar food. Had a pizza because I was was the most appealing item on the menu. Again, just ok.","If you want FRESH pasta, Vapiano is the place to go! They have the tastiest pasta with tons of different options. They also have pizza, risotto, and salads! This place is particularly cool because you walk right up to the chef to place your order and they cook it in front of you! Pretty cool to watch your food being made fresh. Only negative is it is a little hard to hear the chef sometimes during the lunch rush. Overall, great place with amazing food. It's definitely a hot spot in uptown for lunch so go early!","My husband arrived at the D gates of Terminal 1 at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas with not much time prior to boarding and STARV-ING. There is a serious lack of decent food options that are quick at this terminal. One pizza place, a place to by box sandwiches, chili's too with a 40 minute wait and Quizno's. . We avoid fast food like a plague for its general low quality, high fat/calorie counts and poor nutrition. We figured a sandwich would be better than pizza, I mean how can you mess up such a simple thing as a sandwich? Ha. . . ha!. Now I will say this, my husband ordered some sort of cold cut variety on whole wheat that had a lot of ranch dressing on it and he said it tasted pretty good. He was so hungry I think he downed it in 4 bites. I tried to go a healthier route with their veggie guacamole and had it grilled, or was that toasted - I'm not sure - on parmesan bread. Here's my review:. Service: friendly and quick. No complaints here. . Food: Ugh. My bread was spongy, tasteless, really gross. The veggies on this veggie sandwich were black olives, TONS of diced purple onions, mushrooms and shredded iceberg lettuce. Does that sound like a veggie sandwich to you?? Does that even come close to sounding appetizing?? Where are the peppers, spinach, tomatoes?? Two layers of cheese, swiss and cheddar with a little squirt of what I think was Italian dressing and barely detectable guacamole all mushed into the lettuce. It just had no taste. A pile of tasteless unappetizing vegetables on spongy, tasteless bread. Odd thing is the sandwich looked great but did not match the flavor. I ate less than a quarter of it just to tame down the hunger pangs and the rest went in the garbage. . Two stars is for the quick friendly service, I would give zero for the food if I could. Believe me, I am one on yelp who consistently gives the benefit of the doubt to places but I advise you to go elsewhere for food.","I am from Chicago and I like this pizza. The salads here are yummy too. We have been here a number of times and it does not disappoint. The apps are fun too.","The ultimate in neighborhood restaurants!. Friendly service, generous portions, very good food, fun happy hour. I have ordered to go, enjoyed a fun filled happy hour of regular  hard working folks who are regulars or new but welcomed. You won't feel alone or awkward here. The Lasagna is great. Pizza too. And during happy hour at the bar a pizza slice is a dollar. Other choices are as reasonable and just the thing to handle the hunger after a day at work. Lots of authentic Italian choices. If their garlic bread was better I'd have given this place five stars. . But again it's just the place to relax and unwind with good friends and good food and drinks.","I could eat the garlic chips all day. Their . 50 beer is great deal. Their pizza is good also. Would give it 4 stars but the host few months back was very rude and condescending. She's young so I'll try to not take it too personally but humbleness and humility will go a long way. Just few days ago, the waitress brought out the wrong order too. I like this place enough to go back but with better service, I think this place has a lot of potential.","I should start by saying that I don't go out to restaurants of this style very often. \"red sauce Italian\" is something I usually cook at home, but my wife was in the mood for eggplant parmesan, and we were in the area so. . . . Apparently, Santosuosso's is an offshoot of Santo's in Middleburg Hieghts, which is closer to Cleveland, and the menu is very similar from what I hear. We spent quite a while deliberating over what to get, as the menu is organized into so many categories, it makes it hard to figure things out. Pastas abound, and come with most everything on the menu, whether it's Veal, Chicken or seafood, although I did see that they had grilled steak, salmon and pan fried walleye on the menu, which was nice to see. . My wife ordered The eggplant Parm, which came with a choice of soup or salad; she opted for the Caesar Salad. As I usually do when I can't decide what to get, I order way too much food. In addition to a white pizza with fresh tomatoes and herbs, I also ordered what was called their \"signature salad\", with field greens, balsamic, garbanzo beans and bacon. I also ordered a veal florentine sandwich for good measure. . Our salads arrived very promptly after we ordered, along with some nice simple italian bread I used to mop up some extra dressing in the bottom of the salad bowl. . When our entrees arrived, I was stunned. My wifes eggplant parmesan was beautifully presented, with four nice sized slices of eggplant and a side of perfectly cooked spaghetti. . My pizza was flavorful, with a nice hint of garlic and a kick of basil. The veal florentine was very tasty, with spinach and garlic, but the butter that the spinach was cooked in kind of made the sandwich a bit too heavy. tasted great, but it was like lead. . All in all, It was refreshing to see that this style of restaurant can still be very good, and in addition to the great food, the atmosphere was very relaxing and the service was comfortable and relaxed. I also noticed they had a nice bar area, where I wouldn't mind sitting to have some wine and something to snack on should i find myself in the area again.","Located right across the City Hall/Eaton Centre, this small restaurant, part of the Oliver &amp; Bonacini chain, offers seasonal menus featuring Canadian cuisine. It also features a \"to-go\" area if you have limited time. . I opted for the Arcadian chicken pot pie and it satisfied all of my cravings with rich creamy flavor. I also had the infamous duck poutine pizza which was so massive and filling! Though the menu may seem limited, there's something for everyone! Unfortunately I didn't have room for their desserts so that will be a must-try for me next time! S'mores pie, I will get you next time!. Overall, I was very satisfied with how this place accommodated my party of 19 with great customer service!","The Good: Food! We ordered the pretzels with beer cheese and two pizza's. Food tasted great!. The Bad: Sad to say the service was lacking. Once we were seated we waited at least 10 min before our server took our drink order. We had a couple of questions that just seemed to confuse the server. Beers and pretzels with beer cheese were ordered. Server came back to take our order and said our dinner would be out before the appetizers. Confused since she hadn't even put our dinner order in yet. We were a little confused on the pricing of the pizza's. If you create your own and want to add a few toppings it comes out to quite a bit more money then if you pick one of their pizza's and change the toppings to what you want so that's what we did to save some money. Pretzels did come out before our pizza's so that was a plus but there was no mustard on the plate. The response was \"Oh did you want that?\" I guess not. My husband then noticed a dead fly in his beer. Super grossed out we decided to ask for a manger. She replaced his beer and said sorry. I was kind of surprised to see that we still had to pay for the beer. He never did drink all of the new one he was super grossed out. . I'm sure we'll be back to try the food again but will probably give it some time for the service to improve.","I've eaten at Mad Jack's twice and have had two very different experiences each time. The first time, pretty much everything was perfect. They had a delicious scallop special that was right up my alley and kept me stuffed for HOURS. The only downside was the hummus appetizer my friend and I split--I thought it was pretty good. Some nice roasted red pepper flavors and some unique zing, but it was a way to spicy for her. Might be useful to indicate on the menu that it's spicy because while I thought it was tasty, it was definitely very different from what I was expecting. . The second time was. . . less excellent. The server was still very nice but service was very slow and the restaurant was totally out of bread. Every type of bread. Hamburger buns, rolls, sandwich stuff, you name it. Which meant we didn't get bread as a nibble when we were seated and half of the food was no longer an option. I understand that their delivery truck was late, but Heinen's is right down the road. How can you seriously be out of bread? My pizza was good--a little oily--but good. I just wish they had had bread!. After that second experience, I've been a bit reluctant to go back. Either way, it's a bit normal and predictable, but sometimes it's nice to have a predictable lunch place. It seemed like a nice, consistent staple, but now I\"m not so sure. Guess I'll have to go back a third time as a tie-breaker?","The prices are reasonable, the pizza is tasty, and staff is friendly. I've tried all three crusts: original, honey whole wheat, and gluten free. They're all tasty, but I'm excited to say gluten free is the best! It's $2 extra for GF, but well worth it. Try the greek chicken specialty pizza on gluten free dough. . . Mmmm. . . Homemade chicken sausage!","Awesome for meeting and parties, service is awesome A+ there isn't a bad pasta on the menu, all good high quality ingredients. The mushroom risotto is my fav brought out pipping hit with parmiggiano shavings. The antipasto platter for however many quests you have should start your meal off, there is a little of everything and put together fresh. If you like lamb chops they do a nice job here, better than most . You can go into this restaurant and order anything on the menu no worries . Great place . . . . . . Oh and the wood oven pizza is great!","The calamari was good, but not enough. The display was very nice. Been there before, and the pizza was better then. But the sea food soup was amazing. Finished it off with one of the best tasting cappacino","This is the best Barro's in the valley. Pizza comes with a lot of toppings, wings are great, salad is fresh. There have been a couple of times that my order has been wrong, so that's why I didn't give them 4 stars. Other than that, best pizza place around.","Tried this place yesterday. By south tower in plaza casino. Staff was okay, not rude but not super friendly, got overcharged by 10 bucks by mistake, I noticed and they fixed it. . Large pepp. came out nice, and didnt take to long to make. It was tasty, thin crust, only very center was a little floppy, which is perfect, mostly all crispy. Nice cheese flavor. . Ordered 10 garlic knots also. They were not made fresh with the pizza which was a bummer. Fresh bread is awesome, not fresh bread not so awesome. . Feed the family of 4 for around 30 bucks (we had water in the room). Would visit again.","LOVE Teresa's pizza! I just found out that they deliver to my area and I'm super excited! Our pizza is always cooked perfectly and hot! Super friendly staff too!","I wanted to stay in one of Vegas' iconic hotel so what better than the Flamingo. We'll I was sorely disappointed. I don't know what I thought I was going into, maybe 50 fabulous or a throwback to the mob run Vegas. Nope. . . . it was a little dirty, doesn't look like it had been updated since the 80s. . The positives is that it's cheap, super cheap. I think we paid no more than $250 for 4 nights. It's right in the middle of the strip, there were no problems walking everywhere. They have a late night pizza place that will make your made to order pizza in about 20min or you can just grab a slice. . Would I stay here again. . . . . hummmmmm. . . . . . it's debatable. For the price and location yes for the atmosphere no.","I must try the pizza next time! The pasta was OK, I've had better. I had some sort of ice cream covered in chocolate for dessert (small bites), it was so good I wish I had ordered more.","They sure don't make it easy. No delivery, cash only, expensive, a royal pain to park on weekends. At the same time, I'm more than willing to endure herculean trials in pursuit of top tier pizza (hour and a half on the subway to Di Fara? no problem!) . I like the extra flour caked onto the crust, and the sauce isn't bad, but I see and taste nothing that could possibly come close to justifying the $30 price tag on a large gourmet. As a point of reference my favorite pizza on planet earth, Paulie Gee's, is $17. I can assure you PG does not cheap out on ingredients, and there is no way commerical rent is cheaper in Brooklyn than Murray Ave. So while there are far worse pies (really most places in town are worse, and maybe that explains the hype), it's not special enough for the special-occasion pricing.","First timer, The pepperoni pizza was awesome  and the veggi pizza was nice however a little soggy and under done. The brushettas were amazing! The other minus for me was the welcoming not what I expected for my 1st time . I drove across town to try the place a smile would be great also we had no idea how the whole ordering works so we felt super confused. The coconut cake was dry and too sweet it was not butter cream it tasted like store bought frosting not much of coconut flavor even with the shredded coconut on the frosting. Prices were not bad, Would like to go back hopefully the employees are in a better mood.","I love the Cali club pizza and the Cobb salad. The ppl that work here are great!","Top of the line pizza it was by far the best pizza I've had in some time. The other reason why they get 5 stars is that I ordered online and must have miss clicked and didn't get it for delivery. So I called let them know what happen and got the pick up changed to delivery hands down thank you. Thank you for the speedy delivery also it took way less time than what the quoted me for. Good Job team !","Great pizza!  Great staff &amp; service! Great venue to watch the game!","Yummy Yummy Yummy!!!. We went here after a horribly disappointing meal at Dels. I needed Pizza and I needed good pizza!!!. This place did not let down at all! The staff was friendly and very personable. They directed us to their favorite pizza and helped us to make a good choice. I got their margarita pizza and later found out that the owner picks the ingredients daily to make this pizza so it's nice and fresh from the garden. My partner got the stuffed pizza and we were worried that it might be to filling but it was just right. The top was crunchy and had a nice sprinkle of cheese and the meat filling wasn't jam packed with meat but had just the right amount. The crust was nice and thin and had a good crisp to it.  . I can't wait to go back here again, to bad they aren't down the street from our apartment. But I think that if it was we would be the size of a house and the only exercise I would get would be walking to the store to pick up my pizza.  . A MUST TRY!!!","Great pizzas!:. Sacre Bleu: creative, unique, and complex. Bacon Cheeseburger: Rich, heavy, filling, and a safe bet for a group of meat eaters. The Phoenix: Amazing . The Big Eddy: Hello!","The absolute best breakfast pizza I've ever had and from a gas station! Staff is friendly. Easily the best pizza in deforest. I know they do or did deliver but Iive to far out. Worth the drive for pickup though. Gas is always a bit better than the stations near the highway as well.","they suck order online and they don't even get the order right 39$ for 2 medium sized pizza's when ordering 2 LARGE pizzas. . i could have gotten better pizza from manh***en pizza or nap*** pizza. . edit: they call a 14\" pizza a large save your money its a ripoff!","Given that my parents are from Madeira Island, I was super excited to find this amazing restaurant. Lubi took care of us, as well as her very attentive wait staff. The food was amazing. Since I had never tried a pizza with Portuguese spices, I chose this for my entry. It was delicious and minus the greasiness of many pizzas. My boyfriend ordered the meat on the skewer which reminded me of family barbeque's from my childhood. If you want an authentic Portuguese dining experience, I highly recommend that you try Vila Algarve.","This place sucks bad. I'd rather eat pizza patron. And that pizza sucks ass. Nasty ass skinny pizza. No flavor what's so ever. Rather eat dog food. This place will last not even 1 more year.","Rice balls were great. Pizza was average Greek style pizza. Just okay. Meatball sandwich had meatballs in strips that were not fully cooked. Gyro meat was over overcooked. Fries were decent but served with a ketchup bottle that looked like it had been refilled dozens of times. Place is not well air-conditioned. People running the place were nice.","Just got done with lunch. This is the real deal if you are looking for a nice Italian pizza. They use San Marzano tomatoes for their red sauce, which is the only way to go. Their crust has just a hint of salt and is crunchy and chewy all at the same time, simply amazing. The mozzarella was definitely fresh but didn't leave big puddle of water , meaning they probably pressed excess water out ( again the only way to go unless you like puddles in your pizza). Finally I ordered a cannoli that was just as amazing! This is a great place for lunch or diner. Don't worry the food comes out very quickly from their awesome oven!","Seriously soo good! Drove 60miles to come here about 5 times in the 3 months that I lived in AZ. . I came here because of the triple D episode and it was soo worth it! Burgers, fries, onion rings, sweet potatoe fries and pizza are ALL GOOD! . and check out their bathrooms. . its pretty cool too. . Tried Joe's Real BBQ, which is their first restaurant but it was just OK. . Joe's Farm grill is def. one of my fav places. .","I've been so excited to try this place for the longest time. It was everything I had hoped for and more. Three words:. Pneumatic. Condiment. Dispensers. . Okay, folks, I'm a condiment lover. I freaking love me some condiments on any day from anywhere. Put out Ranch Dressing or BBQ Sauce in your condiment line-up and I'm even happier. But put all the ketchup, mustard, mayo, ranch, AND bbq sauce in a shiny metal display and dispense it to me PNEUMATICALLY?????. Freaking hell . . . I'm distracted all the time now because I want to go back and order five different things that I can put condiments on just so I can use the pneumatic dispensers.  . SO FUN!!!!!. Oh, and the food. Okay, I'll be honest, I expected good food. I expected REALLY good food. And I was overwhelmed at the sheer selection of food on the menu, and the flat-panel displays flashing clips of video, pictures of food, and offering me fresh ice cream shakes or fried green beans (which I didnt get but will next time). Ordering (meaning I had to actually CHOOSE) was an exquisite agony. I dithered for no less than 17 minutes, circling the dining room with my iPhone (to read what other Yelpers ate) and clutching the laminated menu to my chest like a crucifix. Once my lunch partners had all arrived, my time was up and I had to enter the line. I couldn't concentrate on the conversation because as we wound back and forth in the line, I was able to see what other people were eating, and what was being served up in the window (yes! you can watch them preparing the delicious food!) which caused me to change my mind several times. . I'm the kind of person who HAS to order last, simply because I MUST KNOW what everyone else is having. It serves to lessen my post-food-arrival regret and that painful longing of \"I should have ordered that. . . . \". The moment of truth came and I decided upon a wood-fired BBQ chicken pizza. And in a gluttonous moment of ridonkulous insanity, blurted out 'FRENCH FRIES' fully knowing that no amount of hours on the treadmill watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes on DVD could ever redeem my choice of lunch. But. . . DO NOT JUDGE ME!  You weren't there watching the orders of fries being shunted out to happy diners. . . it wasn't completely in my control. . Food arrived. I did admire my fellow luncher's selections, but did not suffer overmuch from longing or regret. I had a giant wood-fired bbq chicken pizza with globs of melted fresh mozzarella on it. . . a paper basket of the most delicious french fries of my life. . . and (drumroll). . . . PNEUMATIC CONDIMENT DISPENSERS!. It's no business of yours, to be sure, why I might have needed ketchup, mayo, mustard, ranch AND bbq sauce for my pizza and french fries. But I just did.  . To summarize. . . the food was incredible, nay, transcendant. . . but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.","We were craving good homemade pizza and found this place on google maps. . very very good pizza and chicken fingers! Also was very decent priced. We will definitely order here again.","I'm from nj/nyc so I'm already a snot when it comes to pizza and anything Italian. . We just moved to Glendale from ca. . Which CA has shitty pizza lol. . And we have a restaurant by our old home called NYPD(looks just like the one here). . . Anyway we came here for dinner ordered the mozzarella. the kids a small half cheese/pepperoni. we got a small Wall Street. . Have to say it's petty tasty I wasn't disappointed. . . We will be back to try other foods on the menu . Might be our new spot for some yummy pizza","Great pizza! Reasonable Pricing! Fast, Fast, Fast! Their sauce is great, its got that authentic flavor. . Stumbled into this parking lot on a drinking binge with a friend one time. Saw what looked like a no-name pizza joint, so we both got a pizza, and then ate them right there in the parking. Was so good we ordered 2 more pizzas for the road. . About 2-3 months later in an attempt to reassure myself it wasn't the booze talking, I drove all the way up to Westlake just to order pizza from here. . it was just as good! Good work guys!","I've only been once. A Sunday. At noon. It was very quiet. It smelled clean. Not like pine sol or bLeach. Just clean. I liked the music. The other customers were chill, local vibe. Server Cheyenne was very good; Experienced, conscientious, friendly, on top of everything. I'm vegetarian. I tweaked a turkey wrap to meet my wants. Cheyenne was very helpful and open about this process. The wrap was good for being modified. The tortilla was a little thick which felt doughy in my mouth at times but the inside was fresh. Husband ordered wings. He loved the honey hot sauce she recommended. We shared a pizza. Train crust w Spinach tomato garlic. Tasty. Prices were spot on for this neighborhood. We will be back.","Ordered a pizza for $13. The only cash I had was a $20. The guy shows up at the door \"with no change\" and asked if I still wanted it. So I was forced to leave a $7 tip. Pizza wasn't that great either.","One of my favorite local chains. The dining room was busy but we didn't have to wait for a table. We ordered a large thin crust, side of chicken and a side of Brussel sprouts. I love the chicken and brussel sprouts which I think are phenomenal. The crust of the pizza was good and the topping tasted great as well. I often wonder why the toppings don't stick to the crust though. Seems strange to me but the topping sort of slide off the crust. Like the crust is too hard and the sauce and toppings don't integrate well. I'm o. k. with it, just wonder what the deal is. The pizza is fine, although I will say it does not re-heat well. I do have to complain on the packing of the leftover pizza. If they're not going to put it in a pizza box, then they need to put either paper or foil between the layers. If they don't, the stuff just sticks together and the next day you sort of have a block of pizza slices not individual ones. Our server did put a piece of tray paper between the layers ONLY after I asked her to.","Very different. . . Pasta. Pizza. Bar. . We walked in and were very kindly greeted. Then we were handed a menu and a card. Ummm. . . okay. The hostess then explained that you go to a personal chef station and he will put your order on the card, which you then bring back when you are done to check out. Interesting. . . . The space is huge. Wide open and very airy with apparently 100 year old olive trees and herb plants in terra cotta pots scattered about. The furniture is very mod yet natural feeling for the space as well. . There are several lines form at the long kitchen and they are designated with their specialty (pizza, antipasta, salad, pasta) above on the chalkboard mural. . To quote Tom Petty, \"the waiting is the hardest part. \"  If you find yourself behind someone in the pasta line, as I did, you can expect to stand there for at least fifteen minutes. But in the waiting, you realize that this isn't just someone with a vat of noodles and a big pot of sauce. . You can see into a back room just passed the kitchen that they make all their pasta in house, which they put into serving size containers that they personal chef then cooks. And you have your choice of pasta. . I chose my sauce, sausage e verdure, to add to penne. My friend has scampi e spinach with tagliatelle. I thought it was neat that the pasta was put into an almost timed deep frier (only with boiling water) set up to cook. . We were able to stand and converse as our food cooked, occassionally answering ingredient questions. A little garlic, throw in some spice, et cetera. Our personal chefs were personable and quite capable. . This was gourmet pasta at its best. The vegetables and sausage were delicious and the pasta was perfect. Jen is a what I would consider a foodie, and we were both thoroughly impressed. They also give you some delicious bread with oils on each of the tables. . Getting drinks wasn't inherently clear as far as the process. But they have a full bar at the front which looks well appointed and is surrounded by inviting lounge seating between the bar and kitchen. . I will definitely be back when I have more time. This would be an awesome spot for dinner before an uptown show or drinks after.","Really good pizza and wings at a good price. They have the party pizza which is a HUGE pizza that's great for parties. I haven't really tried anything else except for the pizza but they do carry sandwiches and other things. For dessert you can't go wrong with the cheesecake or cannoli.","I'm not, by any means, an expert on pizza or Italian food, but I've always been pretty happy with the pizza at California Kitchen, regardless of location. But this review is for today, and today's experience has been the best so far. . Todd is a friendly and gracious waiter. He stopped by our table enough, not to absent and not smothering. Very happy with him. . The food portions are pretty large, the half-sized pear salad and the white pizza filled myself and my make companion, no room for dessert. Everything was tasty. We ordered a plain white pizza (not on the menu) to take home for a picky teen, and it came in time, but with a burn sport so they gave us an additonal pizza to take on the house! What service!  We plan to come back.","The pizza has always been good. The service not so much. We ordered a pizza, said I would be there in 30 minutes to pick it up. Got there in 45 minutes and it still wasnt done. They charge you $2. 50 for half full containers of Ranch, when other place give them complimentary. Also, sometimes they charge for them and sometimes they dont. No consistency. Something has also changed with the sauce, not anywhere near as good as it used to be. Lastly, the girls at the front act like they are doing you a favor by helping you. I would say find another place for pizza.","Have been to this place a few times before and hate to say this is probably my last time. They don't have pizza on the menu anymore which was the best thing on the menu. Menu is completely redone I'm not sure if it's due to its new steakhouse concept. Or new mgmt. service was terrible. Really disappointed because this was my go to place in Tempe but I will now find a replacement. Fried pickles were good though","It was a weird night blaze pizza had a line out the door five guys ran out of hamburger buns and I just started driving in circles and found this place so I was not in the best of moods and I ordered it to go it's not like Hawaiian restaurants/chains around town have really thrilled me but it was packeand had awesome reviews so far. The staff  were very friendly pointing to the specials on the board which look interesting like a mahi-mahi  but I have my mind set on the short ribs and I got the teriyaki chicken 2 item combo basically for $12. 50 I got three of the better tasting and thick Short ribs I've ever had and some very tasty teriyaki chicken and rice along with some macaroni salad. Everything was delicious very hard for me to give any restaurant like this a five star, but at this place stays consistent l,  it might make it there. . So I went back for lunch and even better, the short ribs and furikake (sp?) chicken, wow now 5 stars","Fortunately this place has a broad menu. Do yourself a favor and go to Harlow's for Neopolitan-style pizza. . The pros: . Good location. Friendly service. Nice decor. The cons:. Bland pizza. Not sure how the rest of the menu is, but I didn't enjoy the pizza. I had the margherita. The crust was overcooked and flavorless. I felt like I was eating an inch-thick saltine. It left a cardboardy taste in my mouth. The sauce was mlegh. . The tomatoes were mlegh. . Everything was mlegh. .","I want to give a shout out to Ron the Mgr and his team at GAMEWORKS for the most excellent time we had at their establishment. Hawaiian Airlines recently had our holiday party held there on Jan 21st and it was the best party EVER!!! Ron made sure the party went on with no worries and no problems. Lets not forget their delicious food we ate Pizzas cheese and Meathead pizza's, kids favorite sliders, calamari, chicken tenders, chicken wings, and their chicken cobb salad and caesar salad was a hit with everyone. Our families enjoyed themselves and we definitely recommend any company or families who are looking for a place to hold their events at. This is the guy to see Mgr Ron Arenas at Gameworks at the Town Centre Mall","CIBO on 17th Ave has an extraordinary pizza bar and uber friendly attentive staff that makes you feel like you just stepped into a backyard party with unbelievably casual yet chic gourmet food. Always consistently top quality pizza with a heavenly crust that easily becomes my top addiction when dipped into that top secret caper garlic sauce dip that is Screaming MORE! MORE! And the staff to boot is incredibly customer service oriented, going out of their way to indulge any sweet/salty cravings you may have - and also treat you to tastings of the next up and coming experimental pizza in the works. How much do I simply LOVE CIBO? Well, dear, let me count the many pizza creations I've enjoyed and come back for over and over again. . . Just ask for the pizza maestros behind the bar --Kevin, Chance, Damien and Paul!!!","My fianc\u00e9 wanted pizza and burgers at ten at night and guess what!. . . . . THEY HAVE IT. . . . I cant stop ordering from this place the food is soooo good! I tried the pizza, calamari, the appetizer sampler, and burgers everything amazing three nights in a row now . . . the only bad thing is working out double time to burn off my addiction to this place! The burgers are amazing!","I was super excited to try Kaka since I've heard so many good things about the Markham location. However, everything went downhill as soon as we arrived for lunch. First off, there's no iPad ordering. You have to wait until a server stops by with their own iPad to take your order (literally the worst ordering system you can have for an AYCE style restaurant). This meant a lot of waiting since there was only 1 or 2 of them working the entire restaurant (which was about 80% full). We arrived at noon and an hour later, we were still starving. Food came out at an abysmally slow pace. By 1 PM, we got 5 or 6 dishes of the 15 we ordered. In total, of the 22 items we ordered, 9 never showed up. We put in our orders (4-5 items each time) 5 times and started to make bets about what would come out and which one they'd miss. We were also given wrong dishes as well. . It came to around $72 for two people but what was crazy was that the menu is also quite misleading. There are some items (such as the duck) that are not available for lunch, only dinner. However, you're still being charged the SAME PRICE regardless of when you go! Most places have a cheaper lunch menu since they don't offer everything, but Kaka is charging you full price regardless. The menu doesn't note which items are \"dinner only, \" and it was only after ordering the duck twice that the server finally went to ask the kitchen and was told it's not available for lunch. Some items were also not available, such as the sushi pizza and the Kaka ice cream. You're paying full priced for a stripped down menu. . Overall, the food ranges from decent to great, but it's so not worth the waiting, ordering issues, and being charged full price for a limited menu. Save your money and go elsewhere - there's no shortage of solid AYCE options in Toronto. Sadly after two hours, we left frustrated and still hungry. . P. S. Once you order dessert, they consider it \"final call\" and you won't be able to order anything else. This system is a bit strange and nonsensical, especially if you're with others and only one person wants dessert.","Second time ordering delivery from them. Last time we ordered and received our food we devoured it before I could take any photos of the food but this time I remembered so here they are. Notice we already snagged some pieces. Lol. We got the same thing as last time. Ordered the medium buffalo chicken pizza which is amazing. Nice leftovers for tomorrow. :) not overpowering on the buffalo flavoring and has a moderate spice to it. Decent amount of chicken pieces too. Not to saucy and just enough cheese. Lingering spice left on your lips. Also got the fried ravioli with marinara that is so tasty and the anti-pasta with extra meat. Definitely worth the extra $3. 00 for it. We got the large anti-pasta and it is usually enough for us to have leftovers for two nice salad lunches. It's  just the two of us. We live down the street which is nice so we actually received our order 10-15 minutes earlier than ETA. Definitely has been our first choice for pizza since we have tried them out. They have lots of other menu items as well such as chicken fingers, calzones , etc. . . you are not just limited to pizza.","I was randomly in Mesa with two people who also have no knowledge of Mesa. We ended up here and it was fine - but probably not the place we had in mind. . Red, White, and Brew is like a glorified Applebee's. Lots of families, lots of wood booths. Based off the name, I was hoping to be blown away by the beer selection, but it was pretty standard. . Maybe the real problem was that our server was a little odd. Very friendly, but odd. He stood a little too close, came over a little too often. One of the odder things was that he snatched my full glass of water because there was no ice in it anymore . . . that had been intentional - I don't like ice in my water and had been waiting for it to melt. Again, not ill-intentioned, but a little odd. . We ordered the pita pizza appetizer and it was cold - the cheese partially melted. Meh. The mains were all fine - but again, very comprable to an Applebees. . I don't live anywhere near here, but if I did - I wouldn't be back.","I was pretty excited to try out this place after seeing all the great reviews on here. We were a pretty big group of 12. The interior is very spacious. They didn't have an issue accommodating us all at one table. . As soon as we arrived we were served bread, olives and a really delicious dipping sauce made in-house. The server was very prompt at getting our drinks. . I ordered the Diavola (pizza with a tomato based sauce, spicy salami and mozarella). It took a while to get our pizzas since we were such a big group. The appetizers came pretty quickly though so we still had quite a bit of food. . The pizza was Neapolitan style. It tasted delicious but had a thick crust on the rims and was scarce on the salami. This seemed to be the case with all the other pizzas ordered by our group. I would rate the food 3. 5 for this reason. . Overall a pretty good joint to hang out. They charged us a modest 15% group gratuity.","Horrible customer service the guy that took my order didn't D. Have a apt number he knew I lived in a apt but never looked or asked for one so I assumed he has my full address . pizzas never showed up they called a cell number that was not working and never asked at the time of the order for a call back number. I called the store because the pizza never came instead of a sorry we will get it right out. . they kid said we can cancel the order. . No I want the order but stated the drive went back to the store a mile away lol. I called the driver his phone didn't work. . Nope never again!. Rude and can't figure out how to take a order","Solid! I am a pizza guy and I think its good stuff. I would give it a 4. 2","My boyfriend and I came on a Monday night for dinner after receiving a recommendation from a friend. It was 1/2 price bottles of wine (select bottles) so we tried the Ripasso which was great and only $23! (After the discount). We ordered a Large Arugula &amp; Parm Salad which was delicious and large enough that we both had good sized portions. We then split the Pancetta &amp; Potato White Pizza which was great. I ordered well done. Next time I'd ask for a little extra sauce on it as it was dry in sections. Overall it was delicious! Their oven gives the wood-fired finish without being soft or floppy in the middle of the pizza. Will definitely go back!","Very nice&amp;trendy ambiance. Family friendly. The wait was not long (10 minutes). . Napolitean pizza oven. . Good classic italian pizza (comparable to any pizzeria in Little Italy). . Good service. . No complaints.","This location has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Pizza Hut needs to retrain every single person at this location. You will end up waiting hours for your pizza and when you try and call to check on your order you will be put on hold for over 15-25 min. This place is beyond ridiculous. I'm livid with my 2 experiences with this place.","All I ordered was a small chicago style crust pizza. That is what this review is about. The place was very clean. I had time to look because it takes between 35-40 minutes to make and cook one of these crusts. There are 2 TVs, both on sports channels. Parking and access is easy off 40th Street or Bell Rd. The place is actually North of Bell Rd on 40th St. next to Walgreen's. It's across the street from the high school. . There were 3 empty tip jars on the counter and a place to tip on the receipt, but I only tip if there is wait service at the table, but if I have to walk to get a refill of my drink and walk to the counter to ask for a to-go box, that is not waiter service, and therefore no tipping. Sorry. Tipping here would be like tipping at burger king. . There is no nutrition information online or at the store, so if you are on a diet like I am, then I would assume the worst possible scenario. . Food quality was passing. It's a big cut above school cafeteria food, perhaps better than the cheap pizza chains like Domino's. But as a former Chicago resident and still a pizza snob, it's in the lower levels of compatibility with true Chicago Style. (In my opinion the standard for \"Chicago style\" is from Pizzaria Uno or Due). I lived in/near Chicago in the 1960s-70s and never heard of this chain. My brother has lived there all his life and told me he has been there and most of the people he knows would rate the chain a 4 on the 10 scale. So this place is like the Ponderosa of pizza chains. Somewhere above fast food but significantly below places like Pizzaria Uno or Malnati's. . Bad sign: I arrived there at 12:15pm and there was only one other person in the store, during the lunch rush hour. They may do a really good delivery business with the hospital across the street. . It cost me $21. 06 for a small drink and one small pizza. . Update: subsequent visits to this mall going to other stores, their parking lot is usually empty at lunch time - not a good sign.","Dear Vapiano, You're like a flighty ex lover. Each time I run into you I am taken by your beauty and charm and remember how tasty you are. But I can never figure you out and in the end I'm frustrated and down a few dollars.  . Ive been in 3 or 4 times in the last 3 or 4 years and each time I'm given a card to do what with now? Give it to someone and then bring it back? Nevermind I'll figure it out later. Then I walk towards the delicious smelling food and am immediately reminded why I haven't been here in a year. I have no idea how to actually get the food. There is just a mass of people (business is good!). Those people are smiling and happy and pleasant but they are just standing around. Its like I've wandering into a party thats been going on for some time where everyone is cooler and younger than me and I'm lost and confused. The pizza looks good, do i just muscle infront of everyone, do i just grab a pizza, do i order one? I honestly still don't know. So then i move towards the salads, but this is even more people just standing around. Then i move towards the pasta. Can't go wrong with pasta. I study the situation, ask a few people and it appears that you play innie meanie minnie moe and pick a chef.  then you stand behind a few people but directly infront of the chef and hope that sometime soon he or she will make eye contact to give you some hope that you are standing in the correct spot. They have never made eye contact with me. Then  i usually see a manager and beg for help. In the past the manager has spoken with the chef and directed the chef to take my order. If i make it this far, the food is prepared after too many questions and I do something with the card and have a nice meal.","I've never been to this location - previously had only been to the one in Chandler - but I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the west Valley. The food was amazing - I had a bacon calzone that was STUFFED with cheese and then cannolis for desert - and the service was excellent. They say give about 30 minutes for a calzone because they bake it fresh and to-order but I got mine in about 15. The waitress put in the wrong sauce - they ordered a white pizza, got a normal one - so the waitress gave them the messed up pizza and cannolis for free but got the ordered pizza to come out promptly in no time at all. NYPD has the best pizza I could hope for from a chain!","I've been to multiple locations and never had such a bad experience. It was lunch and this was the slowest I've ever seen an oregano's. . We came in for lunch on my boyfriend's birthday. They got my order wrong and my boyfriend's big beef sandwich was absolutely inedible. It was so greasy, I tried to drain it off but it just soaked through the napkin. It was so greasy you could squeeze it and grease poured out of it. I tried to get our servers attention more than once to alert her of our issues, but she never came around. Finally, we were so hungry that we had to split my sandwich I didn't order. I overheard our server comp the table behind us a pizza cookie who were also celebrating a birthday. We ended up paying for a whole meal we didn't eat. I will never come back to this location.","The service was terrible. I ordered a Margherita Pizza for 3 people and was told that you would pay after eating. The pizza was not bad, but when the check came the pizza was $30!  This was  I think a 12 slice pizza. Totally overpriced. The menu is very hard to read and so you have no idea how much anything will cost until you already eat it. OVERPRICED!  I live nearby and will be taking my business to the many other pizza shops in Squirrel Hill.","When I first came up to the place, there was hardly anybody in the parking lot. So I decided not to try it the first time. The second time we came in, we decided to try it and thank goodness we did! Luckily for me and my wife, we live by the mantra you don't know until you try. . The bruschetta was excellent, the crab cakes were fantastic. . . pesto crab cakes to be exact. Then came my pizza, it was delicious! My wife decided to get the chicken sandwich and it was juicy on a sesame seed bun. . If you decide to go out to eat, try this place and don't judge it by the parking lot.","We've ordered from them several times-both delivery and pick up. Their pizza is very solid and they have stuffed crust! I prefer a heartier sauce that is actually seasoned and theirs definitely delivers. Delivery times have always been accurate. They are our go to because we know they are consistently good.","Well. . as the say goes, you've got to try everything twice (just to make sure you didn't like it the first time). We've tried this place 8 times since moving to Laveen (both dine in and take out) and I hate to say they have only been marginal at the dine in. Every take out experience has been poor. From incorrect orders to incomplete orders to just plain poor service. Tonight, I hate to say, was their last chance with us and they failed. Ordered a to go order. Was told 20 min. Arrived 25 min after placing the order (we live 5 min away). Order wasn't ready. Had to wait an additional 25 minutes (45 min total for a take out pizza) and then the the order was both incomplete and cold. This tells me it sat in the back for a period of time before it was brought ought.  . This reeks of either incompetence by the front cashier or plain vindictiveness. Either way you've lost $150-200 a month revenue from this customer. At least with the competition the product is delivered warm.","Average pizza and sandwiches. Nothing great but nothing horrible either. Overall, their pizza just lacks any defining flavor. With that said, it's probably the best pizza place within walking distance of my home but there are several better places that are a short drive away.","I came here on a Monday night around 6:30 and it wasn't too crowded, but they did have a lot of online/mobile orders to get through before mine. . FOOD: I tried the custom pizza (unlimited toppings for $14), but this pizza is really a double ended sword. To get your money's worth, you would want to load up on toppings but this decreases the quality of the pizza. Too many toppings makes the crust lose its weight and become soggy. Less toppings (especially less of the watery toppings) make the pizza taste better, but not worth the price. One thing I did like is the wide range of cheeses - from mozzarella, cheddar, feta to smoked provolone and fior di latte. . ATMOSPHERE: The interior was more of a fast food looking restaurant where you can choose your own table once you order your food. HOWEVER, the winner of the atmosphere is their pie oven. This oven is a cute stoned dome shape and makes the business look a lot more authentic compared to its competitors. . Overall, I think I would come here again just to give this place one more shot and to find that sweet spot of the double ended sword.","We've been driving past this place ever since moving and it was time to finally stop in and find out what a place called \"Spicy Pickle\" actually serves. . Turns out it's subs, paninis, salads and little pizza-esque creations and the verdict is this is some tasty stuff. The italian panini was great. Very flavorful and a decent sized portion. . It's good to have one more place close to home that I know I'll be happy with. Looking forward to trying out some of the other menu options.","I'm not really a sheesha guy. In fact, I don't even know what it is but I see everyone else puffing on it when I come here for lunch. So, I guess it must be good here if you like that sort of thing. . I like food. The pizza is great. I've tried a couple kinds and they are always good. I think it's the crust. . Typically I order either the Hot or Cold Mezza to start and sometimes both. These are big enough for a meal so plan on sharing or don't order a meal. . The Med Salad is always fresh and has a real tangy dressing. Kind of a vinaigrette and it goes great with the chicken and donair meat in the salad. . If your in the area, you should try this place.","First, I am not from the East Valley. Second, Josh K's review is the most ridiculous thing I've ever read. He must be trying to get something for free out of Joe's or he has NO taste for food. With that said. . . . This is quite possibly my favorite restaurant anywhere. The BBQ chicken pizza is awesome. The Bleu Bacon BBQ burger is the single best hamburger I've ever eaten. The BBQ sauce with the bleu cheese is SO good. Their BBQ chicken salad is phenomenal. And, if you come for breakfast, their blueberry pancakes will knock your socks off!!!. I can not recommend this place more highly, you will not be disappointed.","Great pizza place for anyone new to Madison or just visiting. Besides having delicious pizza, the service there is superb. A few times I have ordered online in order to use a coupon and the coupon did not work. Without question, they accommodated me!  I always give praise for great service and this is no different. They deserve every star just for service alone. Enjoy your pizza!!","Mostly everything here was delicious! We came with a big group and tried a lot of things off the menu. My personal favorites were the tuna pizza, tuna tacos, spicy tuna rice cakes, baked eggplant and the hot mess roll. I have to admit that the other sushi rolls were not very good. I don't know how you can mess up a simple spicy tuna cut roll or salmon cut roll but they did. . . very surprising!! Go for the appetizers and shares plates not the cut rolls.","I ordered delivery and didn't have to wait long. I tried the Greek gyro and pastitsio. The food was decent, maybe a little bland though. I was happy with what I got, it's a nice change from delivery pizza.","Cool little bar close to home. Usually just order to go but the one time I did go in it took the guy 15 mins to bring my drink, he was super sweet and have it to me for free so all is forgiven. Food was hot and ready quick. The pizza here is really good, I like the just cheese best.","3. 5 stars. This place is the restaurant equivalence of a nineteen year old girl who just returned home from her Study Abroad program in Paris -- a little affected and confused in her attempt to appear continental, but somehow charming nonetheless. . Paris 66 has some things going for it: a convenient location, a solid, reasonably priced menu, and some reliably good dishes. . The onion soup is satisfying -- very hot, cheesy, with a strong flavored broth. The quiche is pretty good, according to my dining companion, as is the duck breast salad (decent quality greens; zippy deviled eggs, ok duck though a bit dry, could have used some dressing). I also liked their puff-pastrifization of the pizza -- a good idea that I'm going to steal and try doing it myself at home. I was not wild about my salmon and leek crepe (\"La Champs Elysees\" [sic]); Crepes Parisiennes does its salmon crepes better. This version is too dry; and their preparation somehow made the tastes of the salmon and the leek mixture incompatible. At least we ended on a good note with a tasty, flaky almond galette. . The service is friendly for the most part[*], but as other reviewers have pointed out, they tend to lay it on a bit thick with the \"bonjours. \" Similarly, the interior decor is a Disney caricature of a Parisian cafe: popular fin-de-siecle posters; an art deco metro sign; vintage post cards; etc. The affectation doesn't bother me very much; I find its inauthenticity endearing, kind of like a high school French club. . [*] Once, I did get a waiter who would not make eye contacts with me and would only speak to my dining companion. Doesn't seem fair to blame his bizarre behavior on the restaurant though. . .","At here twice while visiting for a conference. Nothing more convenient than the walk up slice counter. About $6 for a slice of pizza is totally reasonable in Vegas. I can't remember the name of it, but the one with the mushrooms was pretty good. The mushrooms were fresh and they kept them large enough to really taste. . The calamari was solid but nothing too spectacular. The the fennel salad was perfectly dressed to avoid too much dressing and there wasn't much fennel taste (which I actually prefer).","Friendly service, showed us the best offer to get more for less money. pizza was great. I have my found my new go-to pizza place.","Crisp is a gem! You will not find better. Adrian and Bona have created a pizza paradise! From the OO flour and the extensive curing of the dough to the sauce (so good you could drink) and best cheeses. . . mozzarella and pecorino, you have the foundation of the best pizza you will find. . . and we've been to the nationally recognized pizzerias in New Haven, New York and Chicago. I grew up on my grandma's pizza and she would be proud of what Crisp has done. Congratulations!","Ordered a pizza on July 4th. Called the order in and was advised was ordering through a third party company. Order was received and even got a call when my order was done. Pizza was very good, got their famous deep dish and the crust was perfect and pizza was tasty. We recommend this place.","The staff here don't use gloves to prepare the food here! I would be cautious bringing your children here to eat we will not be coming back here. . When I asked the staff as to why they were not using gloves they said that they didn't have to wear them. When I spoke to the manager Theresa she also said they didn't have to use gloves only moving from one place to another but I clearly saw a staff eating food In the back then going back to cutting pizza with no gloves. The staff were rude and laughing when I brought this to there attention I will be contacting someone higher up!","Place is a little pricey for the size of pizza. But quality makes its worth coming back","Never heard of jets pizza before. Went in and they gave me a free slice. It was delicious. I ordered an 8 corner yesterday, very good as well. Try the turbo crust","The last 2 pizzas I got were Burnt they tasted bad won't be going back the barmaid is not a pizza maker","The pizza was really good. It has really good flavor. The only disappointment was the wings. I thought they would be more crispy but they weren't crispy at all and the flavor wasn't very good. But I'll definitely be back for pizza.","Amazing food and customer service!. Server Mario take care of us with with great service! And cheff Oscar was really helpful with our questions on the menu !. We tried the prosciutto with melon and Brussels sprouts. Really tasty, highly recommended!! Their chicken wing come with blue cheese sauce is good as well. . We also order two different kinds of oven pizza, farm house pizza and Calabrese pizza. Love the farm house pizza with the egg on the top.","The food here is so amazing!! My husband and I loved it. We had the pepperoni pizza and Chicago dog. They were a lot bigger then what we expect, so definitely enough food. The pizza was sooo amazing! We were not disappointed at all. We sat outside which had a nice view of the strip. The waiters were really nice as well.","It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. . . I'll explain:. I went to Mediterrano when it first opened a few years ago, and the experience was mind-blowing!  In the vast ethnic food-desert that is Pittsburgh, Mediterrano offered REALLY good authentic Greek cuisine, New York good. I told all my friends about it, it was amazing. I remember paying about $40 for my wife and me, and thinking that I would have paid double. . Fast forward a few years:. I went back, and had the most mediocre Greek food. . . really it was terrible. We were told that the normal chef was sick, and that someone was filling in. Reluctantly, we paid the bill (prices had gone up), and said we would go back when the normal chef returned. . Next time, we ordered in. We spent $100, and got what looked like $40 worth of food. . . and it wasn't great. The food was generally lacking substance and flavor. Most upsettingly, it was a really bad value. . A Groupon came up, so we decided to give it another shot. We ordered Gyros, just Gyros:  they were very good. They're not the best I've ever had, but definitely solid. I thought perhaps they had figured out whatever was wrong. . Tonight, we went again. . . and this will likely be the last time. The waitress insisted that we had to order 4 entrees to fulfill the Groupon (which it didn't specify), and wouldn't let us use a gift certificate in addition to the Groupon (which is against policy I think). Our bill was $80 before tip. We ordered:. Spanikopita ($7):  We received 2 soggy little triangles of spanikopita. Still, this was the highlight of the meal. . . it was all downhill from here. . Lamb Gyro and Eggplant Gyro platters ($12 ea):  Greek salad was inedibly sour. The french fries were somehow both burned, and cold. The Gyros themselves were fine, not spectacular. . Lamb pasta (dinner special, $24):  The portion was small and it wasn't very good. The lamb tasted fine, but there wasn't much of it. The past and sauce I could have made better at home. I can't post pictures, but do the posted pictures look like $25 dishes to you?!. Brisket Pizza:  I've had this one before, it wasn't bad. Tonight, it was burnt and falling apart!  They must have messed up the crust, as the pizza couldn't be picked up without falling apart (I've never had this experience with pizza). . . It's so sad. This was an AMAZING restaurant, now below average quality and very expensive. I think that as video killed the radio star; Groupon killed the great authentic ethnic restaurant.","I ordered from #1 Brother's to try it again. They are back on their game. The pizza was hot, cheese was melty, and it is just plain good. So happy the last time was just an one off mistake. Thank goodness. My husband was about to ban us from this place.  . Love the think pizza and crust.","I'll have to agree with the other reviewers raving about the service at Enzo Pizzabar. It is unusually warm and pleasant in an area of the city known for aloofness and cool-as-a-cucumber attitude. Pizza was delivered hot and fresh out of the oven with a nice tender crust and zesty tomato sauce along with tasty cheese spread randomly over the pie. Topped off with a hearty tiramisu it made for a satisfying visit and we will be back! (gotta try the Oreo cookie pizza. . . )","Anthony G was a great server! . Our first time here in AZ. My husband loved this place when living in Chicago over 15 years ago. We planned on coming when the grand opening was happening but unfortunately we didn't make it. Anyway for our first visit it was a great. . We had the Classic pizza and the sampler appetizer while waiting. Anthony recommended the 312 beer which I never had. . . . great choice with pizza by the way. . Thanks and we will be back!","Darn you fresca!  Your service is always meh, but your marherita here is so good!. They are thin, sometimes I wish I could polish two slices but afterwards the garlic basil aftertaste gives me pizza regret. . Still, I love you!","ordered from this place a couple of pizza's for work on a Saturday, was very happy to have the delivery come very quickly. this hot pizza was very flavorful and the crest/dough was very light. everything about this pizza was absolutely awesome, but this location did mess up on cutting the party sized pizza. they managed to cut the pizza up and down, but not left to right. would definitely order again from them, as the flavors were outstanding!","Mint Hill needed another good place to grab a bite to eat! I've stopped in here a few times now. I've got to say, the meatball parm is fantastic! Nice crusty sub roll that gets baked in the pizza oven which also helps melt the mozzarella cheese. The meatballs(great flavor) are cut up into pieces so they are more manageable and the marinara sauce is kind of chunky w/ tomatoes. I guess that's what you get when everything is homemade. It's affordable too. $7. 00 gets you the meatball parm, chips &amp; a pickle. Not bad for lunch. I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu.","With Groupon in hand, we brought a friend for his birthday. We ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza, spicy chicken wings and some sodas. The manager was very accommodating with allowing us to get just about anything we want instead of sticking to the Groupon strictly, although we ended up just getting what was on the Groupon. . Service was fast and friendly. While we were there, a delivery customer came in to complain about her order from a few days prior and the staff handled her in a friendly and upfront manner and she seemed to leave feeling appeased. . Our food was ok. The pizza wasn't anything remarkable, but it was tasty. The wings had good flavor of Frank's Red Hot sauce. The chicken was plump and meaty. The only negative was that a few of the wings were a little undercooked and we avoided eating the ones that were a little pink in the center. . Overall, we had a good dining experience.","I've been getting delivery from this restaurant for as long as I've lived at my current apartment in Mesa, AZ (over a year) and I've really loved the food and the delivery driver's service. Tonight stood out for me, though. I've been having a really bad week, so I decided to order a pizza this evening so I wouldn't have to bother making dinner. When the delivery driver showed up, she was just a ball of sunshine. So friendly and smiling.  (Plus, I was delighted to see a girl doing this job, as I myself have been a girl delivery driver for many years, so I have a deep respect for girls who do it. )  Her smile and genuine friendliness made my day 100% better. Thanks for making my day, and delivering the best thin crust pizza, ever!","Don't believe the negative ratings. Go, eat and be your own judge. The food was great (we had wood fired pizza), the service and atmosphere, excellent. Outdoor seating on a beautiful October evening. Great dinner entertainment by Scott Hallock who did covers of soft rock hits from the sixties and seventies. A bonus. We'll be back for sure.","Try superbiotic pizza with daiya cheeze! It's my fav vegan pizza!","This is a review for brunch at Lil'Baci. I've had a regular pizza meal on their patio before and it was a better experience than brunch. . To start, we had an awful experience just sitting down at the restaurant. When we arrived, no one acknowledged us for a few minutes. So we stood waiting for a table. While standing there, another couple came in and immediately sat down at the last window table by the front. I was SHOCKED! Do people really just walk in and sit down? Especially when someone is obviously ahead of them and waiting? Were we wrong to wait to be seated?. The server saw what happened, came over and said \"Oh no! I was just going to seat you there\" and then looked stunned and unsure what to do next. Luckily, there was another table at the back of the restaurant, so we sat there. . Fine, OK, one incident due to a rude customer, which is not the restaurant's fault. . But the service IS the restaurant's fault. We waited over 20 minutes for coffee. Our water glasses sat empty until my SO eventually got up to signal for some. They weren't THAT busy, and at least someone could have checked on us. We felt ignored. . Food: I ordered the most breakfast-like pizza, with pancetta, arugula and a fried egg. The egg was over cooked, so it didn't have the anticipated \"gooey\" factor I was thinking would happen with a full egg on the pizza. My SO ordered the truffled scrambled eggs: nice that they were so generous with the truffle oil, but as you can guess, it was too much of a good thing. All you could taste was overpowering truffle. He didn't finish his meal. . Underwhelming food experience combined with an awful long wait and servers who pretty much ignored us: I'll eat somewhere else for brunch next time.","So finally saw this place opened and decided to give it a try. I ordered through the ritual app but by the time I got there they were just starting my order. Which was fine since I actually picked other extra ingredients to add to my custom pizza. The concept is pretty good as you can get unlimited toppings though the price reflects that too at $13 a custom pizza. The baking was actually faster than I thought and within minute my pizza is ready! The environment is open and clean but I decided to eat outside since the weather is great. As for the pizza I think the dough and toppings and their house tomato sauce is pretty good balance and taste good. I would come again but since it is pretty filling this is what I would do. . . . Tips: get a colleague and custom it half / half and share the pizza.","The pizza and subs are excellent but I usually stray from the \"lunch specials\" because they are too expensive to be considered specials. . You just can't charge a customer $11. 00 for a handful of tater tots and four bites of chicken. Also why is white meat more expensive? That's tacky.","Good pizza, love the online ordering. Placed our order while driving in a couple counties out. It was ready when we arrived. Didn't have any coupons but was still given a discount at purchase. Saved me three bucks  Much appreciated! They've filled the void of Village Inn and Papa Dels on the West Side.","First time back since the demise of Nicastros. Had pizza and Jumbalaya. Both were great. Service and food were good. Hope they draw better than Nicastros. Menu is much improved.","This place is under new management and I can tell, the pizza has gotten way better the staff is pretty friendly. It appears that the manager of cora's now works there at papa ceo, and is an owner!, so we should expect very good pizzas.","Pizza tastes and looks just like Little Caesars except it is $17 more. We kept giving this place a chance because my wife loves the pasta but everything tastes like garbage. I've ordered the philly, the roast beef and meatball subs and of which were subpar. So I figured I'd try the pizza, after all it should be New York style and how could they screw that up? Well they did and now I'm officially done.","Not impressed. Deep dish bottom crust was uncooked. Waited along time before being waited on. Price for small deep dish $35. 00. Could have purchased a really good pizza from Dominos at a third of the cost. Will we return. NO","This is truly an inspiration of Italian culture. As an Italian I was pleased with nearly every dish ordered and I embrace this very different menu. Pizza is ok but not great and having been here many times I notice most people are scared off from the very strange and different offerings and order pizza and pasta which I assume customers are playing safe.","Good place to eat. I liked the pizza and the chicken wings! Good family meal deal. This is better quality then Papa Johns, Pizza Hut or Dominos","I really like Bites and Brews. The name says it all!  The beer selection is great, with lots on tap. The pizzas are also great, and you can get them just the way you want it. It can get very busy during the evenings and during any sort of sporting event - but never is too bad that I'd avoid it. Sometimes it's just tough to sit down, that's all. Definitely give this place a try!","Already been here twice in two weeks. Pizza is very good. Especially the crust. . . . Service is friendly and prompt. Clean dining area and the special was a good deal at 12. 95 for a large pizza and two salads. . We will be back often. . . SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS!!","I absolutely love this pizza. This is my comparison place when I try other places and I'm still saying Nello's is better. I've never had a bad pizza here. Their thin crust pizza is the best and they don't overdo the sauce, so you can still taste the bread of the pizza. Of course the staff is always friendly. Bonus part is being able to have a good red wine here with the pizza. Yum.","I went here with some friends for lunch and considering the fact that it's an AYCE restaurant, I have to say the food was pretty good, but the service was just okay. If you go, make sure to order the mango sushi rolls and beef skewers. Be careful of the sushi pizza because it's either a hit or a miss, the first time we ordered it was okay but the second time it tasted oddly sweet/sugary. Also be careful if you order ramen because it tastes just like making instant noodles at home ((except more bland)). . I found that the ordering process was very confusing. If you don't specify how many sushi rolls or (for example) pieces of sushi pizza you want, they only give you one. The menu doesn't say how many pieces come with your order, so you would assume that they'll give you a bunch . . . but no. You have to tell them exactly how many pieces you want. . We also found that the kitchen would get our orders mixed up sometimes and not give us enough of something and we would have to request more.","This is a new restaurant in the Old Town area. I tried it recently, and I thought the food was really good. All of the pizzas are square in size, either a pan or as a slice size. The prices are reasonable considering the quality of the bread. I enjoyed it. I would highly recommend it if you are hungry!","Our initial impression walking in the door was good,  but things got worse from there,  hummus sampler, 3 kinds ,  should never be ordered, it contains a strange potato hummus that we swear had turned sour, but was told by the chef that its supposed to be like that.  the dolmades were hard , small slightly burned on the botttom and crumbly and dry inside, never order these!  the sausage pizza was a huge dissappointment, just about the worst tasting , worst crust pizza we have ever tasted, i say tasted because we didnt eat it , the dogs did. that item should not be on the menu! what makes it worse is that when you walkin you see a wood fired oven, well the pizza doesnt come out of that oven, i thinkits just for show!!!   other food we ordered was bland and not worth the calories.   look to the frozen food section in giant eagle for good greek food in the burg. . .    as for the other reviews of this rest. ,  we depended on them to try this place,  please dont sugarcoat this average food.","Cheap, decent pizza? 2am and stomach growling? LITTLE NIPPER'S. . There really isn't much more to say. Little Nipper's has been there for me every time and the staff is both speedy and courteous. Last week, I walked from East Carson to Craig (partially barefoot, because I made the idiotic decision to wear 5-in heels) and seeing the dimly lit 'OPEN' sign at 2:27am was salvation. I am forever yours, Little Nippers.","Came in looking to try out Aria's new casual pizza place. The concept had a lot of promise - a grab and go pizza joint located right next to the poker room, race &amp; sports book, and casino. I redeemed MyVegas rewards to get what was billed as a slice and a beer for about 10, 000 points. To redeem points,  you have to go to the mLife desk in the casino. The clerk gave me a $17 voucher good for whatever I wanted at Five50, which made me realize that a slice of pizza and a beer cost 17 dollars?!?!? . I ended up redeeming for two slices of pizza and a bottle of diet coke for $15. I got the Gotham and the Margherita - both were good, but nothing I'd clamor to return for. They set up some round tables off to the side near the entrance to the Sports Book for people who just want to grab a quick slice. Frankly, I still prefer the pizza over at the Cosmopolitan's secret pizza place more, but Five50 is a decent option within Aria.","This hotel has an excellent location on the strip which is probably the envy of many other hotels in Vegas. Do keep in mind that this hotel is one of the oldest hotels on the strip, but has recently undergone room renovations. If you decide to book here, my only advice is to reserve a GO Room. These rooms are newly renovated, modern and very high tech. Our room had a clean feel. There are many mixed reviews on this hotel. Partly because of the room selections that guests are choosing. I highly doubt you will be entirely dissatisfied with the GO Deluxe Room. After all, the bathroom mirror has a TV installed and the view of the strip is breathtaking. . A few other tips. . . The casino is wide open facing Las Vegas Blvd. so everyone passes through this casino while walking the strip. If security is a concern, look elsewhere. It was also a little strange because there was no security standing near elevators which I think this hotel needs. The timeshare people are super annoying so be prepared to ignore them all day, everyday. Also we made the mistake of grabbing Johnny Rockets as soon as we arrived and it cost us something like $40. 00 which is way overpriced for a food court. If you're looking for a snack, there is a pizza place, near the room elevators, that sells huge slices and margaritas for $5. 00 each. . This hotel is probably okay for all ages, but could potentially suit people on a budget looking for a great central location on the strip. Hubby had no luck winning on the machines, so gamble elsewhere. Customer service was nice. Housekeeping was friendly and always left extra toiletries. We had an A-okay stay at the Flamingo and would not hesitate to stay again.","I'm a FAN!  I'm not a big pizza eater, but THIS PLACE!! WOW!. Super yummy, not too expensive and the staff is friendly and fast!!. Thanks for making my lunch so much fun!","Nice place near ASU. Great pizza, full bar. Fast and friendly service. The only drawback is that they don't have desserts.","Decided to keep kids busy between basketball tournaments. This place is located in the back of Town Square. Plenty of parking and entry is in the front AND back. . Tables in the dining area were nearly empty. Service was still almost nonexistent! When the waitress did come by, she was very laissez faire. She took orders and some items never came. We were rarely checked on in the few hours there. We didn't get the bill until we asked for it. As infrequently as we got serviced, the waitress is lucky we are honest people! . Food is nothing to rave about. Typical quick fried and cooked food: burgers, fries, pizza, appetizers, salads. . . Plenty of tvs played sports. Plentynof tables for large groups. Side bar area for adults. . Game room is a bit stuffy. Games could be updated. One side room has a few bowling lanes. Another is dimly lit, quiet, and has computers for virtual game play. Kids loved it.","Sauce is a great gourmet pizza chain. I've eaten at the one at Glendale and 7th Street in Phoenix many times on several trips to the Valley, but stopped at the Waterfront location after some last minute Christmas shopping at Fashion Square (btw, Waterfront is really nice, first time I had been to it). It's very casual; you order at the counter after deciding from a menu on the wall. They have salads, sandwiches, thin crust pizzas, and pastas. I had the chicken pesto, tomato, and aged parmesan pizza. Their pizzas are very simple, with only a few ingredients, but there's a great variety of pizzas. After you order at the counter, they give you a number to put on your table and deliver your food when it is ready. The pizza I ordered was excellent. It had a simple taste to it, but it tasted really good. The only complaint I had about it was there could've been more pesto sauce. Overall, if you're looking for a quick convenient place to eat that has great food, head to Sauce. According to the website, there are 5 Valley locations, 3 Tucson area locations, and one Denver location. Now all they need is a Cleveland area location.","Ok, here's my update. . Went by for a large cheese and Calzone. I will not be going back again. . Pizza: Sauce was very watery; the amount of cheese they put on their pies is disgusting. The center of the pizza was simply inedible.     . Calzone: Nothing new to report. Not worth getting again. . All in all, I will not be back for pizza. It's just not NY style and not for me.","my friend who doesn't have yelp RELIGIOUSLY comes here on a weekly basis and kept telling me I had to check it out, I came here before a concert that was across the street (notice a pattern yet) and I was completely blown away. this place may look like nothing on the outside (no offence intended) but on the inside is what I would describe as a flavor palace. came here and ordered some panzorotti's as that is my go to when it comes to something pizza related. the food that came to the table was absolutely fantastic, and I absolutely love the olive oil station as well, kinda of a bit of a \"double dipping\" situation but it brought a certain richness to the food that was unparalleled in previous food experiences, . street parking is available but often times is seriously crowded, and the transit options are the 506 college street, and the 510 spadina with a bit of a walk. . the service is great, friendly and welcoming. the hours that they are open are also amazing. . would go out of my way to come back here.","Food is fantastic and the craft beer selection is the best in the east valley. We've been a few times already and have ordered pizza, meatballs, Italian meats panini and savory scones - all excellent! You can't beat their happy hours prices either!","Second time here. The pizza is really good. Not sure what they put in the dough to make it tastes so good and make it crunchy with the inside so soft. Looking at the rest of the menu I think I'm gonna be ordering lunch as well.","I would love to know what my $35 order of pizza tasted like but the driver was rude about the fact that he didn't have enough change. He spent 15 minutes arguing with me to discuss what policy was on the bill that I had instead of calling back to papa johns like I asked him at least 4 times, then he asked for the pizza back without handing me my money.","Absolutely loved! The service was great &amp; the margherita pizza was delicious! We also really liked the atmosphere. Very comfortable.","The place is outstanding!!  I stopped here with a friend from out of town and my two kids. We all ordered something different - pizza, mac n cheese, meatball sub and a roast beef sandwich. Everything was delicious - so much so, that we ended up sharing our meals. There were multiple mac n cheese options, so my 5 year old ordered \"normal mac n cheese. \"   We all loved it. The sandwiches were made with the same dough used for the pizza crust, which was amazing!  The pizza was among the best we have had in the valley (better than my two favorites: Oreganos and Spinatos)!!  My 7 year old enjoyed ordering his own personal pizza - you choose the crust, sauce, cheese and then any of other toppings you want. It was a fun place to eat and excellent service.","My bf and I stopped by here to grab a bite to eat since it's apparently the only place in the area open past 11. Atmosphere is pretty chill. The food was amazing and the beer selection was impressive. I got the bbq chicken pizza and loaded fries (just Ok). My boyfriend got the steak and cheese pizza which was amazing. . . Our waiter was nice but it was evident that he was ready to go home. Definitely would come back here. . Pay in cash if you can. . . I witnessed unsafe handling of credit cards. Waiter left a credit card on the table and walked away from it!  #Yikes","At first glance if you're not looking for Cafe Med you might miss it. Also it is best not to confuse this establishment with Cafe Medina across the street. Situated on 1st Street SW in between 10th and 11th Avenue. The general area is a little sketchy but I think it adds character to the experience itself. . Quick Tip: Twist the door handle to enter or you might find yourself standing there like a fool for a few minutes until you figure that out. . I haven't been to Cafe Med in a really long time actually so I thought it was a perfect excuse to visit and see what experiences I will have this time around with the Yelp crew. . Cafe Med has a very traditional interior with its basically reddish color scheme. Low benches and seats with pillows randomly placed everywhere. There is one or two tv's if thats your ting. One thing I could do without is the extremely loud music, it was so loud at times I thought I might be at some concert, front row, totally rocking out - you know? Or perhaps in an extreme belly dancing class who knows. . I ordered a Peach Italian Soda like I always do, it is actually quite delicious! You just need to remember to really mix up the syrup or you will have espresso shots of syrup each time you sip. . For food, I ordered the BBQ Schwarma Pizza which I thought was delicious. I would like to try out all the different kinds. I like the crust and how the pizza is made as well. I did feel guilty eating it like Tiffany and Sarah Louise were secretly judging me (probably were, just kidding, care bear stare!). We also ordered two Sheesha pipes as well, can't recall which flavors but I did enjoy them both and I thought it was cool that servers came around with fresh coals all the time. I hate changing the coals myself, feel like I'm gonna cause some kinda disturbance. . Lastly, my one suggestion for Cafe Med is pay better attention to their patrons. My friends are regulars there, I know what's up with everything and it doesn't matter who you are the level of service should be the same. Perhaps I'm spoiled with people always tending to me. Really though, when people pay separately you should keep track or else Angelo would have paid for a pipe that didn't exist. Also it would be fantastic to remember to bring back teapots with more hot water if you said you would take away them to replenish them. Aside from that I don't mind asking them again for people either. I want my friends to have a good experience as well. . Will be back of course!","Wow, what a great place and location!  We had the nachos (toppings put on in layers!) and shared a pizza. Food is excellent and wait service was perfect. . Take a few minutes and enjoy a cocktail downstairs in the vault area (very cool)!. Looking forward to many more meals at Lucille!","I had the pleasure trying an assortment of items. Mamajoun (topped with ground meat and spices), half and half cheese zaatar (herb) joun, red bell pepper joun and meat lovers pizza joun. For those who have never had a joun before, it tastes like a cross between naan and a thin crust pizza dough. The meat lovers was by far the best. On it is bacon, pepperoni and armenian sausage. What set it apart are the delicious spices that they use. I have no idea what they are, but they are delicious! The bf and I had lunch there for the first time and after finishing one meat lovers, we got a second one to go. . All the jouns (not the pizza jouns) have an option to be used as a wrap with fillings at no extra cost. The prices are pretty good too at $4 for a 10\" joun or $2. 50 for an 8\" joun! :) The meat lovers is the most expensive item at $10. . The bf and I have already been back once and plan to eat here many more times. :)","I used to visit Bannock for morning coffee or an occasional snack at lunch. The lunch is OK but the prices are fairly high, especially relative to the quality. The coffee is decent. . I went to Bannock for dinner for the first time and its ambiance is completely different. Among our table, a few of us ordered pizza (duck poutine), tofurkey burger, chicken pot pie, pasta with chorizo - a daily special, and the daily soup. We were all generally satisfied with our meals but none of us were particularly impressed, save for possibly the person who ordered the duck poutine pizza. . The service was great and we didn't have to wait too long for a table. Otherwise it was overall a fairly average meal.","Pros:. - it's on the strip great view from room. - fair prices for food. - food court inside hotel:. Johnny Rockets, subway, NY style pizza (by the slice) and Asian cuisine. . - good size rooms. - $5-$25 blackjack tables, nothing really high roller stat. - Walgreen about 2 hotels down. Cons:. - Elevators are old. - water pressure in rooms sucks ( your hose at home puts out more ). -  self parking sucks","We had a party of five and ordered four items: the guacamole starter plater, the mojo pork tacos, a flatbread Mediterranean pizza, and veg-fest Detroit-style deep dish pizza. The pork tacos were pretty good, but my husband has had better. We were all happy with the variety of food available to vegetarians, since the rest of us like to eat vegetarian. The chips were probably made from flour tortillas, so they didn't have the typical corn taste. The guacamole was good, but it was bitter (maybe a lot of lime), had very large chunks of avocado (larger than we liked), and was not plentiful enough to cover all the chips. The Mediterranean pizza had a wine taste (probably from the olives) that I was not a fan of at all, but the thin crust was excellent. The veg-fest pizza had deliciously fresh vegetables, and I loved the cheddar cheese baked crisp around the edge of the crust, but the thick crust was very bready. Overall the food was good, and is worth a visit. The waiter was ok, but it was very busy on the Sunday night we went, so he was not very attentive. Reservations HIGHLY recommended.","Our go-to bakery for the holidays and our weekly addiction at the Hudson or Howe Meadow Farmers' Markets. . Super fun holiday ordering process. . . they do an awesome job of keeping track of our small order and we now have a holiday tradition of getting 1 of each scone / muffin rather than 6 of one kind!. The Cranberry Walnut bread makes killer french toast or even bread pudding. . . on occasion I've even turned a loaf into stuffing. . Cookies and french bread are my husband's Saturday obsession. . . if he makes us late to either Farmers' Market and the french bread is gone. . . no cookies for him!. They also have pizza on Saturdays. . . great gourmet combinations but we never seem to get our act together to give it a try. We used to love Pizzeria Uno's baked potato appetizer pizza when we lived on the East coast. . . they have mashed potatoes as a topping option. . . with the weather turning cool. . . there is a carb night in on the horizon!. They are right next door to a Starbucks. . . so you can daisy chain your obsessions together or head up the street to First and Main and check out all of the other shopping / eating options in town if you are looking for an excuse to make the trip to Hudson. . They have an active Facebook page and post pictures of new creations. . Stop by a couple of weeks before Thanksgiving or Christmas. . . fill out an order form. . . and get ready for a great adventure! Just remember to come in early in the day if you want to try a variety of treats! Pastries are ready when they open at 7 AM. . . breads are ready by Noon.","Walked in and went straight to the bathroom to wash my hands. . . Completely empty with 5 employees behind the counter. No hello. Okay. . .  . Now I'm back to order pizza. They were training 2 maybe 3 young girls. The lady in front of me is making some crazy pizza and salad. It's totally throwing the trainees for a loop. Finally a manager steps in to help the trainees. And thankfully another helps me. Great!  I order a pesto chicken pizza. This is a standard pie for them. Super, he makes it and. . . then I wait while the lady in front continues her order and mass confusion. Why don't they throw my pizza in the oven? I find this odd.   . Finally I pay and wait. There are no knives only forks, watermelon tea is out with a cup placed over it. And the soda/ ice machine is spitting ice onto the floor. There are ripped pizza boxes on the floor and 1/3 of the tables are dirty. . . Ugh. I like the food at this place and usually they are efficient. But if they are training this way. . . It's not gonna get better.","This PTs Gold, is smokey and noisy, and crowded. If that is what you like then this one is for you. . We prefer to meet up with our friends for great food and conversation in a more calm atmosphere and less smelly/smokey. . We always just 2 blocks south on Eastern to PTs PUB. . that is far better. . They just don't advertise as much. . They are located just behind Village Pub, on Eastern and Sunridge Heights, kind of hidden, but a great place!!. They also have a Great pizza and happy hour special. . We can buy a pizza and 2 drinks for $13. 00 during 4pm and 7pm. . The waitress is a sweetheart, but bored, because it is so slow. . Come on PT PUB ON SUNRIDGE HEIGHTS &amp; EASTERN, advertise!!  Don't go out of business, we love you.","I have been getting pizza here for years. . For a very long time I got the same order. the price kept going up and up, but since we liked there food we paid it. So recently to save some money we changed our order from a large to a medium pizza. Our previous bill was about 41. 00. Doing this dropped our bill to about 32. 00 it then went to 34. oo dollars and last week and this week it went to 39. 00. My opinion. . . . they will do what ever it takes to get there hand in you pocket. When I asked why it went up 5. 00 they told me it was the delivery fee, when I said I paid 34. 00 last week with a delivery fee are you charging me 2 delivery fees. . . they changed it and said it was for the chicken nuggets. Well before we got 7-9 nuggets they said we can only get 6 or 12. . We ordered 12 . So 5 dollars for 3 nuggets. You lost us, our money and our respect. . I don't and won't recommend you to anyone anymore","The service I received was horrendous. There were only about 10 people (4 groups) in there and the bartender passed by me a dozen times taking care of everyone else. She didn't say hi or anything but definitely saw me. Two people came in after me and got served before I did. Then she took care of everyone who was already there making sure their drinks were full. At one point she checked her texts. At least fifteen minutes went by before she came over to me. Yea, she was a little busy, but not enough to excuse what happened. . After some people cleared out, I was able to get a little service. The food was pretty good and decently priced. I ordered the pepperoni roll and a personal cheesesteak pizza. The pizza wasn't bad, but the pizza roll was great. Unfortunately, the service ruined my experience. . I'd still recommend this place based on the food. Hopefully you'll get better treatment than I did.","This place is AMAZING! Service, food, wine, and staff! Best thing in fountain hills! We ordered pizza, pasta, wine, and one of every dessert. Blueberry cheese cake is fresh, light, and so tasty! You will not regret coming here! This is a MUST! We had our heart set on home made cream puffs, but they were sold out. . . so you know they're a hit! The owner is so sweet and genuine. She came to our table and made us feel like VIPs. Make sure you check this place out! Cheers!","Wetzels pretzels is my favorite pretzel shop. The real other competition comes auntie annes, which is a close second place for me. Wetzels has larger pretzels. I order the same thing everytime I go so I can only compare one type of pretzel: the almighty cinnamon sugar pretzel with caramel dipping sauce. Auntie annes has the same thing, just the diameter is smaller. . My friend likes auntie annes more but I like wetzels more, so it will depend on the individual. Like I said, the increased diameter of wetzels makes it delicious and more chewier, add in the dipping sauces and you're set. . I forgot to mention I did try the pizza pretzel but I think that is auntie annes so I will write a review about that later. Anyways, give this pretzel place a try if you want warm, thick, great tasting pretzels.","Got pizza for the first time. Looking for a new favorite pizza place. Not so much. Ordered a half pepperoni and mushroom. There was hardly any cheese on the pizza. It looked dry. Pizza tasted bland. Also ordered wings. Hardly any sauce on them. Did give us a lot of celery, though. The quest for great pizza is still on. Won't order here again.","Recently had my weekly craving for some major carbs after a week of clean eating. I went online and Dominos had a coupon for 3 medium 3 topping pizzas for $21. 99 which is a steal of a deal!  We ordered chicken and mushroom, hawaiian, and brooklyn pepperoni with shrooms and hot peppers. All 3 pizzas were cooked within 15 minutes and they were hot, fresh, and super delicious!!! . Dominos is my go to cheap pizza. I much prefer it over Pizza Pizza or Pizza Nova due to the fact that Dominos is always consistent, cheap, and they always get my order right.","This is a really cool bowling alley. Really cool!  There are plenty of big screen TVs with music blasting from the speakers, adding to your good time with friends. I've only been to Bowlero on Tuesday nights for their specials. On Tuesdays after 8pm they only charge $3. 33 (including shoes) per game.  $3. 33 that's less than $5 a game. Can't beat that!  The food is pretty good too. I've tried the pizza, flatbread, chicken tenders, fries, mozzarella sticks, and onion rings. Good greasy, fried eats :). I could be a little wrong with the pricing but the cheese and pepperoni flatbread cost about 5 or 6 dollars. There's only maybe a 50 cents difference in price for the pepperoni. However, the cost of a veggie flatbread could easily run you TWICE the price of a cheese flatbread. A few months back I ordered the veggie flatbread. The waitress asked, what kind of veggies would you like. I said onions, green peppers, and mushrooms. The waitress DID NOT tell me that there would be an individual cost for each individual vegetable. I'm sure the cost of the vegetables is way cheaper than pepperoni, or obviously not!  When I received my bill, it totaled almost 11 dollars for a veggie flatbread. A whole pizza pie cost $13 so the cost was ridiculous. Just an FYI . . . . Also, there's regular classic fries (delicious) and there's also a variety of flavored fries. There's salt and vinegar fries, garlic parmesan, and sour cream and onion. I've tried the classic, garlic parm and salt and vinegar. I love vinegar on my fries, especially when they're home style cut but the salt and vinegar flavor on their fries is soooooo overwhelming. We couldn't finish the serving. Overall, Bowlero is an awesome time, especially on a Tuesday night. Just think twice before ordering the flavored fries and do not order the veggie flatbread. It's not worth it!","Weve moved here from back east, and thought that we'd never find pizza we loved as much as back home!  Well, WE FOUNT IT AT UPPER CRUST!! Best Pizza I can remember having, crust was perfect, flavor was out of this world, and they even gave us a private area for a family party. Wish there was one in MY neighborhood :)","Surprisingly good pizza. Very busy so it's usually fresh! Lots of variety in slices available.","A minority opinion here: overpriced and overrated. Not bad, but this place would have been barely passable at 2/3 the price. . Service: slow and not responsive. . Drinks selection: wine adequate to barely ok, beer seriously subpar. . Food: . Apps: salumi plates allow no mix and match. So we ordered salami and prosciutto. Four slices of each, neither better than what you get at an average grocery store nowadays, $10 in total. Rip off. . Mains: ok pizza, average salad (endive and arugula). We didn't have a formal entree or pasta . . . and the price for Two people: almost a c-note. Much better - and cheaper - dining options in Cleve. . Decor was a little too \"not quite upscale new hotel. \" It won't age well.","Ordered a large pizza with Crushed Red Pepper Crust. Instead, I got my pizza with regular crust and crushed red pepper ALL OVER the pizza. I can tolerate this. The rest of my family ordered another meal from somewhere else. Follow directions or you lose customers. I doubt I'll be able to order from here again with how pissed off everyone was.","Homemade pizza and authentic to Arizona. A must try if in the area, something about the sauce always makes me keeping going back. They never shrimp on the toppings","Brand new food business!  They make you a pizza, you take it home and bake it. It's a create your own pizza place. . . As their name goes  Papa Murphy's \"Take N Bake!\"","Flour and Barley which appears to be a hip pizzeria nestled in the center of the new linq truly was a disappointment in terms of the quality of pizza and the service provided. . The decor of the restaurant is nice and trendy. An appeal of an \"upscale\" eerhem \"overpriced\" pizza place. There is seating inside or out depending on your preference and of course availability. . Service was cordial initially with the hostess but when we were seated our server really wasn't all that welcoming. Constantly approaching our table asking if we were ready when we literally picked up the menu. I did have an issue with nuts being in the pizza and asked if I could substitute that with spinach instead. Server asked the manager and approved of my request. . They don't provide bread but give out these measly pocky-like bread sticks. . The menu has two kinds of pizza. White garlic based and the standard marinara. We opted for the marinara pepperoni and spinach pizza. The pizza was so mediocre. Honestly the pizza tasted just like s'barros but with a $18 price tag. I also ordered some clam appetizer with breading which came with 6 clams I believe but were so tiny. . Overall, I would not return to this restaurant based on the server constantly bothering my dining experience and the poor quality of the pizza.","Amazing service! I had pre-ordered for the wrong time. Call the Morning of pickup and let them know what time I'd be in. Walked in at a minute till my pickup time and it was still cooking. Great fresh pizza, exactly as I ordered. Smiling customer service, friendly atmosphere, clean pickup. Thanks guys:))","Best pizza I have ever tried! The crust is super delicious. And their wings are on point, not too dry not to juicy. Def will be ordering take out from here!","Another update, they get upgraded to 4 stars since I have found myself virtually addicted to their vegan pizza and seasoned fries. . We ordered pizza for a work event and people would not get their damned cheese-eating paws off the cheeseless pizza that was ordered just for me. How good is that pizza? Well apparently SO GOOD that they kept eating that one, rather than the cheesy Greek-style pizza they had (also no meat).","good pizza and salad. I think they forgot about the salad the first time we went because it took a really long time and we had to ask for it. We made our way back again on another visit though and it was very good.","My favorite Italian place to eat at in Charlotte. The place is inviting and sexy. I love the pizza, pasta and salad! Great for a date, enjoy with a group of friends or a night out with the girls. I prefer to go mid-afternoon right before it gets busy for dinner. Enjoy with your favorite wine, beer or soft drink!","Over past three years when I've visited and sold wine, I've had the pleasure to dine here. Sorry no pics BUT. . . here is what I've ordered. . This crust pizzas, authentic New York thin crust style with an abundance of items and delicious sauce you'd think your grandmother made. . Meatball sandwiches which will fill you until the next day. . Salads which are fresh. . Garlic knot balls just like I've had in New York. . Great service. . Clean patio to dine. . Close to Costco where you can gas up the car. . Well. . . that's it. I've visited at least 8-10 times. . 5*****stars!!!","If I could give this place a zero rating I would! I was so hot walking around and wanted something good to eat and my family owns two pizza places so I love trying new pizza and the lady at the front was SO rude. Seemed annoyed was NOT helpful. I asked if there was any special and she literally shook her head and didn't even look at me. Way to help out people, specially tourists wanting to have a good experience. Didn't even order anything because of her attitude","Please order the burger. . . Please order the burger. . . . . You know there's a reason this place is call  Winghart's BURGER and Whiskey Bar!. Do you trust me or all these yelp reviews? I am begging you, the waitress is suggesting and your wife is pleading to you to order a burger. . . even one of the plain one. . .  . No. . . my travel mate insist on ordering a Pizza!! WTF! . As I ignoring him forcing himself trying to stuff that dried and burnt whole wheat like Sweet Georgia Brown Wood Fired Pizza ($9. 75) down his throat with a glass of water . . I just want to say you deserved that!. My Shipwreck Burger ($12) is just so so good!! My medium rare cooked patty is topped with brie cheese, caramelized onions with bacon, arugula, and white truffle aioli. Yes it is juicy. . it is cooked perfectly and it is worth every penny!. Sucker you! Stop looking at MY burger. . and stop asking me to help you eat your pizza. . . I rather have another pint of my kick ass Thirsty dog Siberian Night Stout with 9. 6% ABV! Trust me. . you don't want to mess with me after I have one of those! . Super friendly service!! . I will be back!! As there are 30 different drafts on tap. . . and I have not even start on the whiskey. . Maybe I should have order the WHISKEY! It is call a whiskey bar. . Fail!!","Great Place! I eat here all the time. Their crust is so good and I love the fact that I can put anything that I want on my pizza. Who wouldn't love that? The restaurant is always clean and the staff is always friendly. Plus they are super fast!. If you love pizza like I do, this is the place to go!","I live in the area and enjoy pizza and craft beer so I eat here about once a month. They have good pizza and beer and the service is good as well. The greasy slippery floor is a lawsuit waiting to happen so I hope they address this before someone really injures themself.","I went with a child and 2 other adults for dinner. The service was fantastic! Our waitress was friendly, efficient and attentive. She knew the food well and was able to answer all our questions. The food was either terrific or terrible. However, the good food more than made up for the bad food. We had to start the fried calamari which were soggy and overcooked but the ali-olio dip was fresh and tasty. The nachos with chilli was the BEST nachos we all ever had in our lifetime- how is it so good? Loaded with all the toppings! The deluxe pizza was disappointing at best - a paper thin crust with skimpy rancid toppings. The chicken wings were made fresh, never from frozen, were very \"meaty\" and cooked to perfection with the prefect amount of sauce. There is a half page of the menu dedicated to all the sauces available. We had honey garlic and The Dragon (honey garlic and teriyaki). My child wanted to create his own combo, which the chef was able to accommodate and the chef made the best cheeseburger ever (fresh housemade burgers), chicken fingers and salad were good. The coffee was brewed fresh and the desserts were amazing. We shared the gluten-free almond torte and chocolate lava  cake (which were excellent), the chocolate  was so rich and moist.","me and my friend's go to this pizza place when we want pizza either delivery or carry out. friendly staff, never had a bad pizza, though I duno how high my standards are for pizza, I just know that I hate pizza pizza.","CDI (as those familiar with Canada Drive-In call the place) used to be our fave and we crossed the threshold of this eatery, eagerly, once a week and sometimes even twice a week. We enjoyed their subs, the brochettes, the poutine and fries and of course, the sublime pizza. But about a year ago, we were served the most terrible pizza ever. Whaaat?. We were surely their best customers! Not only were we shocked that the pizza was inedible but we were hurt that we'd been served such sludge. . Had we just become too familiar and therefore, the cooks knew we would return so why bother trying to make a great pizza? Or was it just a bad day? Whatever. . . we didn't return for months and now, I go just for a simple breakfast now and then. Too bad really - they lost great customers.","Bread for the sandwiches taste terrible, the pizza is awful, service sucks. If you see this place keep driving as a matter of fact try not to even look at it. It just ruins my appetite every time I do.","I don't usually review places everyone has been (ie: McDonald's) because you know what it's about and you either like it or you don't. . I left the following message below on the 7-11 facebook page so I figured I'd strike twice. . . this is more on the general 7-11 company regarding their app rollout with a week long of freebies. As I saw on their facebook page a lot of other disgruntled customers with 7-11 not honoring their highly publicized nationwide weeklong promotion. By the way, my lone compliment is that the place was clean inside, but those new dorito cheese snacks looked vomit gross as did the 5 hour old pizza slice. . Anyway, here was my experience and post to their facebook page:. The 7-11 at 3695 S. FT. APACHE RD, LAS VEGAS, Nevada, 89147 Is not honoring the week of freebies. I went in for m&amp;ms yesterday and they acted like they knew nothing of it. . . I went in there today since it's a block from my house on my ride home thinking it was just one employee who was oblivious yesterday to get cookies today and another employee acted like they had no idea. . . I showed them the app and everything. What a huge waste of time. I never ever go to 7-11 because you don't have premium gas like Chevron. . . and the week long promotion whose whole focus was to get me familiarized with the 7-11 app as well as other things 7-11 offers has backfired into me realizing that this is a very poorly organized company and can't even execute a roll out without annoying the very people your whole goal by doing the promotion was to obtain.","Just got Sofia pizza I was just wondering if they change the recipe the pizza just doesn't taste good anymore it was one of my best pizza in town but now it just taste awful","We found success in our search for good food in Pittsburgh. The pizza was very good. I like the way the crust was cooked:  rustic and slightly charred. The sauce was rich and the amount of cheese just right. I don't care for an overwhelming amount of cheese on my pizza. My son had a slice of the stuffed pizza which had sausage and other ingredients sitting between a top and bottom slice of pie and he really enjoyed it. . They have an extensive menu of pizza and sandwiches and this made me wish that I could spend more time in Pittsburgh to try other items. I also like the pay as you leave setup. And, one thing I really appreciated was the staff looking out for its customers by warning us that there was a meter maid outside the building giving tickets. .","This place served the best pizza I have ever tasted. I am from Niagara Falls and you just cannot get this kind of pizza there. Friendly staff made this experience one that I will remember. We will be back soon - you can count on that.","That SPO (sausage, peppers, and onions) pizza is bomb! (And I mean that in a good way) The sausage is so flavorful. . I've also had the Philly cheesesteak and the super Italian combo which I wasn't impressed with. They both lacked flavor. . They have good lunch specials that run from 10:30-4pm and a full bar.","I popped in here once for lunch last summer, on the recommendation of my nutrition professor. Our chat on carbs and training for races and triathlons led to \"you HAVE to go to the Bread Company!\" . Though this overly subtle carb stop doesn't have a sign (anymore?) on its exterior, it can be identified by the variety of wine bottles lining the window sills. There's a variety of sandwiches for the lunch hour, but I hit the Bread Company tonight, and my, do they swank it up for dinner. . Dim lights, plentiful menu of pasta-pizza-sandwich options, and extensive specials list, including tapas. Who knew?  . I had the roast beef sandwich, served atop roasted potatoes and a light salad. I think all of the sammies are served up open faced, so open your mouth, and get ready for a carbolicious meal.","Awesome!!!!!! Great truffle salami pizza, pig truffle and homemade meatball. Also oxtail macaroni and garlic bread.","3. 5 not a 4, but better than 3 :) . I have only been to the Horseshoe Buffet twice, once for lunch once for dinner. First time I was treated to a weekday lunch. I was pleasantly surprise at the buffets scale (this ain't no China Buffet here!)   I have never been to Vegas or any other casino buffet so I have no baseline for comparison, but trust me, its pretty long !!  Actually a bit too long for its own good as both times I sat at one extreme end, and its a hike to walk the length. This might not necessarily be a bad thing as you can eat, AND walk it off all in one trip :)  The lunch selection is supposed to be less than the dinner, I didn't even notice, it was overwhelming both times. The lunch is far less expensive than a dinner @$24.  we went around 7:30-8 pm on Sat night. We were seated right away, but not before being snapped at by the buffet police who I suppose was directing traffic in the hallway? There are two lines, one apparently is for \"through traffic\"  the other is for the buffet wait line until they can seat you. Come on people, even the BMV has a sign so you know where to stand (or not stand)  put one up, and I'll stand there. . The food selection is gut busting, you'll need to walk the line a couple of times to evaluate what you want more . . . . the prime rib, or turkey with gravy and stuffing . . . I had the prime rib . . . . very good with excellent selection of temperature (done-ness)  I like my meat slightly red and it was dead on perfect. There were some ends, and I sure wish I could have sank my teeth in those, but too salty for me but . I also had some shrimp, with fried rice and chicken, very good. The other half said the beans were good (she's a bean critic)  other than that, I didn't hear much from her aside from one slight comment, \"if this thing had sushi, it would be perfect\"   And I agree, but of course it would have to be good sushi !!  . There are MANY selections, from salads to Asian, from pizza to ice-cream . . . and the overall experience was nice, a bit much for a buffet ( based on dinner cost)  the food overall was good but not as hot as I would have liked it . I'm not sure if it was the due to the travel time  to walk the full length of the line, or low temp of the food to begin with ?. . Parking is the downtown killer  for me though . . . we lucked out and found a street spot, but if I had to pay $25 to park, I doubt if I would go back. I'm not gambler so getting parking perks is out. I can't understand how hard cities work to get you to come into the city, then make it as hard and expesive to park when you actually go there?? !! . . After the power-chow we walked around a bit to look at the casino. Its dressed up real nice for the holidays and is very clean and most employees are friendly and helpful. We strolled into the high-roller wing just in time to see a guy pushing hundreds into the $100 a pull slot machine !!   100 . . . 200. . . . 300. . . . as his VERY angry wife looked on while loudly voicing her disdain for him. We hung around long enough to see a few more hundred  slip through his fingers almost like they were evaporating.   (he left shortly afterward) . . NO KIDS . . . its a CASINO","Great table and bar service ! (Shout out to Sabrina and Mike). Our server was very accommodating and sweet. The manger also is very attentive. . Probably not the best place to go when you're trying to lay off the cheese BUT they will accommodate it! We asked for half-no cheese, traditional pizza and it was a no-brainer for them. . Pictured: 12\" TRADITIONAL PIZZA w/ ARTICHOKE, BLACK OLIVE, ITALIAN SAUSAGE, and MUSHROOMS ; . MEDITERRANEAN SALAD;. LIMONCELLO MARGARITA. . Great for lunch. The salad was very refreshing. Try the margarita!","Soggy pizza and very slow service. The place was full and it looked like there was one gentleman working the pizza oven. Would not go back. Pizza would have been great if it wasn't soggy because the flavours were wonderful. Unfortunately our waitress also had a bit of an attitude.","The atmosphere at the Tatam location is good but overall, we were disappointed. . The happy hour prices are good. . The pizzas were OK.  We had the Fennel Seed/Sausage, the Roasted Mushroom and the Goat Cheese pizzas. The crust is very good, but overall, all three were rather bland in taste. . The biggest disappointment is the price/serving size of the Calamari and the Ceasar Salad. For the $9. 00+ price, the size of the Calamari was about 1/3 of what you'd expect. For about $12. 00, the Ceasar salad was way too small (and we got the large size). Anywhere else, these two items would have been much larger. . Also, the Ceasar salad was very, very bland. Not much taste. . I've been to Humble Pie approximately, 8 times over the years, but I've become increasingly disappointed. . I most probably won't go back.","This place get's 4 stars. . Why?. 3 seems kind of Harsh. . . . Things I like about it:. It's great for lunch. . The pasta is the thing to get - its made from scratch on premise. . The price for the pasta (skipping the meat) is pretty good. . It's actually pretty fast. . Things I don't like:. The pizza. . . It takes too long and its not worth the cost or the wait. . The card system is a bit irritating. . The way they make you wait in line. . I would not recommend this place for dinner - unless its a weeknight and you know what you are buying. . Some facts about me:. I can't comment on the salad because I haven't tried it. . I have been here 3 times. 1st i tried the Pizza - then I switched to the pasta and haven't looked back. . I love home made pasta with any sort of fresh made from scratch sauce. . Cheers!","Yelp says Bites and Brews has closed, which isn't exactly true. . . It's still there, in the same location. However, everything decent about it has changed. They used to serve excellent pizza, sandwiches, and salads with create-your-own pencil and paper-style menus. Crumpled and DIRTY menus with a few sandwich options and tacos have replaced it. Our waitress told us that they haven't been serving pizza for five months.  . We had chicken quesadilla to start, which contained canned chicken (or something that they dredged in water?). Even though we explained that we were going to share, we didn't receive plates or napkins. The gross quesadilla was followed by tacos that were even worse. The \"fried chicken\" taco was a chicken finger cut in half on a flour tortilla, with a ranch and mayo sauce. The pulled pork taco (recommended by the waitress) was completely inedible. It tasted like it had been saturated in root beer and vinegar. It was also covered in a mayo-based \"sauce. \"  . Besides the disgusting food, the beer was slightly flat and didn't taste normal. I definitely won't be back. Too bad this place changed. . . . Go to Harris Grill instead if you're on Ellsworth. It's overpriced for the food quality, but at least it tastes good.","Barking Dogs is our favorite place to self-wash our dog!  The owners, Kathy and Craig, are extra nice and get to know you and your dog. They have a nice selection of everything in their store including fresh baked treats - our dog loves the pizza!  Be sure to bring your doggy in if you live near the area!","First and foremost, this isn't classic Chicago Style pizza. With that said, the pizza still isn't bad. Of course I think Girodano's, Malnati's, Gino's is all trash so take this as you will. I've been to this place three times now and I will say after my first visit (lunch buffet) was so so as far as i'm concerned. The salad was good though and who doesn't like a warm cookie as you leave? This led my wife and I to try it for dinner one evening. It was busy, around a 20 min wait for a table but it was worth it. We were given a bar table which allowed me scan the numerous brands of beer on tap-lots of micro brews which is great. We ordered the \"Chicago Style\" medium (plenty for three) and it came with plenty of cheese and lots of flavorful slightly spicy sauce. The crust was crispy yet tender inside, my preference. At any rate the service was prompt and competent. Overall I believe we'll definitely be heading back to this place as long as the beer keeps flowing and the pizza quality is up to snuff.","Best pizza, reminds me of New York! Best and freshest ingredients, fast and friendly service, my husband and I eat here as often as we can. Try it, you will make it your favorite just as we have.","Cedar (Sedar) Grove Pizza? Well, If you're hungry and in the area, sure! It's a pizza by the slice joint that will have 2 or 3 kinds of pizza on hand for pizza by the slice, as well as well as some Mediterranean food and takeout pizzas . The donair pizza seems like their thing - donair meat, topped with with fresh tomatoes and lettuce. By fresh I mostly mean not cooked, not over spectacular and crisp, but raw. They serve a bunch Mediterranean street food like donairs as well. There really doesn't seem to be much italian influence in this kind of pizzeria. Cedar Grove seems like one of Calgary's many street food style shops that seem to have a background in Mediterranean, but have decided to make pizza as well. Is it good though? Sure it is. The slices were under $3 a piece which makes them a pretty good bang for the buck. You'll probably want 2 slices for a lunch quantity of pizza. . The place is nothing out of the ordinary in the way it looks. it's moderately clean with moderately friendly people working there serving moderately good food. Go in. Order pizza. Get out. aaaaaand that's about it. If you're in the area and hungry for pizza. Sure, why not?","Ordered some pizza, stromboli, wings and salad. . At first i thought it had a good feel for a pizza place but as i waited for the food to come i noticed that the whole entire place was a hodge-podge of old pics to make me feel as if i were in some old italian eatery. . . . but i wasn't. . I was in a strip mall in suburban Las Vegas. . I was in strip mall getting \"decent\" pizza, an \"ok\" stromboli with a sauce that kinda tasted outa the can, wings that were fried to death and a weak salad. . All of this was fine to me. . . because you know what they say about pizza. . . even bad pizza is still good. . UNTIL THE BILL CAME. overpriced for the quality. I guess because this pizza place is in the land of chain restaurant hell means they can fool the average suburbanite into thinking that paying top dollar at a mom and pop place for \"italian food\" is ok. . well i guess you fooled me this time.","Fantastic pizza and salad. Good beer selection. Nice patio ambiance. Their house dressing is out of this world, and the whole wheat pizza crust is delicious! LOVE this place.","3. 5 Stars!. We were here on new year's eve. Nothing was open. It was snowing &amp; we were hungry. . The place looks clean &amp; the staff was friendly. We got the pepperoni pizza &amp; the poutine. The pepperoni pizza was just decent, nothing special. The poutine was pretty good, flavorful! . 2 slices of pepperoni pizza, 2 sodas, &amp; 1 poutine, all total we spent $12. 63.","D\u00e9licieuse pizzas . Mention sp\u00e9ciale pour la pizza artigiani!. Grand choix de vin. Tres bonne soir\u00e9e","The place is absolutely discusting and unsanitary. Bought loose sunflower seeds found a LIVE WORM when I got home. I went back and complained, however absolutely no care from staff. I got a shoulder shrug!!! Flies inside especially near the deli section where the mini pizzas are. Will never shop there again.","Ordered a large pizza. PAID FOR IT. Was told that the pizza would be ready in 15 minutes. 20 minutes later I was told that the person forgot to punch in the order. FORGOT!!! There was no explanation. I was given a dipping sauce as apology. I ve never seen such appalling service anywhere over Canada. Doesn't deserve even the 1 star. . HOW THE HELL DO YOU FORGET!??? That's what you do for a job for gods sake!!","Very good pizza! Overall best place to grab a quick bite to eat before a long night of partying.","Love the atmosphere is this place. I have been a few times and one of them being a bachelorette party celebration. It has great ambiance, service, and of course can't go wrong with any of their food. . I loved the al dente pasta and their pizza . Love this place for date nights it just gatherings. . It fits a decent amount of people with their large dining area that can accommodate big groups but also allows small intimate gatherings as well","Food is not bad. The deep dish pizza was not hot  and a little warm on the inside. I do like that it is very cheesy. I wish the pizza would have been hotter. The plates at the table were not clean so I had the waitress replace them. The next plates she gave were wet but we used them anyway. I prefer clean and dry plates. Calimari was pretty good. Bruschetta was too thick and tomatoes fall all over the place. Hot wings were good. I didn't want to complain too much and just ate the food. I might go back. I just hope things will be better.","Horrible. . . . we had the pizza, both regular and Sicilian, , steak sandwich and the ravioli. I'm from the border of pa &amp; nj , I know good pizza and steak sandwiches. this place isn't as good as a bad jersey pizza place or a bad real philly steak. .     not again for me. .","Took a pizza risk and decided to try this place despite poor reviews regarding service. Can't really say much about the pizza since we were never seated. After waiting for nearly 10 minutes without a server even looking at us, we patiently waited a little longer before we gave up. There are many pizza places in town so we decided to take our business elsewhere.","Have to say I've ordered from this place several times. The wings are DELICIOUS. The pizza was OK. Not enough sauce on there for my liking, but my husband absolutely loved it.","Worst place ever! Horrible customer service. The pizza took over 2 hours to get to our hotel and it was cold the mozzarella sticks were gross. NEVER AGAIN. Think before ordering from this place.","Did a quick take out order of one large pizza to try this place out because of the high reviews and I can say I wasn't disappointed!  The large pizza was only $9. 99 and we got three toppings on it; artichokes, spinach, and chicken. It was cooked and ready for us by the time we requested for over the phone. . The pizza itself was very well made with the ingredients being fresh. You wont be disappointed by the quality and taste of this pizza. And plus it's cheap and worth it!","Been here a couple times the food is always great, especially the New York thin crust pizza, but I love the atmosphere. Everyone here is so nice and welcoming every time I've gone. Great place to grab a bite!","Firewater is always an enjoyable experience. This is the second time I've been. The first was about a year ago, with about 50 people in the upper seating area. Not sure if it's changed, but the only issue was the Firewater Chicken. . . the chicken pieces were quite crispy, even a little burned. It seemed to be the same way for everyone that evening. . The latest visit was during a huge event that took up the entire venue. It was mostly standing room only, unless you managed to snag a table earlier in the evening. I had two pieces of a pizza that had chicken on it (to be honest, I have no idea what it's called on the menu) - it was divine! Due to the busy nature of the event, I had some issues ordering a drink, but the servers were managing the crowded event very well. . The atmosphere is cozy, the decorations are homey. Love Firewater. I will be back.","3. 5*  My review will be skewed 'cause I DIDN'T pay!  :)  I was with a bunch of colleagues for a \"Lunch &amp; Learn\". And we were in a separate room with at least 1 waiter available, so again, my experience was probably a bit better than if I had just gone on my own and paid. . Fanciest stuff for lunch were shrimp cocktail/mussels. I didn't eat the mussels, but the shrimp were HUGE!. As you all know, you can eat as much OR as little as you want. If you're paying your own way, you're probably gonna eat as much as possible.  (I didn't eat that much 'cause I was seated right in front of the guest speaker, so I couldn't exactly sneak out to grab food. Mental note for next time!)  Same goes for eating as \"healthy\" or as unhealthy at the Mandarin. . There are a lot of salad and lighter, non-carby options, so you don't need to stuff yourself to the brim with all chicken balls, lemon chicken, chicken fingers, fries, pizza, etc. !. Out of all the items that I selected, the only thing I really didn't like was the pasta with bacon pieces. Tasted like they added Cream of Mushroom soup to a red sauce. Not to my taste, but perhaps others will like it. . Not an awful experience, but again I was there for a work function.","We tried Lucille after walking by and seeing how cool it looked. Unfortunately, that cool look translates to horrendous acoustics - you could barely hear the person beside you, much less the person across from you. . The waitress was nice, though she inexplicably kept calling my husband Patrick - when she asked if that was his name, he answered \"no\" and she clearly couldn't hear him. . The food was good, though there is better pizza in town (Pizza Brutta, Salvatore's). The harvest salad was tasty. The Caesar salad had croutons so hard they were almost inedible. Overall, we decided we wouldn't be back.","Gluten-free review:. Came here with a group of friends for dinner on a Saturday night. We made a reservation but were seated late due to the party before us taking their sweet time leaving. The staff were very apologetic and friendly though, and since the place isn't very big they didn't have another table we could use. . I ended up getting the surf and turf dinner for two, with a glass of muscat wine. I shared it with another person and it was the perfect portion size. It was super delicious and I highly recommend it. Everything was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. My other menu options were the salads and the arctic char. I think there might have been a couple more items that were a gluten-free option but I didn't ask since I wasn't interested in them. I'm not sure if their pasta or pizza has a gluten-free option as I didn't ask. . The rest of my party ordered a variety of items and each loved their meals too. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. They also had no problems providing separate bills. Overall I have no complaints about this place. . TL;DR - really good food, several gluten-free options","Ambience - really cozy and casual, a great place to have a nice dinner &amp; be able to talk. Service - good!. Food - I'll start with the bad. They serve some pretty terrible bread as the starter. I mean, I get it's free, but you're an Italian restaurant, have some GOOD bread! It was stale, hard, and lacked flavour. Worse than day-old bread from grocery store!. I ordered the BUFALINA salad (roasted cherry tomatoes / balsamic reduction / bufala mozzarella arugola / basil / x-v oil $22) which was PARTLY disappointing. The bufala mozzarella was creamy, rich  &amp; delicious, BUT it was served atop way too much arugula, which sat on top of MORE of that stale sliced bread! . The entrees though, were SPECTACULAR. We were a group of 7 that ordered 4 pasta dishes, 2 pizzas, and 1 salmon entree that was on the daily special. We only disliked the one salmon dish which was bland, dry, and overcooked. But really, if you're going to an Italian restaurant, you really should be ordering pizza or pasta! Shame on them lol. . All of the pasta dishes were delightful - perfectly executed and FULL of flavour. We ordered the FUNGOCREMA, COMMENDATORE and PUTTENESCA. All great, but the first 2 were stand out dishes. The 4th pasta dish was a lasagna from the daily special which was top notch too!. Their pizza is also done really well. The crust is airy, but chewy, and perfectly crisp. . All in all, I'd highly recommend Mangia &amp; Bevi and will definitely be returning soon!","Great place, friendly service and very clean restaurant. You can custom Build you pizza for a great price with all fresh and natural ingredients. Even better is that your pizza only takes 2 that's right 2 minutes to cook in their wood fired brick oven. The all around pizza experience was great. Great tasting pizza. I highly recommend this place to all. You will enjoy.","I'm in the minority here. . . I didn't like it at all! Although I usually prefer my food on the rare side (we're talkin' blue rare steak, carpaccio of all kinds, tartare, an absolute sashimi fiend) - the mussels were undercooked, even for me. To the point where some of the mussels had that telltale 'still alive' consistency. Was at dinner with a girlfriend though, so didn't want to be gross and spit it out at the time. Of course, My stomach paid the price afterwards!! (Sorry B, will just have to go with my GUT instinct next time. Har har har). My dining companion ordered the pizza margarita, which she found dry and lacked toppings and commented she preferred the same pizza at O&amp;B's Canteen. The basil was also scarce - about two or three small leaves which were then torn into thirds to place atop five thin tomato slices. . On the plus side though, the service was excellent and waitstaff were friendly and ready with smiles, always eager to make recommendations or ask if you need anything more. Excellent crew!","My team came here last minute for the $20 lunch special and they were able to accommodate us which was very nice. The special consists of your choice of salad and a main (pasta or pizza). It was a really good deal for what you got and the portions were definitely generous. . I had the Cesar salad and the Fusilli chicken pasta. The salad was great but the chicken was a bit dry. It was obviously cooked separately and then added to the pasta so it hadn't absorbed any of the (very delicious!) flavour or creaminess of the sauce. That said, I'd definitely like to come back for another lunch or possibly dinner. My only other complaint was that we were a large group but they only brought out one serving a bread at a time. It wasn't even enough to everyone in our group to have a slice. C'mon!","I have dined at almost every single one of the restaurants in the O&amp;B chain and its a hit and miss. Bannock is bang on!. Nestled into The Bay at Queen and Bay - Bannock offers up delicious food at more than reasonable prices!. I brought William T. here for dinner prior to catching the opera, Rigoletto, at the Four Seasons Centre. . I love the wooden interior and the shelves, lined with pickled vegetables. When you first enter you will see the take-out counter but just a few steps further will take you into the dine-in area. . We ordered a Caesar and an H&amp;B cocktail. The best part of the Caesar is the piece of bacon at the end. . . Yes ladies and gentleman - bacon!  However I found the spiced rim was heavy on the salt!  The H&amp;B was by far my favorite - it was a. peachy cocktail. . We ordered 3 entrees to share. The Roast Duck Poutine was amazingly good! If you order nothing else order this! The flavor was so intense that I think it sort of numbed my taste buds and decreased enjoyment of the other 2 dishes. The duck was a bit scant but the gravy made this pizza delicioso!  The crust was nice and thin and the pizza came out piping hot. . The Side Ribs Burger was also very savory though the pork was not as tender. It was served with yam crisps. . The Pork Shoulder braised in onions and topped with a pear comport was tender and the pork just came off the fork. It was served atop a bed of spaetzle and spinach. The sweetness from the pears married well with the saltiness of the pork. . Unfortunately after having shared 3 mains we didn't have any room for dessert but after having experienced such great food I will definitely be back for some dessert!. The service here was excellent. The servers and wait staff were all very attentive and a \"so uppity it's scary\" kind of nice.  . The bill at the end of the day came to about $95 for 3 cocktails and 3 mains with tax and tip. It was money well-spent. Definite must-try and highly recommended!","Very friendly staff. A little expensive for a meal. Idk if the pizza is as expensive but my fettuccine Alfredo with chicken with a combo was $18! I thought okay this has to be amazing if it's this expensive. Wrong. I open my meal to see that my pasta looks like soup. I stirred it and let it sit for a few mins in hopes it would thicken but I was wrong. I took a few bites and threw it away. Highly upset that I could have made a better fettuccine Alfredo at home. The only reason I would go back is to try the pizza. . . maybe.","First off, I had a blast cause I was able to spend some quality time with my mom and son, which a rare lately  due to my crazy work schedule, with that said I was very very very disappointed in the customer service or just service in general. The place is very cute and cool, tons of tv's with tons of sports to watch. Nice and cool inside, and there wasn't many people when we went. Our server was not good at all. Kept forgetting about us. Forgetting to bring us things, small or big, she couldn't get it together. Now, just because I myself am a server and work in a restaurant doesn't mean I'm picking on her. She herself said to me 'am I ignoring you guys alot tonight?' ummmmmmmmm yeah!!!!!!!!! . The little game area was ok, although the machines kept taking my money and I  had to keep getting someone to fix it. Annoying!  . Food was ok too. Loved the house salad. My pizza kinda sucked, was suppose to be thick crust and was thin. We had to ask three times for more dressing. My mom ordered a wheat beer and she was brought ??? well it wasnt  wheat beer, so she ordered something else. Ten minutes later, still no beer. I finally had to get up fine the server and ask her to get the beer. . . . . . . . now!. We had fun just being together and watching the game and my son play. But, I wont be going back anytime soon. :(","Going back today to try a meatball sandwich. The pizza we got the other day was good so I figured I would try something else. It's a fancy  pizza shop that's it. The other poster said something about. $28 pizza. We got a lg pizza one topping and a pop and got out under $22 .","Came here on a week night for my sons 2nd birthday. It was so quiet and we basically had the whole place to ourselves. The staff were friendly upon our arrival. I think i paid $10 for my son to play for an hour. There was a variety of rides and gamea for all ages. They had food avaiable to order such as pizza and drinks. They had a security system where they put an invisible stamp on the adult that brings the child in so that child must leave with that adult. They use a flash light so only the staff and you can see. I also like how chuckie came out to dance with us. He gave us tickets ans high fives! We had a great time.","I am disappointed to say I wasn't blown away by wingharts. . Maybe I didn't order the right thing, but I overall felt it was pretty average and nothing that I want to hurry back to. . We went on a Sunday evening, it was pretty quiet there compared to a lot of the surrounding bars in the area (which I liked). The place is gorgeous, I have to say that. The unique abstract table tops and the painting around the door on the outside was all done by hand (I watched the guy paint some of it a couple months ago). It's dark, but comfortable at the bar and it's an overall chill atmosphere. . My boyfriend ordered a burger, I ordered a falafel sandwich as well as a BBQ chicken pizza to share. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger and was happy that \"it didn't fall apart at all\" but it didn't blow him away. My falafel sandwich was good but again, nothing fantastic and not something that I would order again. They are known for their brick oven pizzas so I had high expectations. The BBQ chicken pizza was good- thin, crispy crust and topped with Caramelized onions, chicken, sweet BBQ sauce and cheddar cheese. The BBQ sauce was a little overwhelming and took away the flavors of the onions, cheddar cheese and chicken though. . Their draft list wasn't bad at all, they have a pretty large selection of craft beers! . It was an overall enjoyable dinner, but nothing noteworthy. I would like to return to try their wings, but I won't rush back.","I am surprised that there is not a lot more local buzz for Pat Dees. The food is surprisingly good. My first visit to Pat Dees was when I needed to get some food to help the contents of my stomach from a recently completed pub run. So I was going to like about anything placed in front of me. A very nice French dip was a great choice. But I made sure to go back twice after that before forming an opinion. So after an awesome patty melt and above average pizza, here you go. Pat Dees is above average food, great portions, and amazing price. During happy hour, 3 22 oz. , and the afore mentioned patty melt, I got out of there for less than a 10 spot (not including tip). The only con of Pat Dees is the service is a bit slow. All three times I had to ask for a menu. . *disclaimer: It's very good bar food.","Ordered some pizza and fish sandwiches from here through their online ordering system. Placed my order at 1030am, it was easy to use and got a confirmation etc. The worst part is that the pizza was supposed to be here at 12pm but never showed up until 115pm. Everything was cold, pizza was all slammed to one side of the box and ice cold. Fish sandwiches were cold and the fries were just a big glob of grease. I would not order from here again for delivery ever.","My wife and I decided to try this place as we had driven by several times. I ordered the schnitzel sandwich and my wife ordered the State burger. They should rename the schnitzel sandwich \"The onion sandwich with schnitzel. There was some some schnitzel but there was a large red onion in the middle which made up most of the sandwich. Very disappointing. My wife's State burger was fantastic. The service was poor at best. Had to go up to the front desk to ask for a waitress for the bill. Finally another waitress got us a bill after we waited so long. They put us in the back behind the pizza bar, which did not get a lot of attention. Some of the waitresses made recommendations but ours did not. Not sure if we will go back or not.","Been wanting to visit this place for a while now and finally got the chance to swing by and get me a square slice. Have to say that I am glad I did. Was greeted right when I walked in, I believe it was Adrian the owner that was working the counter. Order two slices with Pepperoni and they tasted amazing. The crust was crispy and soft too, not sure what magic they used to do that but it was amazing. The sauce was good, not to much but not to little just the right amount. . I got it to go but once I got in the the car the smell overtook me and I ate it right there in the parking lot. Might of broke the 15 minute parking rule but it was worth it! I will for sure be going back again soon and highly suggest it to anyone that wants a tasty square slice of pizza.","My favorite pizza place in Rock Hill, way better than any other pizza place in the area. Great clean looking place, and nice staff. They also have awesome fried chicken and I always get an order of jojos. 100% recommend.","It's been a long time since I ordered Papa Johns, now I remember why. The pizza was bland and not that hot. However, the real problem was the service. I made a mistake and double ordered some bread, good thing it was far superior in taste to the pizza. I also ordered and paid for 10 pizza sauce side dippers and receive NONE. I also asked for 10 parmigian packets and received NONE. looks like I'll stick with the other Papa!","Foodwise, it was really good. I forgot the name of my pizza, but it has pepperoni and mozzarella, then I added grilled pineapple. Best decision I ever made. My bf ordered the penne alla vodka, also really tasty. Not out of this world, but solid. The only reason I down voted it was because the service was a little bleh. Our waters were never refilled and it took 30 minutes to bring the check. Maybe it was just an off night, I would come here again.","Amazing food. Puts Olive Garden to shame. Best salads, pasta and pizza. The servings are huge, so it's great for many people or for a couple to take leftovers home. It's old school setting with really cool decorations. The food and drinks are very well priced. I can't say enough good things about Oregano's.","Excellent deep dish pizza. Love the sauce and the abundance of cheese! The sampler is okay. Pretty small portion. The mozzarella triangles were the best part of the sampler. Service was great--our waitress even served us our first slice. I like Giordanos much more than Loumalnati's. I will be back. The bathrooms were clean and well stocked.","Ask for the thick crust and they will make you a fresh deep dish pizza that is amazing. The same dough is used on the cinnamon rolls and we were in heaven. Service, value, and cleanliness deserve 5 stars. Buffet selection is good but didn't see too many veggie options. I'm sure if I asked they would have though. Seniors got their drinks included.","Location is very central on the College/Little Italy strip. I made reservations through Yelp and didn't have a problem when I arrived. Love when I see that option on a resto's Yelp profile!  . A table outside on the ground floor patio was ready for our party of five. Our request for the rooftop patio wasn't possible because it was shut down due to it being too hot and the roof itself needed tending (?). Regardless, the ground floor patio was fine and the weather was cooperating until we paid the bill. I've been to Vivoli before but I remember the salads to be heartier and a bit larger in size and the pizzas to be less dry. My children had the margherita pizza and they said it was ok and my pizza was more of a rustic type without tomato sauce or mozzarella and I found it to be on the dry side. The pitcher of red sangria helped moisten the palate. Overall, it was a decent meal and I am sure I will return but not anytime soon.","Everything is made fresh. Pasta and Panini are good, but at M&amp;B it is ALL about the pizza. I would say that it is truly incredible. Terroni and Il Fornello pizza cannot compare to M&amp;B. My two favorite pizza's are Burina and the Patta &amp; Pancetta. Pizza this good is an art and takes a bit more time. It is absolutely worth the wait. Lunch is very busy, so call ahead for a reservation and especially if you are going between 12- 1 PM. They are also open evenings and weekends. Much quieter and great for a romantic dinner. .

Reservations &amp; Take-out: 416-203-1635","I'm not the biggest fan of Italian so it definitely surprised me that I liked Buca as much as I did. This definitely isn't the cheesy, saucy, gooey Italian food that is so unappealing to me. This food was fresh, lively, and flavourful without relying on gooey, melted cheese and way too much sauce. . We tried a couple of their pizzas. They were both excellent. The margarita was quite fresh and delicate tasting. We had a charcuterie board and the salamis were all delicious. . We shared some pasta: the carbonara and one with a ros\u00e9 sauce (I don't remember what it was exactly since I didn't do the ordering). I thought I'd prefer the carbonara, but I actually preferred the one with the ros\u00e9. I don't think they separated the egg all that cleanly on our pasta and I detected some of the white in taste and texture. It wasn't that pleasant, especially since the yolk was so large (goose egg) so it cooled down the pasta considerably and that made the presence of the bit of white all that more off-putting. . Service was really seamless and efficient. . If you're going to go Italian, this is the way to do it. Maybe just avoid the carbonara and go for a different pasta instead.","Great food. Been coming here for years. Some of the best pizza in Cleveland. Casual atmosphere with great prices on beverages and food. Patio is nice in the summer for a family.","Amazing Pizza . . . . Wonderful  customer service food quality great reasonable price for the best pizza place in town","My cousin works here and that's the only reason i know about this place. The crust they use for the bread is so light and airy and i absolutely love it. It makes the eating experience that much more enjoyable. . I always order a slice or two with sausage and mushrooms because I love the little crumbly sausage that they add to the pizza. Plus if you dip it in ranch (big fattie) it taste even better. . I took the hubby there just this week and he agreed that it is very good. They have tons of specials and even more menu options. We ordered the medium pie and 12\" hoagie for only $13. Really good deal and the italian hoagie was not too bad. I do wish however that it was a little thicker. Maybe add some more lettuce and tomatoes for fullness. By the time we got it home it was like eating a lunch meat sandwich. Still delicious but I would have like a little more bite in my hoagie. . The interior is a little outdated but they have a bunch of steeler memorabilia hanging up. Also, if you like to play the lottery they have a small window for buying and playing the numbers. Waste of money if you ask me but to each his own. . BTW, IT'S CASH ONLY HERE, but they do have an ATM.","This is really a solid place, depending on what you're looking for. . . . Food? Great choice! There's Pizza Rock that serves great selections of both pizza and beer (even some rare ones every now and then). There's Borracha that serves great Mexican food, Bottiglia for great Italian food. . . . . Entertainment? This is one of our go to movie theaters. Not big gamblers but I did play craps here once and it was fun, dealers were chill and cool guys. Haven't been to the other bars or played table games, honestly if I was looking to just gamble I'd probably brace the strip but all the people I see playing seem to be enjoying themselves. . If you're local it's really worth stopping in and checking out.","Gator's was the best. The place that went in after Gator's was not good. This place is better than that place, so I'm happy. . Nothing really notably good or bad about the place. . They do have pretty darn good pizza, which pushes it from a 3 star to a 4 star. The wings were ok. The bartender/server was friendly and attentive.  . I'll go back.","We were staying Aria and looking for a casual bite on a late Sunday night to take back to the room. Five50 Pizza to the rescue. It was almost closing time but the gentleman at the counter was super cool and even boxed up our 4 slices in the big pizza box. We went with 2 slices of Gotham (pepperoni, salami, sausage, mozzarella and grana padano) and 2 slices of Forager (white sauce, mushrooms, bacon, whipped ricotta &amp; spinach). Both pizza types were good and definitely hit the spot. The slices are big and the crust is great. Great flavor combinations, the both of them. Re-heated in their wood burning pizza oven at just the right temperature and length. We really enjoyed it. . We stay at City Center often so we will definitely have to try and have a sit-down meal at Five50 next time. Located inside Aria Hotel right before the sports book. Very busy area of the casino so you may think all they sell is pizza. But they have a full menu of Italian fare.","What a pleasant surprise! Walking around the Mirage looking for a more \"healthy\" option and this was amazing. Service was great, from the hostess to the waiters. Food is superb. I used to travel to Italy for work and I can say this is very decent. We had the Branzino which was perfectly filleted, Margherita pizza and the Caccio e Peppe. . . wow. . Will definitely be back!","Visited here twice. Once on a lunch run and second time for a dinner with friends. I really. The first visit I ordered and shared one of the pizzas (forgot which one but it had porschiutto) and the bolognese with lemon ricotta. The pizza was ok, but nothing to write home about. It is a hefty portion though so definitely can be shared with a friend for a light lunch. The bolognese though was the highlight in my mind. I thought the lemon ricotta complemented the bolognese really well and offset the heavy/greasy feeling one often gets from eating a bolognese. . Since I enjoyed my lunch, I returned for dinner and ordered a stuffed meatball and spaghetti and ate off some of my friend's fresh mozarella which I am told is made in house. The mozarella was fantastic in my limited cheese knowledge, because I can actually taste the strong flavour of the milk that the cheese was made from. That plus toast and the tomato jelly was a great combo. . The stuffed meatball and spaghetti was ok. The meatball on it's own was great, but I think their bolognese just set a really high standard for me in terms of the pasta. It was probably the ricotta that made the difference for me. My friend also got a chicken parm. It was pretty ordinary, I recommend sticking to their specialties (ie. pasta + pizza) instead. . Price wise, standard downtown price. For those on a student budget may be save up to reward yourself after exam seasons. Or come during winter/summerlicious.","4. 5 stars!. It was a pizza kind of night and I was like I wanted to try Custom Built Pizza for some dinner. . . . so we did and it was great!. Of course we had to get it to go as its easier that way so I wrote down what I wanted and off my husband went to pick it up. It was a Saturday night and there was no line! They just took my post it note and made up my pizza (half Alfredo, half pesto with roasted chicken, Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella and artichokes!) . My pizza was delicious although next time I might try to do Alfredo and pesto together and I want spinach on my pizza! I think it's a super cool concept and the fact that they don't charge you per topping rocks too! I do wish their crust was a lil thicker since I felt like my pizza toppings slid right off but it was still tasty. My husband told me the pizza cooks really quickly which is good to know when they have a food rush. Definitely a huge bonus that they give LVAC members a discount! . Will I be back?! Heck yes!","Soooo I tend to be stingy with my 5 star reviews but this place deserves more than that. We've been here a couple times to play laser tag and although it's a bit expensive we have always had fun. Since the laser tag/bounce place closed in our part of town and moved way too far south for us we've been trying to figure out where to host my sons birthday. I called this place and they were so friendly and accommodating. They didn't have all these crazy parent releases you have to sign and they allow outside f &amp; b for party's. They even have customizable invitations on their website that you can print out. Seriously?! I was sold. We had a private party room, 2 games of laser tag, pizza and bottled water. The pizza was dominoes which we like so thumbs up there. The party room was clean and ready with plates napkins and cups. They can even lock up gifts and the party room if parents want to play laser tag (we did!). Our party host was Peyton who was fantastic!  She greeted us immediately and stayed through the whole event making my kids feel special and ensuring the birthday boy was the center of attention. They wear a headset that is on loud speaker and can announce all games and activities so that the party is always in the right spot. We brought in juices, cake and balloons which she took great care with. They have goody bags you can buy and they are awesome! Way better than I anticipated. My boys played with all the stuff in them all day after party. I'm an event planner and who ever trained these kids working here did a great job. Every one of them was fun, professional seemed to love their job. This is my go to place for parties, very impressed. Thanks Laser Quest team!!!  You made my sons day!!!","First let me say, my experience over all here was an absolute 5 star. . ~The food ~. Oh my gosh, where to start? We ordered the eggplant bake (not sure its name) and cesar salad to start, followed by a couple of beers. Cesar salad was amazing, but small . . The beer was light and crisp just how I like it. . For our main dish he ordered the brocollini pizza and I the spaghetti with clams. He said the pizza wasn't anything special (but then again he eats pizza from all over Toronto about 2-3 times a week. It's crazy!) I thought it was very bland, I have made better pizza's myself from scratch. Broccolini was a good idea though! I thought the pasta was a little over done, but for once a perfect portion size. I ATE EVERY BITE! :D. The reason why I am giving this restaurant a 4 star rating is due to the flavours/quality of the main dishes. Usually they are outstanding when you go to a pricier place for a meal however this restaurant (which I'm assuming is new) needs to put a little more love into their mains. . After they placed down the main dishes we got our own bottle to use of freshly made olive oil. I LOVED their home made olive oil! It was delicious and tasted magnificent on the crust of the pizza we had ordered. Some dishes they were carrying out from the kitchen were massive in size! Exciting!! . For dessert we split the nutella brownie. It was to die for. I wish we got our own! . ~The Service~. There were only two women serving the whole restaurant that night. Both were super nice and not overly fake! (lol I hate when servers try so hard and are super fake-happy-over the top energetic) Food came quickly with no delay and hardly any wait time. The waitresses were knowledgeable, helpful and polite. . ~The Atmosphere~. Very romantic, sensual, dim lit atmosphere. Perfect for a couple to go for date night. ~Overall~. Quaint little restaurant I would advise anyone to go for a quiet evening with someone they love. . ~Prices~. Our bill was about $100. 00 which isn't too bad for a restaurant of this calibur for two people!","The wings and pizza are amazing. Wish we could've tipped the cooks instead of server. \"Lean\" was our server, not good service. Our drinks were empty for a long time, she didn't come by to check on us often. On my way to the bathroom all of the female servers were sitting at a table eating when they could be checking on tables. . Also bathroom has major leak, very gross. We had to get up and ask for things several times. Been to this location 4 times and service has not changed.","Ambiance and service were fine. Pricing was acceptable considering the location. I'm a little baffled by all the positive reviews of the pizza quality. Ordered the Gotham and frankly didn't enjoy a single bite of it, nor did anyone else in our party. Extremely dry as it lacked any kind of pizza sauce at all really. Lacked flavor as well. Just wasn't very good frankly. For a \"Pizza Bar\" that touts a James Beard award winning chef, how is your pizza not above average at a minimum?","I came here with my family just last week we ordered the 10. 99 larger cheese special this is by far the best pizza I had in las vegas the pasta we also order was fresh the service was phenomenal it was a nice sit down place for my family and I to enjoy dinner and football !!!","I love N. Y. style pizza. Could eat it every day. On a recent to trip to Pittsburgh I tried alot of pizza and this was good pizza.  . One thing about Pitt pizza. . . it is slightly different than true NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese. As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce. The sum of its parts is still a delicious close cousin to NYC pizza. . The pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of favorites:. Fiori's. Pizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch). Pizza Perfectta. Aiello's (Murray Street). Beto's. Save for Beto's, I thought they were all delicious. Wish I had a chance to try Mineo's. A Pittsburgh native friend of mine calls this his favorite but they were closed July 5th when I went by their place on Murray. . . I'll try them next time I'm in the 'burgh. . \"Cuts\" (Pittsburgh speak for \"slices\") are small but they are also priced a little cheaper than the average pizza place. There's seating in the back if you're not taking out.","My husband, the kids and I went here to try something new. We are fans of basic (gyro, kabobs, pita etc) Mediterranean food. They gave is free pita bread with olive oil and spices, when we first sat down. The kids meals are only $4. 25. They have a choice of cheese pizza, chicken nuggets or a hamburger. I had the gyro platter which is an \"assemble your own\" gyro with spicy potatoes. I got a lot of meat which was crispy around the edges and tender. We had the calamari as an appetizer. It was tender and had a light breading on it. I could have had that as my main meal. My husband had chicken and spicy potatoes. Our meals were very tasty and the service was great. We will definitely go back again!","NOT GOOD PIZZA. ordered a large cheese pizza and a house salad. Pizza was hardly large, no flavor, rubbery crust, hard cheese and sauce was bland. Literally it was like gas station pizza or something, little ceasars is better, and that not saying much. House salad was literally only lettuce and a little chopped tomato, ranch was def like Kraft or something not homemade and disgusting. Will never order again. Even my 9 year old complained and said it wasn't any good. On the flip side, ordered through postmates and it was on time.","So this is probably the best pizza I've ever had!!! We ordered the Skinny and the BBQ Chicken, so freaking good. Although, idk that I would call it Chicago style, having had Giordano's, but it's definitely good. Looking to go back!","If you are looking for a genuinely cozy warm spot that has great inexpensive italian food . . Amelia's pizzeria is a must go to place. This place definately deserves 5 stars. Service was super friendly and warm. The resto itself is small but great for a date night, family supper night or friends supper. Decor is lovely and feels homey. Now for the food. . I must say there pizza was truly delicious!  Sauce and ingredients were fresh and tasty. This resto is also a byow which makes the whole experience awesome!  Most important. . . leave room for dessert. . . . they have one of the best tiramisu's in the city!  Truly delicious and irresistible!!! Great for sharing! Will definately go back!","I live in Agritopia, so I am a very frequent patron of Joe's Farm Grill. The Fontina burger is my fav, and the veggie pizza is my husbands fave. My only 2 gripes are that the place is always packed. The best time to go is about an hour before closing. By that time the line has died down. The second thing is the flies . . . but given that the place sits on a FARM, there's not much that can be done about that. We usually sit inside to avoid the flying critters. Overall a wonderful, family friendly place to eat. Supporting local is my thing, so I love that!","Really nice gyro. Soft, fresh pita bread, warmed and nicely browned. Spicy and plentiful meat. Tangy yogurt sauce and quick service. Great, quick and inexpensive late night snack. So good I'd return for lunch.  . At a place clearly in business for its' pizza prowess, don't overlook the fantastic gyro.","I had takeout from this paramount but it was really good! I had the chicken with cheese manakeesh and it was absolutely amazing. . . it's like a medditarian pizza. . . I truly enjoyed the crispness of the flatbread and there was the perfect amount of cheese on it as well.","Love living near the Clifton Martini &amp; Wine Bar. . The outdoor patio is wonderful in the summertime! A warm night with a glass of wine or creative martini makes for a good evening. The location is perfect as well. Nestled in a brick apartment building surround by residential homes and sitting nicely on Clifton Ave which after 8pm quiets down considerably. . The interior has a nice modern look and feel. Wooden bar and black, metal furnishings. As Will said below, sophisticated and subtly romantic. . They have delicious wines and martinis and beers. A very good variety by my standards which some consider slightly above average. Food is where my strong point lies. I love their menu here. It is simple, it is elegant, and it is tasty! . For the life of me--I cannot remember what I had there recently. I want to say Crab Cakes which I split with a friend. And on another occasion before I had shared a tomato basil pizza. . I'll just have to go back and write a proper review by actually ordering an entire meal to myself.","Well I just have to say that I will NEVER order pizza or wings from this place. My sister ordered 2 pizzas and 50 wings from this place and had it delivered. First it took over an hour to get there only to be given some wings that had already been eaten with the bones still in the box! When she called to talk to the manager their excuse was \"the cook was eating and we probably boxed and delivered his wings\". Excuse me but why in the heck is the cook eating where the food is being prepared!!! Serious sanitation violation.","Very nice place great noodles but the pizza was ok. The pizza made me feel a little uneasy but overall decent place buttered noodles are actually like the scoops and not the long noodle but not bad.","Went here to sample the deep dish pizza, and it was excellent! One of the better deep dishes in town, the 12\" runs only 15 bucks plus toppings and feeds 3+. Also had an unspectacular Caesar salad and run-of-the mill hot wings. Good beer specials (domestic bottles 1. 50) on Thursday nights. Service was good (even though Melanie was the only server on our visit). I'll return, mainly for that deep dish deliciousness. . . . . .","If you are looking for a trustworthy mechanic at optimal price, this is your place. Gene's Auto is actually owned or managed by Mark, one of the kindest people and most interesting characters I have met since moving to Cleveland. The place is a hidden gem, no sign, no advertising - you can find it on the 5 point corner of Euclid Heights Blvd, Overlook, and Edgehill in Cleveland Heights. These guys are hardworking and honest. Mark has walked over to my home numerous times to help with car emergencies and has also picked up and dropped off my car. He even drove it to get my echeck for me once. He has fixed minor problems for me repeatedly for no charge, and has always let me know his pricing up front, which has always been under estimates given elsewhere. Urban legend has it that he once fixed the car of a young man on the skids in exchange for a pepperoni pizza (so said the brother of the guy I bought my daughter's bunkbeds from on Craigslist). When my friend was visiting last year over the holidays from out of state, we were hit head on by a drunk driver on New Year's Eve - the car was totaled but drivable - we found Mark working very early on New Year's Day, and he checked the car for safety, bolted down the damage, and waved my friend away with no charge, wishing him a safe drive home. Mark is an unsung hero, and there are endless stories of his generous and kind spirit. He's a very knowledgeable mechanic, can fix ANYTHING, and his guys are also wonderful. I would trust Mark in any situation - he's a true salt of the earth kind of guy.","Ordered pick up. Place was empty, but looked nice. They didn't have a kids menu so ordered a small pizza and an order of spaghetti. I got a deep dish pizza. All was tasty, but costly. I plan to go back, just not in the near future.","Good stuff. I was in town for a couple days on business and decided to try SoHo.  My boss and I stopped in on a Tuesday to grab a bite to eat and have a drink or three. I had the \"SoHo chicken florentine\" and my gluttenous superior ordered an entire chicken Alfredo pizza. We both pigged out.  4 stars for so-so service. Worth it, though.","Do not go here if you want some pizza and a cup of water. They charge you for A CUP of water. I couldn't believe how rude their staff was. I had to have my male friend ask for napkins because the women didn't even acknowledge me. Most sexist place I've ever visited. I don't even know why I keep visiting the most worst places on Yelp. Do not EVER VISIT THIS PLACE. Unless you speak Spanish, the associates only tended to the people who spoke Spanish. Unless you were a man, then the helped you. I will be spreading the word on not to come here. I would not even give 1 star.","My 24 year old niece was in town visiting so we wandered around the 'hood looking for a vegetarian option for her. Lots of hamburgers, not a lot of veggies. After reading a few menus on windows, we decided Lil' Baci looked warm and inviting and went in. . I'm so glad we did. The food was tasty - I had pizza, she had spaghetti - and the atmosphere was just as it had looked - warm, inviting, cozy, fun. It got a bit loud at the end of our dinner (around 9 pm) but I like loud. It allows you to have intimate conversations about sex and breakups and boys and worries without the certainty that the quiet couple next to you is listening to every word.  . And yah, at the beginning of the night there were a lot of families with small children but there wasn't any shreaking or screaming or loud parent admonishments. Instead, it seemed communal and lovely. . I've read a couple of reviews about the 'too friendly' service and I have to disagree. Our server - Justin - helped make the night a great one for us by being engaging, flirty and fun. If women can put on 'the shine' and spread compliments like hot butter on breakfast toast for tips, why not men? Bring it on, Justin.  . Altogether, a great way to spend the night in the neighbourhood.","Nice resort, great location!  I had a free night here thanks to some company incentive and I really enjoyed it. The staff is very attentive and nice, but I thought the rooms were just okay. . What I did really enjoy was the pool!  It was awesome. . . very clean and kept up well, and the staff out there is on the ball. They seriously have a new drink in your hand just as you're slurping up your last drop of bloody mary. Now that's what I call service!  Plus, they'll bring you towels if you need them and you can even order food out there. J. A. is right, the pizza is great!. All in all, this is a nice resort, and the location is perfect if you want to experience the Scottsdale nightlife.","I went there for dinner a week after they opened. . . what can I say?! I am Italian born and raised and It was just like being back in my beautiful country!!! Just in one of those little trattoria that are so common in Italy! The food is to die for! ( you have to try also the sfogliatella!! Wow!!!) great pizza too and the owners from Sicily add a really Italian style atmosphere and style to the whole package!! A++++++ you have to try, I will go back for sure.","Great Gyros, chicken, and gotta love the pizza puff! A Chicago favorite. Staff is very nice as well. We didn't realize they closed at 8:30 tonight, walked up to the door at 8:25 and the nice lady at the register ran to the door to tell us to come in! That never happens! Always 1st class here and food is great!","Went back two nights ago. Still good. Tried the pizza amongst other things. Pizza is good. I hope they make it as I assume rent must be pretty high in that location and the size of the building leads one to think it is a premium priced location. It is a nice addition to Surprise.","I haven't been here since the name change. I was in the mood for some pizza slices and not the whole pie which is prevalent at pizza joints around town. The last time I ate here I wasn't impressed with the pizza, but my daughter and I fought over their garlic knots. . Anyone who describes this pizza as New York style must from the most rural parts of the state. It's just way too crispy to be NY style. Maybe this should be Charlotte style pizza. I was starving, so I ate both slices I ordered. What can I say, I love pizza so I'm going to make the best of what's put in front of me. . The garlic knots were better than the pizza. They were pretty large and fluffy, more like a small dinner roll size than a knot. It wasn't the way I remembered, but it was good. . I'm happy for those that are satisfied with this place- but when it comes to NY style slices, they miss the target.","Wow - I can't believe I am the first person to review Bite and Brews - which is a great little place located next to the ever popular Elbow Room.  . One of the biggest reasons to go here is that they have wheat crust pizza. They also put this amazing seasoning on the crust. You can order a whole pizza or just a slice and they have lots of toppings to choose from. I like that the pizza is not greasy. The side salad is huge, the pizza slices are huge. The bar has an extensive draft list.  . Bites and Brews isn't fancy, but it is nicer than a dive bar. I think the price is right too. The front door is garage door style so when the weather is nice the door is open and you can sit outside or just outside.","Happy to see another modern Italian dining option! I tried Cibo last night (Tuesday) with three friends. Three of us arrived first and the fourth came later on. The restaurant was packed when we arrived at 7:30 pm. Sadly the wait for the patio was over an hour, but luckily there was an inside table opening up. We were seated within 5 minutes without reservations. . The interior of the restaurant is beautiful. They have used a lot of local repurposed materials. The space feels casual, open, and contemporary. Our table was in a very loud spot, near the kitchen, but I imagine some of the corner tables must be a bit quieter. . We ordered three scodellina; tuscan chicken liver, arancini and lamb meatballs. The servings were too small. For $11 we got two loonie-sized arancini, three slightly smaller lamb meatballs, and approx 3 tbsp chicken liver spread. I would rather pay a bit more and get more food. I am a huge fan of arancini, and Cibo's may be my favourite in the city (aside from the small portion). The veal inside is a great addition. I notice on the website menu, the lamb meatballs and arancini are available as antipasti on the lunch menu, potentially these are larger servings? We also ordered the sausage pizza and the mushroom pizza. Both were great. The crust is a bit sweet. The caramelized onions on the sausage pizza were my favourite part. . The bar has Village beer on tap, and they serve it by the glass instead of the pint. I prefer it this way, but others may want the full pint. . The service is a bit slow, and the appetizers took close to 20 minutes to come out. I get a bit of an amateur vibe from the servers, like this is their first serving job. They still do a good job, but you don't get the same level of care as restaurants with a similar price point.","Very good pizza, chipotle style order, friendly customer service, fresh ingredients, thin crust, loved it. . . . .","Pricey (6 tacos and 2 drinks for $25) but the tacos were delicious and flavorful. We unfortunately couldn't tell which was which but we're not picky. We split everything between two people and wish they had given us two plates instead of just one. Service was quick enough - we weren't in a rush. Nice location - in the same place as a pizza place and donut shop. We got donuts for dessert.","Visited today, very nice young woman up front, took my 'to go' order. . . . . . all the employees up front were very nice. . . . . . . . I got my order FAST and she asked  if I needed help carrying stuff. . . . . . she was very nice. . . . . . . our pizzas were great, the WINGS are really great- ovenbaked, not fried. . . . . . . they are marinated and I requested no onions and they respected my request. . . . . . they were AWESOME. . . . . . best in the city, including places known just for wings. . . . . . . also got the meatballs and ricotta. . . . . . . EXCELLENT meatballs and sauce. . . . . . . . just grrrrreat !!!!!!!!! LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!! Very nice employees!","The crust is very good but I wish the cheese had a little more flavor. We had the white pizza with spinach. It was good, but not as good as I've had elsewhere.","Such a good place. Cheap and quick! A good casual dining option for the area. All of the salads are AMAZING. My favorites: kale and salmon salad and lasagna pizza","Canadian comfort food is this places tag line but its so much more than that. This O&amp;B owned cafe &amp; restaurant takes simple comfort food, upscales it and twists it. From roasted duck poutine pizza to high end mac and cheese this place reinvents comfort food at a reasonable price.","Omg!! The best pizza I have had in a very long time. I ordered the BBQ Chicken and it was amazing. The perfect BBQ sauce to pizza ratio. Not too dry, not too wet. I definitely will be coming back! Yum.","I should have ran fast after walking in, the place smelled. The service was horrible. The food terrible, the buffalo chicken flatbread pizza was dry and flavor less. The staff must like the food because they were all sitting in the corner eating. The bathrooms dirty. Will not be back.","Just great pizza    was at libretto yest which I love and by accident stopped in on way downtown because of a pitcher Margherita special sign outside     just blown away    hands down best pizza in Toronto    I asked and the owner hails from Naples which makes sense     seriously folks   try the pie here     it is insanely good","I honestly cannot get enough Greek food, it is  so delicious and Montreal shines through in this field. . This place has been open for about a year, the first thing that I noticed is how friendly the waitresses are. They know the menu inside out and seem to be so at ease. . The positive vibe and modern decor helps to make the food so much better. And it's already great to begin with. . This is the kind of Greek restaurant that only serves Greek food. No pizza, subs, poutine etc. . The souvlaki pita has this charred smoky taste , I love the chicken as well as gyros. They have these amazing Greek potatoes but ran out last time so I got fries/rice last time. It's good but I'll choose the potatoes every time. . Another wonderful thing they have is a Cretan salad. It's similar to a Greek salad but the cheese is different and they add a red wine dressing and rusk bread. As a side dish it was gigantic and kind of hard to find in Montreal. . It's pretty well located and as central as it gets, about 5 minutes walk from jarry metro and right off St-Laurent boulevard. . In the summer, Jarry park is nearby for a nice picnic idea.","So I'll say this. . . I really like pizza. I like pizza about every way that it can be made. But one thing I don't care for is chain pizza establishments. Don't get me wrong, I won't turn it down. But I much more prefer independently owned and operated. However, in the case of Anthony's, this is about as good as a chain gets.  . We have been here about five times, and have had quality food on a consistent basis. When you first walk into the restaurant there is typically a hostess directly inside that opens the door and greets you. Nice touch. I've never had to wait for a table, but it has always been fairly busy.  . Start off with the wings. If you've never had the wings before ask the server and they will give you a sampling of two. The wings are wood fired and have a rosemary dry seasoning on them, then topped with caramelized onions. FANTASTIC!  . As far as pizza, I have tried the margherita, the paul and young ron, and your basic peperoni. I loved them all. They give you balsamic and olive oil, and I suggest dipping your crust in either. YUM!  The crust is always just slightly blackened on the edges, which I love. The margherita has no sauce with mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. The paul and ron young has peppers, meatballs, sausage, and ricotta. . The service has always been friendly and accommodating.  . They seem to have some good beer, although I've never drank there. The soft drinks and tea comes bottled. So no free refills. But who cares, its a quality product.  . The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the food came out kinda quick. I wanted just a little more time to eat my wings. And this happens because the oven cooks the food quick. So this is just a timing problem. All and all, good food, nice people, a bit pricey, but the product is worth it in my opinion.","Tried the New York Combo. It was good pizza. It taste like a NY pizza to me. They open the box for you to look at before you leave. I love the service.","This place has the best bbq chicken pizza and garlic fries! The only downfall is that it is so far away from Tempe. I have yet to find a better place to eat at a reasonable price. You must try it and I promise you won't regret it! Can't wait to see you again joe's farm grill!!!!","I was staying at Mandalay Bay with some girlfriends and we decided to try this place for dinner on a Saturday night. We didn't have a reservation but we got seated right away. The atmosphere was elegant and sophisticated, but the staff was really friendly and helpful. . Drinks: They have an enormous and extravagant wine and champagne list here if you're looking to splurge. Most are by the bottle but they have a nice selection by the glass, too. My friends and I ordered cocktails though. I had the raspberry lemon drop which was super tasty and not too strong. My friend got some cherry martini which was super strong but still tasted pretty good. . Food: My friend and I split the pizza with sausage and rapini (Italian style broccoli). It was delicious! And splitting it was perfect because we didn't want to be too full for dancing and drinking later in the evening. My other friend got the calf liver. . . don't ask me why. . . she was not a huge fan. . . . Overall I would definitely recommend Lupo if you are looking for good food and a reasonable price (considering you are in Las Vegas!!!), however I don't feel the need to return next time I visit Vegas.","Saturday night, Valentine's Weekend around 7 pm - Larger tables sat quicker from what I could tell when we were waiting. I was with one other person and we waited upwards of 50 minutes for a table. When we were finally sat it was by the door where it was really drafty. It was below freezing out, and we were both really cold. The food was great though when it came, and it somewhat warned us up. We ordered the tortilla soup, nachos, Diablo pizza, and 2 am burger. The soup was delicious. I'm itching to have another bowl already. I also tried their darkest beer that had hints of cacao and peanut butter. I'm not a beer fan, but I really liked it. Our waitress was extremely nice as well. We were comped 20 something dollars when we didn't even complain or say anything. It was a nice surprise when we got our bill. I'll definitely be back.","Cute ambiance/theme. . . very reasonable prices and specials. . . . Could this possibly be the new Mamma Mia. . . hmmm I don't think anyone can top Mamma Mia, but it does come kinda close. The ingredients that MM used still reminds me of what NY pizza tasted like. I'll definitely come back to try the spinach dip and wings also.","We first had Giordanos Famous Stuffed Pizza in Chicago back in 1979. This was our go-to pizza place. So perfect. So delicious. Now that it's out here - I can honestly say it is just as perfect and just as delicious as the original back in Chicago. The restaurant has a great atmosphere. . FOR THOSE THAT  ARE NEW TO STUFFED PIZZA- because of the thickness it takes about an hour for it to bake. But be patient-it's worth the wait!","For me delivery pizza is its own thing, and Falbo is a favorite. I have to admit up front that I will order a thin crust cheese, and when It shows up I'll throw some faux pepperoni on it and stick it under the broiler for a bit. Be that as it may, there is much to love about their pizza:. The crust it crispy and chewy and is not sweet. As someone enamored with their own pizza crust achievements at home, I love theirs. Make no mistake, this is not your pizza fired at 1000 degrees for 6 minutes using a Neapolitan dough, but it's damned good crust. . I love their sauce. It's thick and loaded with dried oregano and basil. I assume they use canned Marzano tomatoes and cook everything down for a long time, but maybe that's fantasy. I like their sauce for what I get from the taste. And I taste good tomato and oregano and basil, and I am happy. . And if you're a freak like me who can't wait to slide 4 slices out of the box, load them up with fake pepperoni and stick them into a broiler, you'll be happy. I'm sure other delivery pizza folks will love them too.","Came to Pittsburgh to visit and read a few good reviews on this restaurant. It definitely produced. Some of the best pizza I have ever eaten. We will definitely visit this establishment on our next trip back to Pittsburgh. I loved the ground up pepperoni on the pizza.","My buddies and me are quite the sheesha fiends. And why not? Sheesha is a great way to relax with friends and in the pleasurable company of other people but not in one of Calgary's many bars. And Caf\u00e9 Med is the first sheesha bar I went to, oh so many years ago. It is THE classic on the Calgary sheesha scene. . They definitely have some of the best sheesha and the best ambiance in Calgary. Velvet curtains open into a smoke-filled room covered in tapestries and blasting middle easten-style music. The tables are all small benches around larger tables that can sit anywhere from two to twelve. When it is busy (Friday-Sunday), it's not unusual to be sharing a table with one or more groups! Service varies significantly depending on how busy the night is, which can be unfortunate. . Once you are seated (which can take a while - service is touch and go here), they'll bring you a menu full of tasty Mediterranean treats - fatoosh and pizza and hummus and falafel and everything in between. I really love cheese, so I'm partial to the pita mozzarella which is like pita and mozza and cheese and deliciously edible. FYI - the food is quite good, but can take a while to get to your table. Also, you have a truly great selection of teas and non-alcoholic beverages. The Moroccan Mint is to die for. Then you can order one of over twenty different flavours of sheesha, sit back and blow smoke rings. My faves - White Grape and Cherry Bomb. Perfect place for a chill night.","With a lack of great pizza places (that deliver) in or around Ohio City, we have chosen to order from Sainatos several times. All times were pretty much just like the last. . We ordered a large pepperoni pizza and a side order of Jalapeno poppers. The poppers were horrible. They were obviously frozen and heated up, but not even the good frozen brand. The breading was weak (aka soggy) and they had absolutely NO flavor. So very, very disappointed. That was the first and last time we order those. . The pizza, we have ordered in the past and they were just okay. Not great, but edible. But this time, it was disgusting. The dough was not fully cooked, it was still very doughy. . So the next day we decided to reheat the pizza using our pizza stone (why we didn't think of this the night before, I don't know, maybe just too tired or too disgusted) anyway the dough crisped up nicely and became not great, but edible, just okay. . The best part of the pizza was the toppings. They put a ton of cheese and pepperonis on it which was at least something, but not enough to keep me coming back. . After this experience I don't think we'll order from here again, we have actually been experiencing with making our own pizzas at home, and so far our worst pizza has been way better than the best they have delivered to us). . Any Ohio City people out there reading this. . . PLEASE open up an awesome pizza place (that delivers). We are sooooo desperately missing that here!","Great pizza and food. Love eating here. The staff is always great . . . . except for one. Teresa!  Honey. You need to calm the f**k down with your attitude. I'm definitely not in the mood to get attitude from some little brat who thinks she can treat customers unkindly. To show your customer that you're annoyed by simple questions, is a sign that you shouldn't be in the service industry. Management needs to sit down with you. Or maybe you should go back to the fryer at McDonald's.","I work int he plaza right beside this place. . . . the service is a little slow during lunch hours but other than its good indian food for the right price and a good filling lunch. . food has always been on point. . . . I have tried their choley bhaturay and vege thali. . . Price wise its a much better bang for your buck than any other fast food chain like subway and pizzanova. . . . . . if you enjoy indian food its a place to check out. . .","The pizza and hoagies here are absolutely amazing. I do, however, recommend picking it up as delivery can sometimes take a bit long. Understandably so, the food is great!","First time trying vegan pizza and I give it two thumbs up. Very crispy thin crust and full of veggys also NOT lacking any flavor. The vegan pizza was very flavorful I would definitely order again.","I stumbled upon Sorella's while browsing through pizza joints on Yelp. I placed an order over the phone, and 35 minutes later the delivery driver is knocking on my door. He delivered a still piping hot pizza and subs, along with jo jo's and bacon bombs. The food was excellent and you get lots of it! So in review, Sorella's gives you great food, lots of it, with fast courteous delivery. What's not to like? This was my first order. . . but not my last!","Very UNHAPPY with Happy's. My son LOVES their pizza, and that is the ONLY reason I put up with them. It always takes at least one hour for food to be delivered. Twice it took them 1 1/2 hours, and when we got the food, it was cold. . . DUH. Three other times the pizza we ordered arrived with toppings that we did not ask for or want. Really Happy's? Hire some more delivery drivers if this seems to be an ongoing issue with lots of people. Service is not JUST for tourists who eat your food once. Locals need decens places. BTW- Food, when it does come , is average. Not worth all of the hassle","There were 4 of us adults and 2 children (a 4 yr old and a 16 month old toddler) and we got charged gratuity!!! The website said gratuity is charged for a party of 6 guess they counted the children as 2 people. The food was mediocre and not worth the prices charged for the dishes. Our server was grumpy and rude and refused to let me charge my phone in an absolutely empty restaurant. We asked her if she could add chicken to the pesto base pizza and she absolutely refused therefore customer service was a joke. I would not recommend anyone going there. If you're looking for good Italian food then Jamie's Italian and Scaddabush at Square one are much better options that have excellent food with much better prices and customer service to match.","What a great place. The staff was warm and friendly and walked us through the process. I had explained to my family this was like subway for pizza but they didn't get it until we went through the process. My husband was thrilled with the 2 x 1 beer too. . Pizza was excellent, the place is very clean and the pizza was out very very fast. I will recommend to everyone who wants a casual dining experience.","As far as the wings and bar food go, it's alright, but the actual Pizza, pasta, calzones, etc. . BEST PLACE EVER. . I'm a huge pizza snob and Rino's pizza makes me want to savor every bite (because it's really not cheap). So I tend to only order here if it's a special occasion (today's my anniversary) . Get the Margherita. It's topped with so much stuff. Not like those other places that give you a thin slice of tomato and cheese on some mediocre crust, Rino's actually fills you up and has amazing flavor, not bland at all. Their crust is the best too. I never eat pizza crust, but I eat every morsel of Rino's.","One of our favorite places to go with the kids. Very cozy, and clean environment. It feels like home. The food and portions are great! Hey bake the bread fresh as they serve the sandwiches. Hummus is yummy! The chicken shawarma sandwich is so delicious it's a must try. And the fries yummy!!! Just if you order take out make sure to tell them to put condiments. Last time I picked up we had so much fries not even 1 ketchup . And we weren't eating at home, so was a bummer. And there's another cool thing they have on the menu. They have doh for the kids to make bread or pizza, or just play. It's just $1 extra but entertains the kids, and they even cook it for you to take home! So much fun!","Spectacular Sicilian food from something that looks like a pizza joint from the outside. Wow! Prices are generally reasonable, but ask about the prices for the specials BEFORE you order to avoid surprises. . If you have a chance, call ahead an arrange for a tasting, which is a 4-7 course meal consisting of samples of different foods (pasta course, fish course, meat course, etc. ) for somewhere around $50-$60 per person. . The food here comes as close to Italy and Sicily as anything I've had in the Pittsburgh area and the fact that you may need reservations on the week shows that I am not alone in this thought.","My favorite pizza in Pittsburgh. Competing against the two other anchoring pizza joints on Murray Ave, Napoli's by far wins. They provide a richer cheese and more of it on top of an actual doughy and crispy crust. Both of Napoli's competition fall short with too much grease and a plastic tasting crust, where it can be replicated with frozen pizza.  . In contrast, Napoli's Pizza provides an authentic red or white pizza with generous toppings from crispy pepperoni, rich bacon, hearty mushrooms, juicy spinach, to spicy banana peppers. . Aesthetically, Napoli's is a pizza joint with the same green booths one would expect to find in a \"little Italy, \" creating a small, friendly and cozy familiarity between the pizza makers and customers. At lunch, this place is packed with customers buying pizza by the slice, ordering fried zucchini, and munching on toasted hoagies. . If you're not up for sitting-in, delivery is always a quick and available option. The pizza is always delivered pipping hot and fast.","Sauce is a great Quick Serve place. I had the Chix Caesar Salad it was large and filling and quite good. The sangria is nice as well. . . I like the koolaid touch around the edge of the glass. My man had the bruchetta caprese style and it was awesome. . . the tomatoes were perfectly ripe and the mozzarella was fresh and creamy. The bread was a really crusty yet fluffy yet able to hold up to the mix piece of wonder. . . we found out they get it from LaBrea. If you want a great quick lunch or dinner check it out. . . we look forward to trying the pizza and pasta next time!","Not happy with our first visit. Ordered a bowl which included meat balls. Not sure what was in them; tasted as though there was some kind of filler. However, the Alfredo Fettuccine bowl  and eggplant parmigiana sub were good. . We had a problem finding a clean table when we entered and in the end cleaned our own. Also, the floor was in bad need for sweeping. . My guess - this probably is a good place for takeout pizza.","This place has come a long way since it first opened. The atmosphere is casual and dark and friendly. The food is interesting, flavorful and thoughtful. . You can tell that people who own Sardine take the same type of care with the menu here. I would call this casually sophisticated- even the wines by the glass seem to be carefully chosen and also well-priced. I also appreciate how late they are open. They cater to a very diverse crowd- from families in the early part of the evening, to older people later on and everyone in between. I've tried a number of dishes here, including the portobella sandwich and most recently, the clam pie. It's all fresh and well executed. The surprise here is how great the pizza is! And also, the homemade desserts are incredible. Apparently, they change often, so the servers just recite them rather than hand you a list. . My one suggestion is that they cut back a little on the nuts and raisins in the carrot cake. Other than that, keep doing what you are doing! Madison is lucky to have this place.","Wait is usually pretty long but it's worth it. Their deep dish pizza is great. Friendly staff. I do think Lou Malnati's is a little better but they are both good. Be prepared though, deep dish pizza does take a while to cook.","The one thing that stands out about this place is atmosphere. The owner, Joe Johnston grew up in this building as it was his childhood home, and you can tell he still cares about the place. Always clean, very friendly, wonderful atmosphere. I talked to him personally at one of their customer appreciation days, he is one of the entrepreneurs in Arizona I would say. The burgers are nothing special, hence the four star rating, but the fries and pizza and milkshakes are a must when I go here. The line is usually out the door and around the building, but well worth the wait.","Really loved Destihl! Right across the street from our hotel at the Hyatt. Downtown Champaign is such a cute area. We went at 2p on a Sunday and they had a 25 minute wait! Must be pretty good, right? We found a couple spots at the bar, sat down right away. The gentleman bartender was kind of not in the game to help us, took awhile to order until the lady bartender came over, then we were taken care of immediately. To his credit, they were getting drink orders non-stop, and was busy making those drinks. . We got the fried green tomatoes (Awesome!), I got the corn and chicken chowder (Average) and we shared the veggie pizza. I HIGHLY recommend the fried tomatoes, although it was only two actual slices, the dish was just fantastic. Crab salad on top is a new twist I've never seen, but will definitely make at home. It was incredible. . The corn and chicken chowda' was good, but nothing special. Corn, Chicken, spice, I probably wouldn't order it again, but it was good. . The pizza was fantastic, loaded with toppings, and they split it for us. . Overall a great experience. . doubt I'll be back in Champaign IL anytime soon, but if I do, we'll be back to Destihl! Wish we had one in Edwardsville.","Come ON! . Maybe I'm not getting what Yelp is about. Is it supposed to be an \"experience\" rating or something? Or are you supposed to (attempt to) objectively evaluate the quality of the food we're reviewing? Cause this food is shit. I ordered it a few times when I first moved here and never again. I've had the pepperoni sheet pizza at a local bar and I'll only eat it cause it's Sunday night and I've probably been partying. . Doesn't free pizza usually taste the best? Not when it's from OCP. . Super salty or they put tons of onion powder in the sauce, I don't know what it is but it makes my stomach hurt, badly. Two pieces of this stuff has prematurely ended my evening more than once, I vow not to do it to myself anymore, even if its free. . I continue to lament the lack of an even passable pizza place that's actually in Ohio City. There are a few delivery options that are decent, but no real pizza joint. . There are a lot of urban hipsters on here who think that just cause you're independent, you deserve a higher rating. Just try to focus on the food. Do you understand that just blindly \"supporting local business\" often means that you're perpetuating mediocrity?","Vegan review:. One word: yes. . As a vegan, I thought it would be hard to find food in Vegas. Turns out every Wynn restaurant has a vegan/vegetarian menu which explains why I was at the Wynn almost every day. . Anyways, I had the veggie pizza in the \"socializing\" part of the menu (fancy way of saying \"appetizer\" I guess), and my god it was good. The vegan ricotta was very light and fluffy. It didn't really taste like cheese but who am I to say? I haven't had cheese for like 8 years. Toppings were generous and they all paired together nicely. I finished about \u00be of it and took the rest back to the hotel to eat later. If you're vegan, I highly recommend the pizza! Even my brother (who is a strict carnivore) enjoyed it!","Very good pizza. It's very pricy, but hey, you're at the Aria. If you're expecting cheap pizza, order Domino's. All the ingredients worked together perfectly. My wife and I ordered the Forager to take back to our room at the Vdara. The pizza took about half an hour to cook. If you want just a slice, they sell massive slices for $5. 50. That's probably what we will do next time. Ordering a whole pizza is just too much for two people. We were both starving and still had about a quarter of the pie left when we were stuffed. Expect to pay 25-35 dollars for a to-go pizza. Again, it's great pizza, but don't expect it to be cheap.","What an adorable place! I've been dying to try it out, and it did not disappoint. Wine prices were typical for a wine bar- would recommend getting a bottle for the best pricing. I tried the white blend by recommendation from our waitress, and it was exactly what I wanted. Their goat cheese stuffed peppadews were delicious and I would go back again just for the stuffed artichokes! Great decor and I've heard the pizzas are amazing. I could sit on the outdoor patio for hours, can't wait to return!","I've stayed here several times. Granted, i wasn't looking for 4 Diamond amenities, in my book it's 2. 5 stars on this scale. Another disclaimer: I greatly prefer Downtown to the Strip, and have tried to seek out fun spots to enjoy, so distance from the Strip isn't an issue. They have upgraded/renovated the FSE-facing rooms. Two visits ago they gave me one at no charge, wanted an upcharge the next time. I'm back in a month, for $19/night. . My rooms have always been clean and smoke free. The heater/aircon units have sometimes been noisy. I don't hear much noise between rooms. The rooftop pool can be a very relaxing low key place to kick back. No worries if you bring your own drinks up if you do it without flaunting it. I don't think i've ever eaten there, but always start the day with coffee from the stand, where you get a free refill with the receipt. . I always park in the outdoor parking lot just on the other side of the bus station. For dining, i try to hit: the weekend champagne next door at the Main St Station; the pizza at the Old Chicago Brewery in the Four Queens; the 1. 25 beers at the newly renovated Gold Spike; the absolutely delicious Kabab Korner just across LVB on Fremont; breakfast at Binion's; prime rib at Magnolia's at the 4 Queens; and looking forward to checking out Hugo's Celler there next month. . Fun activities include: taking in a baseball game [minor league 51's] at Cashman Field, a 15 minute walk; taking the double decker bus up the Strip [by catching it at the main bus station on Stewart]; enjoying some really cheap Crown drinks at the Dome in the Plaza. . . . Summary: not for everybody, or for those expecting strip like amenities. The Golden Nugget is the downtown sport for that. But, a decent place for those on a budget who don't mind exploring a bit. . .","We order delivery from here regularly. The wings are great! Crispy and well seasoned. I definitely suggest getting one wet portion and one dry portion- seriously, they're that good. The service is always very quick. There pizza is also very tasty. Ironically,  I'm not a big hot dog person, but the menu is comprehensive enough that is never an issue. This is definitely a spot I'd recommend for good food, done right.","Tasty. They have several options of pizza by the slice to go or you can dine in their restaurant. Tried the one with pepperoni and sauce whicb was clearly the most popular. Pretty good, nice crispy crust. Pizza crust is pretty thin. There is a sports arena down the hall from this place that you can take your pizza with you. Also tried their meatball sandwhich which had a very juicy moist meatball topped with marinated italian veggie toppings for nice crunch and texture. Nice easy cheap dining option inside the Aria. Will be bavk again.","Tom Tom for short is a little gem that presents a nice variety for the impulsive or indecisive. Whether you're in the mood for stone oven pizza, salads, deli sandwiches, flatbread, croissants, wraps, soups or even some specialty dishes like lasagna and calzone, smoothies and any combo of the above, you'll find it here!  . I dined in, enjoying the place to myself. It was around 2:30 pm so it was past the lunch rush. I opted for the soup and half bistro sandwich combo for under $9. They offered jambalaya or tomato basil soup. I am kind of a wimp with spice, so I asked the gentleman at the counter for his opinion about the spice level. As he knows spiciness is relative, he offered me a taste. That's always the best solution in this case. I was delighted the spice level was tolerable because the soup was delicious and satisfying. The full bowl was chock-full of chicken, sausage, rice, celery, onions in a hearty tomato broth, and served with some oyster crackers. I paired the soup with a half honey cured ham and Swiss cheese on 9 grain wheat, tomato, greens, red onion, honey mustard and mayo. . Seating accommodates 18. There are outlets to recharge your devices. It's comfortable with air conditioning and ceiling fans. There is no public restroom. A couple of their fountain drinks were out. Deliveries are from 10:30 am - 2:30 pm,  require a $25 minimum and is subject to a 10% delivery fee. Credit cards accepted.","Very good selection of beer with rotating taps. . All coal fired, so the pizza and or anything else is crispy. . Salads are great especially with extra olives and cheese. . Good for a weekday dinner on the way home from work, and if you don't want to order in they have curbside.","Just ordered pizza and the guy says it will take an hour. I just live 1 mile away and don't have time so I tell the guy I need to cancel. He says ok I will make right away and be right there. 1 hour later the delivery guy knocks on our door.","DaBuzis has the best pizza and wings around. The amount of street parking isn't great but the food won't disappoint!","This pizza place is amazing! We had the real deal. . . . . so delicious! Not greasy at all! Kids loved the pepperoni and garlic bread sticks. ALL of the staff are super friendly! We will definitely be back!","Came all the way from Kentucky to experience Bruno's amazing pizza!!!! Fresh ingredients, incredible sauce and the crust was top of the line. . . and you must try the homemade Caesar salad. The staff was attentive and extremely friendly. And the food came out faster than I would have ever expected!! . Definitely worth leaving the hustle and bustle of the strip. Don't miss out on this gem!!","Loved this pizza. Nice and thick. Going back tomorrow to buy one and take it home to Cali. The girl at the register was very nice.","This is THE BEST pizza in Charlotte!! Every time we order, it's consistently delicious! Definitely a loyal customer!","It would be a 3. 5 if I could, but here is what I have to say: Pizza 73 is mediocre, but its cheap, and mediocre pizza doesn't mean all their menu items are. The 4 Pak+ For example, I loved their funnel cake stix, and the giant cookie actually tasted amazing, however the pizza is bland, but the wedgies are fine. Their wings aren't bad but I can easily make better tasting ones at home. The potato wedges are pretty good but nothing thats gonna change your opinion about this place. In short, if you are hungry for pizza or some form of dessert and don't plan on spending much come here, don't dine here for quality.","Please stay AWAY from this location!!! I love Papa Johns so much I keep coming back, but it never fails I get the worse customer service. If I could give it NO STARS I would considering 2/3 of the times I order pizza I NEVER receive it whether it's ordered online or over the phone. Then when I call them back they act like I never placed an order.","I've been three times now. Great pizza with great pricing. We had the Thursday night special. Any 14\" specialty pizza and large rustic salad. The Malibu bbq pizza was fantastic. Not too sweet and just the right amount of toppings. The Italian Kitchen salad was full of meat and cheese, great olive tapenade with artichoke hearts and roasted peppers. All this food for $20. This will be our Thursday night standard!","Just went to Anthony's. Overall I thought the pizza was good. I liked the sauce on the plain cheese pizza. It was sweet and a little zesty. I get the idea of a oven fired pizza and everything, but the crust on the pizza (my favorite part) was burnt. The Philly cheese steak pizza was also very good. The place was packed - not sure if it was because it was a Friday during Lent or what, but we waited for 45 minutes. A little weird - when I asked for a Coke it was given to me in a plastic bottle. . . do they not have a fountain machine like every other restaurant? The server was very nice and personable. He highly recommend the wings. It was a little loud for me. The prices were fair - actually less than I thought they might be.","We tried this place for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. The pizza was very good and the delivery was quick.","15 Times and counting. One of my favorite MGM perks but would gladly pay for the great steak  The service is exquisite. The location is kinda noisy as it is right next to the pizza place but the ambiance is very nice. Mac  &amp; Cheese and   Butterfly Filet for both me  &amp; my better half.","My husband and I had a most wonderful Rosati's pizza called the Monster. I was a little skeptical of the bacon on it but it worked out perfect along with the other meat and vegetable toppings. And the crust is great. Not a crumb was left. If you have not tried it, I do highly recommend.","We love their thin crust pizza and are sad the location on Gilbert and Germann closed!","Once again, I just spent nearly two weeks staying at this hotel. Here's the state of the Flamingo today:. 1. Now that the former Imperial Palace has undergone a massive makeover from casino to the rooms as the Linq, the Flamingo seems to be taking its place in the Caesars portfolio as the affordable dive on the strip. The Fab rooms look great, but you can tell that they money to refurbish ran out in the bathrooms. When the elevator stops on some floors you'll notice that the baseboards have been removed and some floors look older and more tired than others. . 2. The elevators have become downright scary. Many have been redecorated except the control panels haven't been replaced. Some cabs have missing buttons for floors. Some cabs the floor lights up on one side and not the other. One cab's digital floor readout says \"2V\" and if you press a certain number of buttons it forgets what floors you've punched in and you have to press them all over again. During my stay entire banks of elevators failed during peak hours on a Saturday. They need to get these fixed quickly. The IP had a reputation for horrible elevators, but they were completely redone as the Linq. They need to do the same thing next door at the Flamingo, quickly. . 3. Food options are dwindling at this hotel. They closed the coffee shop (I admit it, I miss the ladies who waited on me every morning for close to 10 years) and cut the hours of the buffet. After an underwhelming meal at the food court and an awful meal at Carlos &amp; Charlie's, I ended up eating most meals at the Linq. I forgot all about Margaritaville until after I left, but it is one of the better restaurants at the hotel. The all night pizza joint next to the steakhouse now has more seating since the coffee shop has been shuttered. . 4. The Total Rewards kiosk for checking in has been removed. At peak hours check-in lines can be long. . 5. Housekeeping didn't service my room or the one next to me one day. They sent a housekeeper up to my room at midnight to service it. Whoops. . 6. The pool is still pretty awesome. . Add it all up and you have a decent room for the price. This is far from one of the nicest hotels on the Strip, but it's well located and usually well priced. The Go rooms are more fun than the Fab rooms (but the Go rooms are starting to show their age) but for a place to lay your head it does the job. I found myself spending more time at the Linq because it's nicer, has better food, and is more fun. If you're on a budget, stay at Flamingo and play at the Linq. . But if Caesars is reading these reviews, PLEASE fix the elevators at this hotel. You can skimp on other things, but you've got to do something about the elevators!","I love this pizza place! They have a large variety of options, and it you like ranch you are going to love theirs!!!","The food was good but very expensive. My friend and I needed somewhere casual to eat inside Aria and because this restaurant was listed as such, we thought that the prices would reflect that. I ordered a whole pizza at $28, but you can walk up and order by the slice for about $5 and change. The Forager Pizza consists of a white sauce and plenty of mozzarella topped with mushrooms, spinach, large pieces of ham and whipped ricotta. It had a balance of salty and sweet but the ham became overwhelming and it could have used a better ratio of veggies. My friend ordered the Spaghetti and added Housemade Meatballs. We both agreed that the spaghetti was tasty but the meatballs were off. The beer selection is fantastic, as is the decor. I just didn't feel that the food that we received exactly hit the mark or was worth the high price.","Fist time eating in this spot I I highly recommend this location very good pizza, wings and mojo for a great price for all that. I'm from LA and would definitely come back and eat this again when I'm in town.","This is the brick an mortar of Sin City Wings and Ben's BBQ. The owners are the sweetest people you will ever meet. They obviously really care about the food they are serving and making sure you leave happy. I will say you should be prepared to wait a bit for your food. I went on opening day so I'm sure it won't be as bad once the kinks get worked out, but I waited over 45 for my food despite there only being 5 other tables seated. Luckily they were playing the Food Network on the TV so I kept myself entertained. Besides the wait, everything was great! It is a very casual environment located inside a gaming bar (Spectator's) The menu has a great variety of options from salads to BBQ and even pizza. It's so close to my house I'm sure I'll be back MANY MANY times! I can't wait for it to get even better!","This is my first review and how appropriate that it would be for one of my favorite pizza joints in AZ. We eat there (actually usually take to go) at least 3x/ month. . The Market fresh thin crust is always amazing. Every week it is different which is great. We have tried the ones on the menu but the weekly special is usually the best choice. . I like the deep dish but ask for light bake and extra sauce. This makes left overs great and I do not like a crunchy crust. . My wife likes the pizza crust and when combined with their sauce for \"dipping\" it is top notch. . The service is always good and the same people have been there for years (always a good sign). . I agree the beer selection is great and the bar tenders are very knowledgeable and can find a good match for anyone. They are one of the few places with 4 Peaks Hop Knot. . The house dressing is great and you can take home a bottle for $5 to enjoy all week.","Can't say enough good things about this place. Love their fresh and smoked mozzarella and pizza's. I definitely recommend this place!","This is the best pizza around hands down. While not cheap the quality and freshness are worth it. Try the Siciliano for a great thick crust that's not greasy. This is the place to go when you are craving pizza!","Laterna is a favorite spot of mine and the BF, when we are craving a simple souvlaki pita and a salad. Their prices are a bit moderate but split between two people, you usually come out about $15 a person. . . This place has been at the corner of  Athabasca and Yonge St. , ever since i was a little one and it is still a family run place more or less. . Their pita bread is good, nice and chewy, and it makes me wonder if they use the same base for their pizza, since I see a lot of neighborhood people ordering their pizza, we keep meaning too - but we keep going back  to their souvlaki pitas. . Their Greek salad is good from what I have had, since we have to skip the olives (due allergies) and their Caesar is good too, using more like a vinaigrette rather than a creamy base. . Even at it's busiest, the noise level never really reaches above a murmer, so it's also a great place for a no fuss, quiet meal. . A few things I feel like I should mention, there is absolutely no parking at this place; I normally park at the mall across the street and walk over, or try and find parking along the residential area. Laterna is, also, not open on Sundays at all.","2162242312 couldn't deliver a pizza or leave a voice mail guess they just lost a regular customer because they can't deliver","Was pretty good. The large is really big not like some shops (mamas for example) that sell you an extra large when it's barely a large. There stuffed pizza was nice but I would probably request extra sauce on the side as it's a tad dry. We will try it again I'm sure as the kids enjoyed it and they deliver far away.","First timers!  We purchased the \"local flavor\" coupon online to give it a try. Boneless wings, thin crust pizza &amp; cannoli's. All of the food was very good and the service was excellent!  We will totally be back. The only complaint that I have is that there was a guy at the bar who obviously had too much to drink (you could tell he was a regular) and was getting loud and using foul language. Yelling out the \"F\" word a few times. I do not have virgin ears and it doesnt bother me personally, but there were some small children at a booth not that far away. I get that its a \"bar\" but its also a restaurant and families are trying to enjoy themselves also.","The GOODYEAR Rosati's has always been very good to us!  I think their menu has changed over the past 6 years or so, but the pizza remains outstanding!  We normally went for the thin crust combo - very basic, very excellent crust!  The toppings are so good that it doesn't need a ton of crust to make up for it. . I have yet to try their deep dish or Chicago style pie but it's on the list of \"to try\" items. I'm working in the middle of Phoenix right now, so I'll be trying the location close to the airport. But when we lived in Goodyear, Rosati's was as good as it gets!  Memorable enough that I always get a pizza from here when I get the chance to stop by Goodyear for old times' sake!. **UPDATE** I have since had their deep dish Chicago pie twice and it is unbelievable - count yourself lucky, Phoenix, to have access to this type of pizza in your area - it's a rare treat!","Kinda pricey for what you get (over $3 for a slice) but it was very tasty and it's hard to resist the smell from outside! I'd splurge on a whole pizza next time for the money spent per slice.","If I could give this place negative stars I would. The food was absolutely terrible. I got one slice in and decided I'd have to go somewhere else for dinner. When I told the waitress, she asked the manager what could be done and gave us a small discount. I was not about to pay for two uneaten pizzas. I asked to speak to the manager myself and I am absolutely appalled at how I was treated. She told me that she would not comp my pizza because we had eaten some of the food, to which I replied that of course we had to try the food to know that it was bad. She said that if we had eaten the majority of our food then we would have to pay for it. I about lost my mind at this comment. There was one slice missing from the pizza. A single slice was gone from a six-slice pizza and she referred to it as the \"majority. \" When I finally made it clear that we should not and would not pay for such bad food and service, she rolled her eyes and scoffed \"ok\" at me and quickly walked away. This is without a doubt the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never be returning and I highly encourage that none of you try this restaurant. La Bocca and Mellow Mushroom are both pizzas places just a few blocks away and are superior in every sense of the word.","Awesome!!!!! The veggie salad was a great choice. I would absolutely recommend it to everyone. We had the chicken Parmesan pizza which was also delicious. They have the most amazing pizza dough. We started out with the caprice  app which was yummy and original","Been ordering from here for a while. I miss their sub sandwiches, which they took off their menu. Their pizzas are very good. I know everyone has their particular likes when it comes to sauce and dough, but this one makes the mark. Toppings are fresh and plentiful. Guy's fries are very indulgent but good. The Guyros are large, with somewhat processed lamb, but flavorful. We have ordered delivery from them, and have not been disappointed. I find it curious that three chain pizza delivery restaurants in the area have closed in the past year, but Guys keeps going strong. Must saysomething.","Visited with the whole family for the first time tonight and we are slightly disappointed. We frequently go to Old Chicago and Don's pizza where the pizza is great! Other reviewers had mentioned long wait times and lackluster service but that is not our complaint. The major complaint is the food. The Spaghetti lacked flavor and the kids pizza was flavorless as well with a hard dey crust. After mentioning the food to the manager she brought a meat flavored marinara that was better and helped with the flavor and offered fresh garlic to enhance taste. We initily thought that the waiter hated her job and didn't want to be there, but she later redeemed herself. we'll have to say that our expectations were much higher hearing about the reputation from Chicago, but honestly the existing chain restaurants are outperforming at this point. so have to give this one a 3. and only because the manager really cared about how happy we were about the food.","Checked out Corrado's for the first time tonight as its a new place in the neighbourhood. It simply exceeded expectations in all ways: We ordered the arancinis and they were delicious; the service is genuine and the owner, Corrado, works the 12-14 hour shifts himself as he wants to genuinely get to know his customers. We walked in when they actually should have been closed already and they still made our order and gave us a free drink and the left over pizza for the night. The pizza was also incredibly tasty. Overall, Corrado's offers great value as the food tastes great and the portion sizes are generous - a testament to the owner. A must try if you're ever in the area!","There are better pizza choices nearby. The service is meh. The kids meals are bizarrely spicy. Our food was not hot and borderline cold. It took forever to get our meals and the food came out at all different times. . The food was tasty and would have been a lot better if it had been served hot. The kids meals are really not appropriate for most children though. And unfortunately, the service was downright lousy.","What an impressive dinner with some friends. . Loved every bit.  . Had the steak / pizza and some serious wine. . Service was excellent. They took care of everything. . It was everything you can ask for in a dinner out. Looking forward to my next visit.","RECOMMEND. Although its a very simple interior, pizzas are very tasty!. Would defiantly recommend this place for REAL PIZZA!","We ordered the Little Gem Caesar salad and the Margherita pizza. We shared between three people and were full. The pizza was delicious. The sauce was sweeter than most places but very good. The salad had larger pieces of lettuce. Would definitely go back.","We LOVE Fat Cats!  They have movies (with recliners), bowling, glow in the dark golfing, arcade and more!  Our experience has always been stellar!  Never had any issues- great seats, great movies!  The app and website are perfect. The pizza delivered to your chair is delicious and always eaten even with picky kids (adults too). . If you are looking for a great date night or family fun/ this place has it all!","You know what?!  I love Brewsters. . . and I say it proudly!  I've only ever had good experiences every time I go. . Not only do I love the location (Crowfoot NW, by all my friends) but I love the restaurant itself. It has a nice ambiance inside, with a lounge area and gorgeous patio for the summer!  The lounge has plenty of high stools and tables, which I love, but also has booths and chairs by the bar. . I'll admit that the cost of drinks might be a little higher than say Boston Pizza, but i think it's fair. They have a bunch of their own beer. . . in fact, that's all they serve. You can't get Keith's or Canadian at this place. Only Brewsters brewed beer. It's pretty neat. My favourite is the blueberry beer they have. . . which comes with blueberries in it. Very yummy!. They have a nice selection on their food menu as well. They offer a different variety of pizzas and appetizers. . . stuff you don't usually see. I love the dumplings they have, which come with a lovely dip!. The staff are always so cool, too. One guy we had, who was serving our table of twelve, had a little trouble keeping the drinks straight but made up for it by bringing us a couple of free jugs. I'll let slide a couple of missed drinks for free jugs. . . anytime!. So, yeah!  That's why I love Brewsters in Crowfoot. It's a great place for family or friends!","I have found a hidden spot for terh BEEEESSSST ever pizza downtown inside the Plaza Hotel is Pop Up Pizza. . . . I highly recommend this place. . . . .","After doing a hiking meetup, we all came here for a pizza and some drinks. My hiking partner hesitated about staying for pizza, as he was gluten-free. However, after looking at the menu and asking the server, we discovered that they do in fact have gluten-free pizza. Yay!. I think there were about 15 of us, so it took awhile for everyone's food to come out. When our gluten-free pizza came, we dug right in. We were really hungry! Our pizza came with four toppings - garlic, mushrooms, chicken, and something else which I forgot. :) It was pretty good! My hiking partner encountered a green pepper on one of the slices though (not one of our toppings). The person next to us had a calzone and it was huge!. Overall I would say this place has A-OK gluten-free pizza. The wait for food can be a bit long though, particularly for a large party.","Enthusiastic and gracious staff. Check!. Convenient location in Summerlin. Check!. A unique pizza experience with premier variety of ingredients. Check!. Incentives to bring you back. Checkity check check.","Lucille has great ambience . This is 2nd time we've been there - first time was great. Last night pizza delivered almost burnt- no serving utensil for pizza; the waitress was on her phone in the back; never came to see if we needed anything ( like 2nd drink) and we had to flag her down to get bill and box for our burnt pizza . Too bad - cause I like the atmosphere- but my husband won't go back. If you get a good server than probably a good experience. We should have sent pizza back but we couldn't find our server.","My grandparents really like this place so I've come here a few times with them. I have to say, it's not really the best place I've eaten Italian but it's A-OK in my book. The lunch buffet is good and a pretty good deal. There's a salad bar with pizza and another buffet with pasta (6 different pasta sauces), chicken, veggies, all kinds of choices. On Friday's they have pierogies which I'm a huge fan of. . We also came here one year for Thanksgiving dinner. Most of our family wasn't going to be home for Thanksgiving and my mom didn't feel like cooking so we came here for the buffet. It was actually really good, we all left stuffed. . I told my mom she should roll me outta there, ha ha. . Anyways, don't come here expecting a gourmet meal. The food is good but not awesome. Their salad dressings however, are awesome. So if you're looking for a place to eat lunch with coworkers one day, Stancato's is cheap, has variety and will satisfy your pasta craving.","Fantastic pizza - thin, buttery crust,  not swimming in cheese or sauce! Speaking of sauce, theirs is a simple tomato sauce with seasoning added on top of the toppings. Made for some awesome bites - mild seasoning or simple sauce, or both - loved it!. Hubby and I shared their \"small\" Mediterranean salad. Excellent dressing, not overly seasoned,  letting the olives, tomatoes, cucumbers,  and red onions show thru with that yummy feta cheese!  Well done! . Plus,  hubby was happy, they serve Sierra Nevada!","To us this place has the best wings in the city. They're big, saucy(go for medium) and perfectly fried. Burgers and fries are delicious, pizza is so so, depending on the toppings. Great variety of beers on tap and their kegs have coolers so the beers are always freezing cold(nothing worse than a cool beer). Been going here for over ten years and the service has always been good. New owners have taken over recently and the newer staff has been just as great. . The decor is typical dated pub style but the atmosphere is friendly and cozy. They always have great drink specials, $2 Sambuca shots on most days, pricing in general is excellent. If your in east scarborough this is a great place to get loaded  for cheap and eat good food.","This place was not what I expected at all after reading all the amazing reviews. I had couple of friends in town who wanted to do Italian on the strip. I yelped a place and this came up and seemed perfect. First, it took us forever to find the place A pretty well hidden. Then, the place was in reality small, lots of light, and there wasn't anything special about it. We didn't really care - we were there for a good Italian meal and to catch up. . Five stars for service - the service was actually good and everyone was nice and courteous at all times. Five stars For the tiramisu as well. Even though I am not a tiramisu person at all but that was the table's choice I loved it. It comes in a glass and the tiramisu part is really only on the bottom - there's something like a vanilla pudding/creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e filling that was very tasty. . However, the food was ok. Just ok. Absolutely nothing special. We got couple of pizzas that were ok and my husband got the ny strip special ($60 meal) and described it as \"the worse steak\" he recently ate. For that kind of money you can get a real steak at a good steakhouse and go home happy. I did not completely hate the place but I will definitely not return.","From the minute I walked in the door I felt right at home. The staff was very accommodating and our waiter was friendly. We had the sampler which was excellent and the pizza was delicious. Will definitely be going back.","Perfect place for a casual lunch or a quick dinner after a day of shopping. It's nothing special, but it's comfortable, tasty and affordable. Uncomplicated, high quality pizza and salads. . . plus the lasagna is pretty good too.","Pizza is good! First time I ordered a pizza there everything was fine. The next time I ordered, was before the Mayweather/Paquiua fight, 2 Lg sausage/pepperoni pizzas, they charged me almost $60! I never, ever went back!","STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!    What an absolute joke! How this place could call themselves Manhattan Pizza is beyond me. To even attempt to associate themselves with the Pizza capital is false advertising. I would expect the Pizza chains to play the size game, but not someplace named after NY. Show me a place in NY where they have a 16\" pizza quoted as a \"Large\" for $12. 99? After a short argument with the owner he offered to make  me another 16\" for $10. 00. Really? $3 dollars in material and 10 minutes for $22? You should be ashamed! My original thought was he could have made a happy customer had he either cooked the size pizza I wanted originally, or offered me another for free. But when I got home and tasted this crap I realized that would have been a waste. This was hands down the worst pizza I have ever had EVER! I could have bought a frozen pizza for half the price and been more satisfied. Seriously, you can get a better pizza at Chuck E Cheese!","This is are home town pizza place they are great in a pinch and on the other side/ our side I the train tracks. Also have great coupons most of the time for parties. I like they are so close and there chicken and jo-Jo's are a must if you debating on adding to your pizza order. Deluxe pizza is my favorite!","After wading through clouds of cigarette smoke from their cooks/drivers standing out front and waiting for 15 minutes in the tacky dining room for my order that i called in an hour beforehand, finally got our pizza. Over all the taste was OK but def not worth the price. There's a million better pizza joints in Cleveland- dont waste your time/money here.","Great atmosphere. Good for just one or for groups. The food is delicious! Try the tomato caprice for a light health appetizer, it's a large enough portion to share! The margarita pizza is simple and full of flavor!! The oven roasted makes the world a difference with this pizza!!","Not really sure what they do here, but apparently it isn't make or deliver pizza!. Twice in a row I have ordered and then waited hours for a delivery that simply never arrives. When I call a manager isn't available and my pizza is \"out for delivery. \". This sucks. Spoke to Doug the GM last time this happened and he was apologetic and committed to it not happening again. Epic fail. . Order from Pizza Hut. They show up. . ---. Update - 2. 5 hours since ordering and still nothing. Literally second time in a row. . Christina is rude. She and the manager both get on the phone and claim nothing is their fault. What a joke!!!. Matin is a moron (manager). Said, \"I'm quitting this fucking job!\" . Then hung up on me. . What an experience. And still no pizza! WTF?!","Cant freakin wait to go back!!!. The hubby and I were looking for a good pizza place to try and this popped up on yelp nearby. . . SO we learned how it worked before we went in. . . . Basically you build your own pizza with unlimited toppings or none for the same price. One size, but its a big one, I couldn't finish one on my own. . We bought two: Diavola sauce, fresh and shredded mozzarella, chorizo, pepperoni, fresh basil, bell pepper. . . and the other was the stock Bianca. Both were amazing. Like I said, I can't wait to get more. A tad pricey, but hey, load it up with toppings and foul get what you pay for! See my photos of my pizzas, that were half gone, lol","Simple shop on Fremont street. The pizza is good, but nothing to rave about. You have evel pie and other shops for more to choose from. . This is perfect tourist food lol. Me as a local I pass here from time to time and grab a slice. Very odd because I was over charged twice there. They fixed it but still a little weird. . The staff is mostly broken English. Still usually very friendly. I have no problem coming back here from time to time because the prices are good and the pizza doesn't take long. If I was looking for a more intimate place I obviously wouldn't choose here. However for fair prices and good pizza it's perfect for tourists!!","I fell in luv w Grimaldi's during my visit to NY. . Unexpectedly, I found it here in Vegas! Olleh!. Let's try here in Vegas:). As usual, got L size pizza w extra cheese/pepperoni/mushroom and it was good (although not as much as its original NY location) . My main complaint was mozza cheese!. It wad supposed to be thick cheese layer for $2 topping as it mesmerized me in NY, but not really. . . . (You can judge it from my picture). Other than that, it is still awesome pizza!. Staff and manager were super kind during my pick-up as well. don't forget its $5 coupon from web:). All end up less than $20 after tax. (large pizza $18 / each topping $2)","The Original Nello's -- Established 1983 -- has been serving by far the best pizza. And it's not just the pizza, it's the whole menu. Salads with famous house dressing, Italian spaghetti and pasta, garlic bread with Italian \"Margarita\" pizza topping, sandwiches, oven baked barbecue chicken wings, and a selection of wine and craft beer. . Jack Salley. Mesa, AZ","I don't get it. To be fair, I've only had their pizza, while eatable, I would never go back. Its definitely a huge jump up from the Domino's &amp; Pizza Huts but not even close to a Spinato's Pizza (my favorite) or a Casanova Brothers Pizza, as far as chains go, I think NYPD is much better than this. I know I'm in the minority here &amp; I love pizza but just not Nello's.","I've been to both locations now and both are fairly busy - depending on what time you visit, of course!. On a Sunday afternoon, late lunch, the St. Clair W location was quite packed. A young male waiter with long hair and glasses spotted us and recognised that we wanted something quiet, so we were sat right next to the kitchen. At first, I thought it was weird, but he was right, it's actually the quietest table in the restaurant!  Feels kinda separate from the busyness upfront. . . until you hafta scoot around people to head downstairs to the washrooms.  ;). Ordered the grilled calamari, quite good.  (I would've preferred the breaded version, but I was *trying* to be healthy. )  And for main, the Primavera pizza ($14) was shared. Due to the toppings like sundried tomatoes &amp; olives, the pizza was on the saltier side, but still didn't feel too heavy because of the thin crust. . Aside from the really thin crust, what sets their pizza apart is also their CHEESE!  They use really good, chewy quality mozz, yum!!!. Service was very pleasant, mainly due to the waiter who seated us. His personality was very upbeat and understood my needs which added to the experience.","Very disappointed. They are good at appetizers and pizza. The salads are good. They should stop trying to make Italian food. The minestrone soup was horrible, it was all cheese and bread chunks. It did not even resemble minestrone soup. The chicken lazzania was basically an overcooked pasta Brick with tomato sauce on top. When we told out server, a he said was that is how they make it here.","Nice, tucked in find in Penn Trafford! . Great pizza, sweet sauce, and gluten free option available!. The owner is knowledgable on gluten free and cross contamination. . Atmosphere is cozy, rustic Italian. I adore this place!. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because they are a CASH ONLY restaurant. . Recommendation: gluten free Margarita pizza (Delish!!!!)","Soooo delish. Had the S. O. P. pizza and the flavors were great. Nothing on the pizza overpowered any of the other flavors, they went together splendidly. This pizza felt like comfort food. Yum Yum. Also had the antipasto board. Loved everything on it. Lastly, the spaghetti and meatballs. Oh lord. The meatballs were amazing and the pasta cooked to a perfect al dente. All in all, I would recommend this place.","Excellent pizza/wings with great customer service. The restaurant is nice and cozy with Jukebox selections at each booth which is unique.","Good and yummy but felt like it was missing something. Had a small margarita pizza + meat pizza and cheesy garlic bread. Loved the inside, small dining area with open/viewable kitchen so you know there's nothing sketchy going on with your food.","Sat at the bar-HUGE beer selection. The day was really cold so I wanted tea, Nice hot tea selection also. Tasty calamari. We added several things to an existing pizza so we got a yummy creation. Solid choice. Random but heads up no vegan cheese available.","Good location, The garage door patio bar Will be nice once the weather cools off. Place was quite warm. Meat and cheese board was, three pieces of bread not quite enough. Sicilian pizza was thick and cooked in timely manner unfortunately it was oversauced. Not quite sure if her return.","Its part of Station's Casino. Looks like the set up hasn't changed for years. There is the Pub, the pizza place and the Brewer Cafe. The sportsbook is pretty busy and the Pub bar tops are filled and its 3pm. Lots of parking.","Pop Up Pizza is New York style. If you're ordering by the slice, all the pies are pre-baked, then slices are heated in the oven to order. . We tried three different slices:  The Goodman (mozzarella, caramelized onions, roasted mushrooms, spinach + red potato), The 18b (classic marinara/mozzarella) and The White Chapel (a white pie with mozzarella, ricotta, roasted garlic oil and saut\u00e9ed spinach). . The two veggie slices were tasty with a great balance of flavors and textures. The cheese slice was fine, but I much preferred the cheese slices at Pizza Rock. . If you walk the Fremont Experience and exit out at The Plaza, Pop Up Pizza (located at the back of the casino) is a delightful find (and pizza's always a good way to curb the effects of late-night drinking!).","This place was nearby my house and I wanted to get a pizza. . . so there I went. Went inside and place was sorta busy. When I placed my order they said it was going to take 30 minutes or so for me to receive it. . . . I literally looked around the dining room and asked why. ??? They said they were busy. . . . . I did say it was sorta busy right and did for a reason. I ordered anyway and sat down. I have some patience and I wasn't going to a bar just yet. . . . give these guys a chance. Pizza came out about 35 minutes later and it looks pretty good. I ate a few slices and it was pretty tasty. The only thing that kept me from 4 stars was this. . . . . . . . . . 1. the wait. . . . snore. . . . . . 2. I wish the pizza had more meat on it. . . . . wheres the beef baby!!. 3. when you bite into the pizza the lip scorching cheese flap comes off and blister the daylights out of you lips and chin. . . . . . . I should've screamed in bloody horror! Consider this a warning and a public service announcement!. I ordered a small pizza and a drink and it was $18 bucks. . . . . . . compared to pizza hut that's expensive and I get 2 pizzas from the hut!","The pizza was allright. Honestly Lou malnati or even oregnoes deep dish is a better choice for deep dish pizza in Arizona. Not to say you shouldn't try it because it still is good. Just the other two options I gave are probably marginally better. My main complaint is the staff. We were there I believe at 840 and waited an hour to be seated. We did the pre order where we ordered before sitting so we wouldn't have to wait as long so the combined wait time was about 40 minutes to be seated and another twenty for the deep dish pizza. The place was slowing down and it was ten pm. Our food was done and our waiter kept coming back to our table saying have a good night. . . basically trying to kick us out. I understand if the place was busy but they had no wait or anything. The guy just repeatedly kept coming more agitated each time. It was just a bad show of customer service and was enough to sway me to other deep dish options.","It's close to home and the pizza is ok. That's the only thing that keeps us coming back. Also, switching from Rod's ranch to Ken's was a terrible idea.","We've waited well over an hour 1/2 for two medium pizzas that claimed to be in transit over an hour ago. Hopefully my food isn't cold when it gets here. . . if it ever does. Like what in the f. Should've listened to past yelpers, Jesus Christ","Really terrific menu. Steak, pasta, salads, seafood, pizza and more! Signature chipotle shrimp boat is to die for!  Great atmosphere, great friendly service, located in the heart of Beautiful North Scottsdale in Grayhawk.","The pizza is pretty good. they take special requests and the staff is very friendly. they do a mac n cheese pizza (yeah i know it sounds kinda weird) that is surprisingly good. pizza selection is good, thin crust, deep dish, veggie and meat are all up. salad bar is a little sparse but adequate. usually three selections for desert, apple/cream cheese pizza, brownies and cinnamon rolls.  if you can snag a couple fresh made cinnamon rolls you will not be disappointed. only drawback is they have coke products but they have tea. coupons abound, you will get an offer on the back of the receipt.","Wow is all I can say. I'm a total foodie and this place has so many unique dishes, I could eat here every week and try something new, knowing it will be amazing. I never order pizza when I go out to eat but their chicken and artichoke pizza is to die for. Oh, and don't get me started on the desserts! Portions are hefty. Great value for the price.","Medium rare ordered. . . . well done received. Disappointing for a $50 plus steak. I don't send food back to the kitchen, it frightens me. Slice of pizza will be ordered in a bit.","Believe the reviews!  This pizza is hands down no questions asked THE BOMB!!!!   Best tasting pizza in Las Vegas. That's a bold statement. Cheesey perfect crust with my pepperoni and sausage oh boy what a treat, side of ranch now I'm on cloud 9. Thank you Manhatten Pizza for my great tasting pizza and such fast service and gracious customer service. We will be back.","As a treat and deciding to be a lazy mom night I gave in and ordered a \"pizza hut pizza\" for the kids. I ordered two medium pizzas online with a coupon, no problems. Very easy to order. They called 10minutes before the \"estimated delivery time\" to confirm the address and said the pizzas will be there in the next 20 minutes. So after waiting half an hour at least I knew dinner would be here in the next 20 minutes. So 20 minutes came and went. An hour later our Luke warm pizzas arrived one of them were even right. The other had a different crust. They were the greasiest half assed pizzas I've ever seen. . If I could give this place zero stars I would.","Solid pizza place. But even better is that they are more than good pizza. They have great sub sandwiches and very good salads. It's our go to Pizza place. Fast and easy delivery.","Brick oven pizza was awesome. We're pretty selective about our pizza and BEVO really stands out. Service was attentive and friendly. Only complaint was that seating in the cool-looking section you see on the website was not open--more like a traditional pizza bar where we sat.","Love the happy hour - half off appies and $3 micro brew pints. Go for the pizza crust with cheese for $3. 25 - basically a deconstructed cheese pizza for 1/4 the price. Meat and cheese board is also great and very filling. Spring for the wood fired za (Shriners Pavone Pepperoni is a personal favorite), but don't come before 5pm as they will still be stoking the hardwood flames. I have a dream of someday locking down one of the 3 high top tables in the bar area, always taken by regulars that seem to live there. I have tried almost all the menu items and have yet to be disappointed. Service is always great - Cody is top notch, high energy and knows his brews. If Shaun White and the dude waiter from Chotchkie's (Office Space) had a baby, it would be him. . .","If there is a more perfect pizza, I do not know what it would consist of: Slice on Broadway provides a pie with a delicious crust, cheese, and sauce, and the tables include containers of grated cheese, pepper flakes, and fresh oregano. The staff is generally pleasant and accommodating and works well under pressure during busy times. At $17 for a large plain pizza including tax, the product is not overpriced and offers value by ballpark standards. The young gentleman who appears to be the manager is always welcoming and gracious to me and my companions. I miss Slice on Broadway during the Pirates offseason and the restaurant makes my visits to the ballpark much more enjoyable: bravo!","We came for a business trip to Glendale and stayed at the Renaissance Hotel in the West Gate area. My girlfriend was craving pizza and a caesar salad. Yelp helped to find this location within walking distance of our hotel. . Well she was super happy, the pizza was delicious and the cheese was great, we ordered the 16\" Mamas Supreme pizza. We have left overs for tomorrow. . !! Love cold left over cold pizza. ! Yum. ! . The salad was ok, I have had better butthe pizza was definitely worth coming for a return visit. . . . Service was great, the waiter attentive. . I gave this place 4 stars only because the sale was ok. !! It's ok, I think they can easily improve on the salads.","The kind of place I wish I had where I lived. The best gluten free pizza and regular pizza for that matter (I eat both both my spouse is gluten free) The charcuterie and cheese board was awesome too. Really everything we ate was amazing I including the salmon, lamb shank and roasted veggies. If only we had been able to grab a pizza for the road! This place is definitely a thumbs up and worth checking out if you're looking for a good meal in a cute, casual environment. If I lived in Cleveland, I'd become a regular here for sure!","The pizza was great but the guy that delivered didn't know how much it was. He asked me what the price was supposed to be and then added a bit. The guy on the phone was kinda weird too. I'm not sure what to think about it. I think this place could be amazing except for poor staffing choices.","Whenever we order pizza from here, it's always undercooked in the centre, all doughy and gross. They claim it's because too many toppings are put on but if you have a special for a large pizza with 5 topping for $12. 99, you should be able to cook a large pizza with 5 toppings properly.","I saw this place on a show on Food network. The guy went there for pizza and pasta and they featured (as far as i remember) Lobster pizza, lobster Pasta, and the Famous Banana split pizza. . We wanted to try it out so we drove from Downtown toronto. . We were 5 and on a saturday night, took about 20 min to sit down. We ordered three pizzas (including the lobster one) and one pasta (Salmon and Caviar). the pizzas were good, but nothing extraordinary. The lobster pizza was average. None of us was terribly impressed. The Salmon pasta was very good, i couldnt taste the caviar though. maybe it was more for the presentation as there was a dallop on there. I guess the cream sauce drowned the flavor. . Then we ordered the banana Split pizza, which comes with Brownies, pineapple nuts and whipped cream on top. That was something. Pretty good. unique dessert pizza. Must try.","Not much to say other than they serve the best pizza  in Stoughton. Great crust, sweet sauce and if you're willing to make your meal even less healthy, try dipping a slice in their homemade ranch dressing. Sounds a little gross, but it's not. . The staff is really laid back and friendly. Sometimes we joke that at times, they seem just as baked as they're pies, but they have never provided anything but exceptional service. . Other menus items are really good, and the garlic bread is soaked with butter and is wonderfully bad for you. But we don't really give the other items a chance because we like the pepperoni pizza so much.","This higher quality pizza place is great for an area full of chain restaurants. It is similar to MOD or 1000 Degrees. The pizzas are delicious, but a bit small for the price. I always take mine to go since the dining room is small and canget noisy and hectic. But overall, this is the best custom individual pizza in the area.","I got pickup from here this past Saturday evening. Whenever I called I was told that my 2 large pizzas would be ready in 15 minutes.  20 minutes later they were waiting for me whenever I arrived. The shop itself is a small place with very little customer space. Seeing how they do not have a dining area, this is not a problem. . The pizza tasted decently with nothing really standing out besides the large amount of cheese on the pizza which I enjoyed. So overall I was satisfied with it. . The bottom line for me is that I would come back here again. The pizza was decent and there was nothing bad to say about it.","My friends and I came here after a long night of drinking and dancing. Their pizza slices were huge (like the size of two pieces of pizza) and delicious. They were super friendly and gave us each a side of ranch. Hurrah for Benny's!","The food was good, I had a bbq chicken pizza on a califlower crust. Califlower buffalo bites and chicken tortilla soup. Everything was great other than the chicken tortilla soup. It was more of a paste like out of a bag and didn't taste well. Another thing was the price it cost me 17. 50 for just the pizza which I think is quite expensive. The service we got was decent but he did take a long time to to bring our check when I ask and run my card like over 10 minutes. I had my kids with me and to me as a server I would get it quicker than that. The food and service was not worth the price of most of the men. . Update on review CPK reached out to me on my review and they encouraged me to post a feedback about my experience to the website. So I did and the general manager of the chandler CPK called me. He looked into the issue and apologized. He stated he knows which waiter was it and will correct it so it doesn't happen again. He also stated that the chicken tortilla soup can get that way if it is not made right and should have not gone out that way. He was super nice and understanding about everything and offered for me to give them a second chance. He offered two free entrees. Today I went and got two califlower pizzas, one was bbq chicken and Thai peanut chicken and god they were amazing. I don't mind giving them a second chance and glad I did some times one experience doesn't define everything. The GM was great about it and he actually took my order when I went in today. . I gave them 2 out of 5 the first time and today they get a 5 Star","Went to Giordanos on a Sunday afternoon. We went early, because I heard that it can get pretty busy. . My first thought was that the inside looked really nice, but it also looked very small. . Aside from the size of the restaurant, everything else was great for us. We ordered a deep dish pie and was told it'd take about an hour to come out. We completely understood though. We are aware that deep dish pizza takes longer to cook. We anticipated the wait time. . You could definitely tell that the staff was new and possibly not too experienced. We had two other waiters try to drop someone else's food at our table. . After about 40 minutes of waiting, our pizza arrived. We were quite pleased at the wait time for the pizza. . The pizza was just as I remembered it from when I would visit Chicago. Absolutely delicious!. Our waitress was great. . I can see where improvements could be made, but I absolutely think they will be worked out with time. . We will definitely be back when we are on this side of town!","After reading the amazing reviews, I was so excited to try the pizza at Bottega!  Wow what a let down. The crust is soggy and undercooked (all 6 pizzas ordered) and the woman next to us sent hers back twice before giving up and leaving without eating.  . The arancini was disappointing &amp; dry and didn't come with any marinara. The bacia was bland. . Great bright decor for a lunch spot but the pizza is just so bad, who cares?!  And this is not just my personal opinion, the tables on both sides of me were also complaining of soggy pizzas!","Delivery guy was great, pizza looked great but honestly the taste wasn't there, kind of cardboard tasting dough. Pizza was supposed to be pepperoni and sausage but ended up being two types of sausage, the delivery of the pizza and employees were good though. Don't think I'll order from here again so 3. 5","Best New York pizza in Vegas! Drove from the strip to try it after a recent recommendation and it was worth it.","This place has a great atmosphere &amp; friendly service with delicious pizza. The only drawback is that they are VERY slow even when the restaurant is only a 1/3 full. Otherwise, we would have given it 5 stars. Don't come here unless you have time to relax &amp; wait. We waited almost an hour for 1 pizza.","This place was great! Service with a genuine smile and delicious food! The Tortilini D'Angelo is a must. The pizza was fresh and tasty. We will definitely be back next time we're in the area as we were visiting  from  Los Angeles :)","The Saturday and Sunday brunch is a MUST at Hob Nob! . Your choice of bottomless mimosas or bloody marrys for $6. 99/7. 99, plus a large menu of brunch options (including a breakfast pizza that is amazing) or a make your own omelet bar. All breakfast options are very inexpensive. Bagel, lox and fixins is only $5. 95! It's 12 bucks at Panera! . And bonus, there's relaxing, live, brunch music often. . Be sure to finish up with one of their in-house made desserts.","Moved here not too long ago. Was going to order me up some pizza. After reading all the bad reviews I've decided NOT to order from this location. Decided to try Dominos although I prefer PJP, at least I did back where I used to live. PJP, are you listening.","Had a great hot pepper pizza. Went with my Italian girlfriend and mother, they said it's their favorite place to eat their native food &amp; they \"are always here\". Service was good, had enough food for leftover lunch tomorrow. Good atmosphere!","They have good pizza but, most of Thier food with exception to the pasta and salad, is pre-prepared ! Service is good. . Tom Dean. Hudson, Ohio","The best thing for me about the pizza at Char is that garlic is a topping and not in the tomato sauce. Having a garlic allergy pretty much eliminates having a good pizza, so very glad we tried Char. . There are basic pizzas such as marguerite and cheese, costing $8. 99 for six slices ($2 off on Tuesday) and speciality pizzas. From there you can add toppings for $1 each. You order at a long counter as they build the pizza for you. Upon paying you receive a number. The pizza is brought to your table. . Hubby had the marguerite with pepperoni. I enjoyed a cheese pizza with olives and mushrooms. Pizza was delivered piping hot to our table. . We wish that the crust was crispier, it was difficult to cut with the restaurant poor quality silverware. That is pretty much the only drawback. . We left happy and with a pizza box of leftovers. Will definitely try again. . Our total tab with two pizzas, two drinks and tip was $29","Ordered 18 in pizza, half sausage, half pepperoni, pizza was fantastic. No shortage of toppings on pizza. Being from NY, I am really picky about my pizza. Pizza tasted like it came from New York. Which is great because I can't stand pizzas that come from franchises those pizzas all taste like cheese and sauce on a cracker. Also picked up a cannoli while I was there it was delicious fantastic just like I remember from the Italian bakeries back east. Will definitely only go to this place for my pizzas and my cannolis.","Great location. Ordered six pizzas on a busy Saturday and was delivered in under 45 minutes. Great staff and delicious pizza.","Their pizza gave me FOOD POISONING. . . TWICE! I though maybe I had a stomach bug the first time. The second time, I had to take off work the next day because I was so sick. NOT OK!!  I should have known. The employees hands looked filthy and the place was like 100 degrees inside. Pizza places use raw meat for sausage, so if the meat is sitting out in a hot kitchen for hours before it even goes on your food. . . well you do the math.","Three times a charm? Not at this location! First time in, customer service was terrible. The two girls taking orders at the counter complained the entire time about how swamped their were on a Tuesday night and didn't even greet us when we came in. . Second time was a little better, but they change the style of their fried mushrooms than it was the first time we had them. . Last time I will go there was last night unless their management changes. I have ordered the pizza and wing special, extra large with two toppings and a side order of fried mushrooms, 30 bucks. This time I just ordered the special extra large two topping pizza with wings with no side of fried mushrooms, price 30 bucks. It didn't make sense to me and I asked the girl working the counter, who was really sweet, how can it be the same price if I didn't order the extra items of mushrooms, she couldn't figure it put. A older man with a white mustache tried to justify the price by saying he put extra wings in my order, which he lied about. I told him the math didn't add up and he proceeded to get mouthy with me telling me, as I am walking out the door, to give him the pizza back. . I am all about supporting local business but this manager needs to learn math and customer service. I will not be back anytime soon!","Do not get the spinach and artichoke dip. Do get a burger. An amazingly delicious - quite possibly one of the best burgers you'll ever have in Pittsburgh - burger. . I mean, that pretty much sums up all that needs to be said about Wingharts. The south side location has that dark, south side bar type feel to it - exposed  brick and dark wood tables - nice beer selection. . The 'Market Square Burger' was a great choice - bacon, mushrooms and gruyere, a winning combo - and cooked to perfection. The meat itself was juicy and flavorful - yum. Fries come a la carte and one order is enough for two or three people - seasoned and crispy good! The pepperoni roll app was great - the spinach and artichoke dip, not so great. . Went with a party of five - it did take some time for the burgers to come out, but it was well worth the wait. . Heard they have great pizza, too - can't wait to try it! Maybe I'll visit the Market Square location next. :-)","This pizza is the bomb!  We bought one pizza on the first night we were at the golden nugget. . Ate it for breakfast and lunch. It was even better on the left over side. For anyone trying to be frugal or wanting to have multiple meals. Come to the plaza. Hit up Pop up Pizza and the hashish a go go","First time ordering from this place. Never again! I ordered a large thin crust pizza and 6 med wings. Pizza had big, black burnt bubbles on top, along with burnt pepperoni. Wings were okay. . Very long delivery time. Wouldn't recommend","This place was Ssssooooo close to getting one star. So close. I've had Korean bbq in several bigs cities - Chi-town, NYC, ATL. . . I may not be Korean but I'm a pretty good judge of food so i know good Korean BBQ. The risk of one star had absolutely nothing to do with the food or waitstaff - it's all due to the seating arranged by the hostess. . Came here on a Friday night around 5:30 with a party of 14. We were told It would be 40-45 min wait. The hostess pointed out two tables in the front and said that would be ours. We put down our name and headed next door to Seoul for beers while we wait. 30 min later, we check with the hostess and was told it's another 40 min wait again. No reasoning, no explanation. We glanced over at the tables that were supposed to be ours and noticed there's two new sets of customers seated there. Wait - did you just give our tables to someone else? And failed to update us? When we realized that, we went back to the hostess and was told those two tables couldn't accommodate 14 people so they had to change the plan. I was beyond livid. Why were we told one thing and not updated when the plan changed? At this point it's been an hour and a half wait. I don't mind waiting but when you're told 40 min and it's been 90 min, something's gotta give. Because we already invested so much time - not to mention we're here to celebrate my 18 year wedding anniversary - we decided to continue to wait. Luckily our name was called about 5 min after the showdown with the hostess. . We get to our seat and it's three tables. Our friends visiting from MN were on the opposite side so there was absolutely no interaction with them during the meal. Another negative. . Now on to the food. As soon as we sat down, someone came by to take drink orders and the ban chan (side dishes) were dropped off. Before our waters were even given, another person (our waiter) came by to take our food orders and It went uphill from there. I'm talking from a 1 star to a full 5 stars right away. . All of the side dishes were delicious. The meats were so flavorful- definitely the best bulgolgi I've ever had. Packed with flavor. The dipping sauces were plentiful and on point. Try the corn cheese. I know It sounds weird but there's something about gooey mozzarella cheese melted over sweet corn that paired together so well. Who would've thunk It? My 10 year old nephew has to be the pickiest eater alive. He eats a total of 6 things in the world- rice and chicken, rice and eggs, pizza, nachos, cheeseburger and nuggets with fries. That's It. I was not looking forward to paying $12 for nothing but surprisingly, I gave him chunks of pork belly crisped up on the grill over a bowl of rice and he rated It 10 out of 10. That's saying a lot!!! . Let's talk about the service for a minute. Can I give them 5 stars too? I mean, my table consisted of 6 people, 3 of which we're guys over 200 lbs each. And we stayed taken care of. Ask for more rice? You get it right away. You didn't even have to ask for drink refills, you automatically get a glass that's kept full. No matter how many times we asked for additional items, everyone stayed friendly and obliging. Our waitress Camilla must be an angel sent from heaven cause she put up with our neediness with a smile fixed on her face. Gratuity was included in our bill but each of our three tables gave more tips on top of It because our wait staff was impeccable. Then at the end of our meal, the manager or owner walked around and talked to us. Man I wish every place was like this. They have seriously ruined me for customer service anywhere else. All in all, even though we had issues with the hostess and the wait time, we will definitely be regulars here. Just not with a large party again. . Thank you Let's Meat for putting Charlotte on the map when It comes to Korean bbq. You did not disappoint!","This is one of my favorite places to drink and dine. The owners are lovely people who promote local artists and care about their customers. The wait staff is very friendly, know the menu and can make great recommendations. The Fairmount has one of the best patios in Cleveland Heights and is a great place to either relax or host an event. The drinks menu is robust. I recommend the grilled romaine salad for lighter fare and the Bloody Mary's are fantastic. Also, try the pizzas. Delicious.","Great pizza and wings. Service sometimes a little slow but most of times not to bad. High priced so I cant give 5 stars. Attractive wait staff. .","Alone in my dark apartment, having worn my 3 Wolf Moon T-Shirt as well for countless weeks, found this restaurant to be my heaven. I entered the restaurant, looking at the menu of this restaurant, deciding what would satisfy my hunger. Always pilling up the pizza boxes, leaving some greasy Chinese food in the kitchen, I was beginning to get tired of the food. I recently lost my job as a Custodial Consultant for sniffing the amonia in the utility closet. My funding for my gourmet meals from such world reknown chefs as Boyardi and Uncle Ben had begun running low. Stumbling in a drunken daze through the local building, my legs carelessly walked inside of the restaurant. As I looked closely, I saw the name of the restaurant, \"Sushi &amp; Rolls. \" . Curiously, I glanced at the menu and decided to grab a food. As I began glancing at the menu, the cashier (very pretty and nice but seems tough) named some popular meals. Naming the popular meals including sushi and Korean food, I began to realize that this was no ordinary restaurant. No my friends, this was a restaurants passed down from the Gods themselves, displaying the infinite beauty of their messenger cashier and Korean beautiful and loving couple in the restaurant. Not just displaying the beauty, but also giving the full taste of the food. I ordered Teriyaki Chicken along with Korean Spicy Pork. I knew at that moment, that these meals would change my life. I put a big spoonful of food in my mouth. What is my review of the food? Because of this restaurant, I now feel like living. I finally realize the world is beautiful and it is covered with beauty and taste. Tonkatsu? California Roll? Korean food? Its all in here. Not only do you never need to go to another restaurant, there will never be a restaurant so deliciously cooked ever again. From that point, I have divided my life into two different categories, life before Sushi &amp; Rolls and life after, much like the Old and New Testament. . From this restaurant I have made more friends than I can count, gained 30 pounds of rock hard muscle, and have a new job as VP of a major financial holdings company. This restaurant worked for me, and I am sure it will work for you.","The tuna pizza was a thin and crispy taste explosion. I ate more than my share. Everything at Morimoto was pretty much perfect, especially the sushi.  . For main we enjoyed the angry chicken and the pork and apple. Far too much food for two people, but we had to try some of the best this fine establishment could offer.  . For the finale, you must order the fiery chocolate bomb. It melts to marshmallow perfection, while you drool. Beautifully crafted cocktails round off the wonderful experience.","My family &amp; I kind of just stumbled across this gem in the Venetian Hotel. Unfortunately, half their seating sits right out in the pathway of walkers through the shopping area. But the food atop of the diner's plates was too alluring. We sat inside (which is pretty cramped). Our waiter was pleasant and attentive. He brought us their complimentary Garlic Knots. While on the greasy side, they were awesome!  As an appetizer, my family and I ordered the Fried Calamari. This could have been a meal for one. Luckily we shared it. Unfortunatley, it was a bit too fried. The sauce that accompanied the Calamari was good, but I wouldn't have minded had it been spicier. We ordered two personal pizzas to share. Although the pizzas are thin, they are large in diameter and declicious. We ordered a Margarita pizza and a Prosciutto pizza. While the Margarita was good, the Prosciutto pizza was excellent. . Overall, our experience was very good. The food was plentiful and very tasty. The staff was cordial. Endulge on the Garlic Knots and pizzas.","So the first time I came here I was really impressed with the pizza. They inform you that the crust is well done meaning that the outside is slightly burn because of the oven its cooked in. I didn't mind this seeing that the crust taste amazing all by itself. My favorite dish however are the meatballs served with focaccia bread. . The meatball is tender and just falls apart in your mouth and the red sauce that comes with it is just as good. The bread is warm and fluffy with a slight crisp topped with parmesan cheese and oregano. They also serve the with a side of soft ricotta cheese for dipping. . We ordered a large traditional pie and the toppings are $3 each and $2 after the first topping. That's pretty expensive seeing that you can pick another pie with several toppings for only $4 more. We did however find out that mushrooms and pepperoni's count as 1 topping so that was a plus. . They serve about 12 drafts and I went with a yards brawler which ahas in a 12 oz glass but it cost $5. 50. Again that's a little much. After order a large meatball (4 meatballs), a large pie with shrooms and pepperoni and my beer. Our total bill was $45. Not the kind of price I wanna pay for pizza so I will only visit this place every now and then. . I think the overpriced pie is due to it's location and the fact that they are way over staffed. For the small crowd of 20 people, most of them at the bar, they had about 10 waiters and 7 of them were just hanging around talking. Not the best look for a restaurant.","Stopped in to order a White pizza after shopping. Do I did not order ahead. First time there, wasn't a menu posted to see what options were. . . Ordered the White pizza almost 30 minute wait and was unimpressed with the pizza. Thin and no flavor.","I have been twice. First time was great. Love the salsa bar and the first event was pretty good and a nice atmosphere for a quickie.   . The customers are a little annoying quibbling at the sign and taking 'forever' to order so they can pretend they are so health conscious while eating their Mexican feast. But that's nothing to do with the restaurant so let me stick to the facts. Chicken burrito was great. Not really better than Caf\u00e9 Rio if putting them side by side. Perhaps it's true it's healthier. Meal options come with organic items and brown rice, etc. Second time visiting Sharky's, I had a chicken quesadilla which is heavily why I give this place a 3 stars. Tasty but \"where's the beef?!\" or rather \"where's the chicken?\". Presentation wise, it looked to be a good portion but the chicken was filled only in about half of the tortilla and the rest was not worth eating so basically half of the order/entre was an empty tortilla with a little cheese. Not being a huge eater, I left hungry and hoping I had something at home to eat.   :(  I did see people eating nachos and large Mexican style pizza that looked great and large portions so maybe I try that next time. I will give it another shot.","Super rude driver at 12pm on 7/15. I doubt you were 'calling me six times' since I was on top of my phone bc I was starving sir. Let's not try to make excuses- this restaurant is under a mile away. *cold pizza* *thanks for just waiting in your car* *come to the door sir*","I love these guys!. When I moved to my new neighborhood, the nearest Dominos location (my usual go-to company for delivery pizza) was having troubles with their connectivity to the online ordering system, and I HATE ordering by phone, because I prefer to look over the 'coupons' and order something that way, rather than spending $20 or so per pizza. So, I was looking for a substitute, and after being thoroughly disappointed with Pizza 73, I decided to give these guys a shot. . Their prices were about comparable with the other big chains, for pizza that is MUCH better than 73 (I'm torn whether I like theirs or Domino's better). What really sold me though was the service. The online system estimated 45-50 minutes which seemed like a lot for me (in my old neighborhood it was usually more like 25-30), but was the same as any of the other places. . . however, my delivery guy was there 20 minutes earlier than projected, and still APOLOGIZED for taking so long, and came equipped with paper plates, napkins, and a free fridge magnet (none of which I've ever seen from anywhere else) in addition to the customary menu/coupon card. He also asked if I'd ordered from them before (I think they must have some kind of record of new customers) and when I mentioned I hadn't, he gave me an extra little business card good for a free side dish with my next order. Every single time I've ordered from them I've had a friendly, smiling delivery guy (who could actually speak english, which is a big plus in my books!), always gotten the plates, napkins and magnets (even though I now have far more of the latter than I'd ever need) and have never ONCE had any issues with my order. . All in all, I flip between these guys and Dominos when I order now, but if you haven't tried these guys out, I would definitely suggest it. This location especially is run great and has never let me down.","Being from New York, I'd say I know a thing or two about pizza. So when I say this place has a decent New York style slice, it should count for something. . The vegan pizza was so satisfying and \"cheesy\". The white pizza was equally good. I would not recommend the garlic parm fries to anyone with any hopes of getting lucky. It is that potent and no one will want to breath near you. . I was slightly disappointed that their soft serve machine wasn't working. I could have used a cup of vegan ice cream.","Once a favorite the last five or so times yielded less than stellar results and can't say at this point it's a fluke. I always brought my pizza home and put it in the oven for added crisp which makes all the difference. The one time I ate in it was not at all good. And the last few times I ordered it was downright awful. Seems something definitely changed in the kitchen.","First time there and the wings and pizza were excellent the waitress was also very nice and patient with us will definitely go back .","My boyfriend and I had a decent experience here. The pizza and salad were very good. Service was good and it was a Sunday afternoon and they had live music on the patio. We were driving arrive trying to find a new place and we were pleasantly surprised. We will be back!","Pizza here reminds me of Angelos but is somewhat inconsistent. Some days it's way better than other times. Would recommend the extra cheese because sometimes it's a little lacking. Sometimes the larger sizes pizzas aren't cooked enough. Overall usually great quality. The prices are a bit over priced for a regular pizza place though. Even with coupon expect to pay a lot. Wish they would have cheaper deals.","Love this place. Lots of great healthy (and veggie) options. I've had several of their pizzas and an awesome roasted veggie salad. Great service. Only con is a tad pricey.","I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza to go and when I got home I instantly noticed a large strand of hair on my pizza. Some things I can forgive, but this I can't. The staff seemed friendly, but even the pizza doesn't taste very good so I can't really justify a higher rating. I won't be coming back.","This is the worst slice of pizza I've had. The man working heated it up in the microwave and If i wasn't half way through paying I would have left. I believe he was heating up his own TV dinner simultaneously because he sat down to eat it as soon as I left. There were left over pieces of trash on each table. My microwave pizza was gross and friggin chewy.","Really hard to rate food considering our pizza never made it to our table. On a Thursday night entered an almost empty restaurant, just a couple of teenagers finishing up. Placed our order at 7:40p (2 pepperoni pizzas), another family arrives 15 mins later places an order and receives their pizza. I finally get the attention of the waitress who seems to be avoiding our area and tells me 5-7 min more. That time passes and we're at 45 min without food and no response other than they had a lot of box orders to fill. What? Then how did the other family get their order and finish by 8:30? We finally talk to the manager, basically a kid without a clue. We leave after an hour without eating and rejecting a $15 off coupon to a restaurant where we can't get served.","We ate here for a friend's birthday before a show at the Overture Center. All around the food and drinks were excellent. We ordered a deep dish pepperoni and two thin-crust pizzas. All were excellent. Drinks were as good as Merchant (same owners). This is definitely an A-list restaurant in its category. The space itself is unique and interesting. . Service was friendly and efficient. Atmosphere was a bit loud and very dark (we sat upstairs). It was difficult to read the menus - this was the first time I used my mobile phone to light my menu! And I am not at the bifocal/bright light age yet!","Ok, my boyfriend and I are somewhat pizza snobs and since moving to Charlotte we've tried Fuel, Hawthorne's, Pizza Peel. . . all disappointments. . New York Pizza is the best so far. Located in a strip mall on South Boulevard, it has a no-nonsense feel complete with mounted paper towel rolls and a diverse clientele. The staff is always friendly and the pizza is delicious. . Lilly's Pizza in Raleigh is still my favorite, but New York is a close second.","Horrible! I called to place an order over the phone for pick up and the girl was terrible. She put me on hold and then picked up six or seven times to talk to me, but then kept placing me on hold. I was told my pizza would take 20-25 mins. I got to East West Pizza 25 minutes after placing my order and was told that it would take another 30 minutes from the time I paid for it. From the time I placed my order to the time I walked out of the restaurant it was over an hour. I thought this pizza better be great considering how long I waited for it and how much I paid for it (it was $18 for a large with two toppings). I took it home and ate it and threw more then half of it away. It was not good at all! Their toppings are very bland. There is nothing special about this pizza at all. It is obviously from all frozen products. They brag about their cheese on the top of the box and it is tasteless and disgusting! I would never go back!! If I could give them negative stars I would. Do not go to East West Pizza. Go to Grimaldis or something. It is not worth the $18 I paid or the hour I waited!!!","This was another of my usual go to places before leaving Calgary a several years ago. Since returning to Calgary I've noticed this trend across many formerly fantastic places where people are willing to pay significantly more, for significantly smaller portions, terrible quality and questionable service.  . The wife and I ate here on a Saturday night around 6:30pm. When I pulled up the parking lot was empty. The place looked closed. I figured there was no way a restaurant like Nick's would be closed at that time and day. Sure enough, not closed. . We were stood at the front desk trying to flag someone down for a little over 5 minutes, before some encouraging signs of life emerged and seated us. Service was extremely slow and unpleasant, but we endured and ordered our food. I ordered a steak, and the wife a chicken parmigiana. . What was served was disappointing. The portion sizes were pathetic. My steak was done in 4 bites. The wife's dish was even smaller of a portion, and her steamed veggies were 100% raw. For $23 and $32 plates this was laughable. Although they tasted fine, aside from being served raw veggies.  . At this point we noticed our waiter's friends had come in and they were sitting at another table with him joining their party. We didn't see him again. Finally we just went to the front counter to pay for our meal and left. . Nick's is a pizza house, I may give the pizza another go before I decide not to go back but I won't be returning for anything other than pizza.","Tried this place on a whim while in the area as my kids really wanted pizza. We were seated quickly and ordered a Margherita pizza right away for the kids. The pizza was fresh and cooked well and arrived quickly. My husband also ordered pizza and I ordered the fettuccine with bolognese sauce. The pasta was cooked to perfection and tasted homemade. The sauce was average out of any Italian restaurant in the area. Nothing to write home about but nothing really spectacular either. My only complaint was the serving size of the pasta. It was the size of an appetizer serving. For the cost (about $17),  I expected a larger portion. The waiter also brought fresh bread and a few different dips. This was a nice touch. Unfortunately,  after the food being served,  we never saw him again except to bring the bill. Our water was not re-filled even once in the duration of the meal. The place was almost dead too,  with only one other table of customers. Overall,  good pizza but staff could be more attentive and pasta portions could be more generous. I won't say that I'll never go back but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again.","Tony's Pizza is located in the heart of the Historic Business District off Nevada Way. Today when I attended the 54th Annual Art in the Park Festival, I paused here for a quick and inexpensive bite to eat. . The prices at Tony's Pizza in comparison with the food concessions at Art in the Park was reasonable. They offer specials including two slices with a large Coke for $6; or a slice of pizza with fries, and a large Coke for $6. 50. I chose the two slice special. . In contrast to the neighboring Milo's Cellar, Coffee Cup, and Art in the Park ; Tony's Pizza was nearly empty. There was zero effort finding a table in the small restaurant. I chose the table closest to the Coke machine. If I had chosen a few tables down, I'd be overlooking historic Nevada Street. Regardless, a few minutes later I was overlooking two slices of pizza. . The two slices of pizza were decent. I wouldn't go out of my way for this pizza, but if it is in my way in the heart of Historic Boulder City while my appetite is acting like a monkey pounding on my back, I might return here.","The pizza was delicious and staff was outgoing anytime I go back to Vegas this will be my go to spot","not the best pizza in the world, but not the torture chamber many our describing on Yelp. . lol. The pizza is very greasy and it feels almost undercooked most of the time, I am usually faded beyond belief whenever I eat at Gus's otherwise I would make a more logical decision never to come here. So if your just that wasted and need to consume some food before AM, come here and full up. Its convenient AF so I can't complain, but its pretty Shitty pizza smh.","Little Italian sidewalk cafe (plus interior restaurant) that is non pretentious simple yet offering excellent Italian fare. I came here with two friends and we were feeling like some light pizza as a snack to fill our hungry stomachs. So we decided to sit in the sidewalk terrace seating. We ordered in two delicious pizzas. One Quattro staggioni (four different toppings) and one of sausage, mushroom and olive. Both were very thin crust and really light yet tasty. On the table was some really good hot chilli oil. The server mentioned to me the family matriarch makes a huge batch one a year. It was all very tasty. To wash it down I started with a iced cappuccino which was creamy and very easy drinking. This area of little Italy is a great place to side and watch the world walk by. Great on a lazy weekend day. Sometimes I wonder why I don't do this more as it's a great pace of life. . Definitely a simple yet fulfilling restaurant. Service was friendly and efficient. Sure there are lots of options in LI but cafe Epoca served our purpose well and I'd come enjoy the pizza again!","I stayed at the Aria and had the pizza twice, I had the Gotham, it had pepperoni, sausage and some other types of meat, very delicious. Its a brick oven style pizza. nice, chewy crust, sauce had awesome flavor.","I had seen the emails stating there were changes to the local Sweet Tomatoes, yet I was surprised when we pulled into the parking lot at dinner time and saw no cars. . The food tasted good, but if you are a fan of Sweet Tomatoes, you will be disappointed to see many favorites gone. No more blueberry muffins, minimal choices on soups, no chili unless you buy it ala cart. My children were disappointed to see no more brownies and pizza, and no toppings for their frozen yogurt. . They had very little signage on ingredients. As a vegetarian, I found it very difficult to determine beyond the vegetables what was vegetarian or not. They had some pasta and cous cous salads but it was tough to determine the ingredients. They no longer had the potato bar and the vegan margarine. They did have some additional ingredients in the salad bar (or at least that I may have not noticed before), mixed bell peppers, some seeds (chia seeds?), and dehydrated cranberries. . The shopping ala cart is just not a good experience. If I had gone to this restaurant not expecting Sweet Tomatoes perhaps it would warrant more stars. Unfortunately, by branding it as a Sweet Tomatoes Field Kitchen you go in expecting a Sweet Tomatoes experience. You do not get it here. . We were not told of the $50 fee for losing the card, as other reviewers mentioned. They gave us a card for each person in our group so I don't know how they would even know if we lost a card when we went to check out. . Would I go back? If someone else wanted to go, I'd go with them and I'd eat and be content. But, I don't see myself being a regular any more, nor would I expect to go with my kids. As others have stated, this was a kid-requested place for birthday dinners and family nights out. It was a great place that had something for everyone.  . I hope that Sweet Tomatoes does not convert its other Phoenix restaurants to this \"concept, \" though our next closest Sweet Tomatoes is now about 50 minutes away. Bye bye Sweet Tomatoes. You will be missed. :-(","Alright, pizza is nothing special, but this store has a nasty smell to it, like something is rotten. Smells like fish and grey water. . .","In my opinion, the best hand tossed thin crust pizza in Pittsburgh. The wings are awesome if you like them crispy and sauce on the side like I do. Hoagies are awesome too. Everyone working is always friendly when myself and coworkers stop by for lunch. They also have a nice little patio area in the back that's quiet and almost makes me forget I'm in the city.","This place is super solid. Awesome Neapolitan style pizza, paninis, salads, appetizers and desserts. Nice and cheap too. It's in my neighborhood. Go eat there, so it stays in business and I can eat there too!","This is my 3rd time here and just as pleased as the first time. Margherita pizza at 15$ or so is great and the Brooklyn Lager (which apparently is from a brewery in Brooklyn) was pretty good too. They have an indoor heated patio where you can get the sun rays in the fall/winter.","Horrible customer service! Called for delivery to crescent heights. . .  it clearly states on their menu they deliver to this area. Was told my address was pushing the limits and not even given an option to pay more for a delivery fee (which I happily would've done if I had been treated nicer !). . I Google mapped it after the phone call and it was 3. 1 km and a 7 min drive! Guess the 0. 1 over their limit is too much for them  !! . Obviously this place does not care to bring more revenue to their business. Doesnt matter how good your pizza is supposed to be If u continue to treat customers like this !","Went here for dinner at 6:30 on a Tuesday night and they were busy. They said 25 min wait but it turned out to only be a 5 min wait. Nice!! Service was awesome! Food was amazing!! It is a pizza place- OMG the pizza was amazing and soooooo yummy. BEWARE - HUGE serving sizes. Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!!","We ordered 2 brick oven pizzas, Arugula salad and a cheese plate. Perfect amount of food for 2 adults and 2 teen daughters. All was tasty. Service a little slow But that was ok since we are in no hurry on vacation.","Love this little local pizza spot. The staff is super friendly and the food is good! I would totally recommend Fox's Pizza Den if you are going to be in the Waxhaw area.","Let me tell you something about this little gem off Fort Apache and Trop. It's one of about 10 restaurants in a strip mall, very nice inside except for one thing: There was not one single person inside eating. Don't let this place go unnoticed! I don't give out many 5 stars, let alone for pizza, but their pies are fantastic. . 3 types of crust to choose from, traditional New York hand tossed, a thin crust and a hybrid crust they call hand tossed thin, kind of a mix of the other two. Sauce is boss, and it was quite tasty, good cheese, not overly greasy and an abundance of topping choices. . The wings were also fantastic. We got the 'medium' heat level and and they were seasoned differently than the the typical buffalo (which really isn't my favorite anyway), not sure how to describe it but they were damn good. . The true test was bringing the pies home and seeing what everyone else thought. . . all 6 of us thought it was some of the best pizza around.","We have been here a few times for bowling and have had the pizza at pizini a couple of times. The bowling is great. The price is reasonable and my kids love it. They charge you for the lane by the hour with up to 6 bowlers and the bumpers automatically go up for the kids (designated when you pay). I really like the pizza. It's cooked in a wood fire oven so the crust is crisp and chewy. Plus I think it's reasonably priced. I've also had the fried zucchini, wings, and onion rings, all of which were good. The only thing I do not like is how much they charge for the arcade games (around $1 per game). It adds up quick when you have little kids who want to try everything. We also tried the goofy golf once but probably won't do that again as our kids are a little too young and really didn't get it. Overall we like this place and will keep coming back for the bowling and pizza.","This has become our go to place for hoagies and pizza, both sit down and delivery. Try the wedding soup too. . Also, they always have an interesting selection of draft and bottled beers. . Friendly wait staff. Lots of regulars at the bars. Plenty of TVs everywhere for sports.","Parma Tavern every Monday night for Cleveland Awesome Trivia. Good bar food - meatball subs, pizza, chicken sandwiches, etc. Love our regular server - Jeannie rocks! Lots of TVs, patio, good time!","Everything I've tried here is so, so good. Their mozzarella is really incredible. In addition to my margherita pizza I had some graham cracker cake (pictured) for dessert, which was also delicious. More like a mousse than cake, but who cares? Even the moscato was well above average. The prices are reasonable too, so I'm a big fan all around!","Best pizza in town so far. Been here 12 years. Friendly staff. Definitely enjoy pizza by the slice better than the whole pie. My whole family loves this place. Three kids and wife taste tested a few times with competitors on the street. Aiello's always won. Took a little bit to adjust to this style of pizza, but now we all crave it. Delicious!!","Ordered a large Chicken Parm and it showed up dry and crispy. As if I had paid $25. 00 for a Great Value box pizza. I called and asked if I could have it replaced and that I would gladly return the old one. The woman I talked to on the phone was polite, the manager on the other hand was not. Not only did he argue with me on whether or not he personally put sauce on the pizza but he made it out of his way to make me feel inconvenient. From a frequent visitor, it makes me apprehensive to order again , especially when the manager doesn't have time for me.","Great food, service and great value. We had just returned from Italy, and so we were looking forward to comparing the Italian and Canadian versions of typical Italian food. Vivoli won hands down!  Try the calamari to start, along with any of the salads and you will not be disappointed, . The pizza was delicious  and we shared a couple of pasta dishes that were \"to die for:\"  Highly recommend this restaurant. Decor is basic comfortable, and they have lots of outside seating, including a rooftop seating area.","The pizza is always crispy and good, definitely recommend the fire and brimstone with a fried egg. Can't go wrong with any of the salad options either. Try the pita with homemade hummus with the tabouli OMG! My new favorite place to eat.","Not sure why people like it so much. It's okay pizza, at a high price. Actually, that's unfair, since I've only tried them at two festivals, so maybe their rates were higher due to that. I'll update my review next time I try them out. But the festival was expensive for 2 small pieces. Wasn't worth it.","AWESOME aewsome flatbread pizza's! Came here as a stop on the walking foodtour of NoDa and Heist was EASILY my favorite stop of all. . The owner is a young entrepreneur who hails from NH and has a great story to tell. He's a beer lover, good food lover and very passionate about his business. Everyone should love what they do THIS much! . We tried some of their craft beer and house-made soda's - both delicious and unique. But what I loved most were the 3 kinds of flatbread's we got to try. . I was surpsised that as a meat lover, my favorite pizza was actually vegetarian. Kale, cheese and PERFECTLY roasted tomatoes all on top of a crunchy yet hearty crust. OH SO GOOD. They also had a mac and cheese pizza that looked like it was a crowd pleaser. . I would totally come back if I'm back in NC! Just a chill place to hang out with friends, drink some beer, eat some hearty food in a laid back but hip atmosphere.","We discovered this place 5 years ago and I cannot go to Vegas and not stop by this place. Best pizza hits the spot after a night out. left overs still hit the spot a day later. . must try the Gotham Pizza and Wings!!! Their Bleu Cheese is super yummy !!!","The first time we were here it was for dinner. It was very crowded and a bit slow but the pizza was delicious. . We came back two days ago for lunch. It was reasonably priced with the perfect amount of food for lunch! For about $8 we each got a small salad and a 6\" pizza. I got the bada bing and he got pepperoni and mushroom. . I highly recommend the bada bing- it has bacon, fontina, white sauce, caramelized onions, grilled asparagus, and roasted mushrooms. YUM","The pizza is not only huge but also delicious and has stolen my heart as my new favorite pizza place. We also tried the garlic cheesy bread, fried zucchini, and Caesar salad. The salad was simple and what you'd expect. The zucchini is sliced small with tasty batter, although we did not receive any ranch so if you like it with ranch apparently you need to ask. This giant pizza would easily feed 10 people; perfect for kids and parties. Looking forward to trying their pastas and calzones. . !","If you want consistently good pizza and not one of the big chains (Pizza hut, dominos, etc), then try 500 degrees. This is my go-to pizza place in Charlotte for NY style pizza. Please note, ilve always eaten in, so I cannot speak to delivery. This review is for dine-in only.","Ordered a Taco pizza, we are from Iowa and grew up with this pizza. The waitress came out and said they accidentally put sour cream on it , we said that's ok we would still take it. Pizza came out cold and boneless wings were frozen and not what you would ever expect at a pizza joint. Terrible experience all the way around. Girl that worked there was more concerned about people in the back and at the bar and going to ride her horse. Terrible experience and will never be back. Joe Whitty would be ashamed of this establishment !!!!!","After noshing on sandwiches for three days in a row I really needed something else to eat. Order up a large pizza with pepperoni, bacon, onions, jalapeno, and tomato. Delivery was faster than estimated, and the it was to die for. The crust was absolutely perfect, just the right amount to crisp on the outside without being overdone, but still soft and moist on the inside. The pizza was loaded with toppings, and we made short work of it. Definitely the best pizza in Moon.","Stumbled in while waiting for a pizza NYE and I'm glad I did. The staff was friendly the customers at the bar were friendly. Good beer selection and COLD!!! I will definitely be back! Oh and can't forget I won $400 in keno! Woooohoooo what a great way to start my new year!!","Good service, good pizza, and a good location!. I do wish this place was a little closer to me since they have a $6. 95 lunch special for a personal size pizza with anything on it. Great deal!. Everyone working here was really cool!","Vapiano's is designed and laid out like a stylish European quick service restaurant. As you walk in you are handed a plastic charge card the size of a credit card. When you order the food, the price is added to the card and you pay for everything as you leave. . Since everything is self service, tipping is not required, however, leaving a couple of dollars for the person cleaning tables never hurts. . The food selection ranges from a wide variety of pasta (made fresh in house) with different meat, vegetable and sauce options to pizza, sandwiches and salads. All of the dishes are priced reasonably and the portion sizes are generous. . The overall atmosphere is casual with decor that would not be out of place in a much more upscale restaurant. . There are two reasons why Vapiano's did not receive a 5 star rating from me:. The amount of meat, seafood, etc. that comes with most of the dishes tends to be on the small to miniscule side. . The other proplem is the consistency of the food. Depending on the cook that prepares your order, your food may be over or under seasoned. . The other night we ordered the Pesto E Spinaci and the \"hint\" of basil pesto ended up being a big heaping boat load of pesto. . Overall the is a very good place to go if you are looking for good food at a fair price. As long as you don't mind getting your own food and drink refills you should be able to enjoy Vapiano's.","We sailed our boat to Port City Club and docked along side their pretty Boardwalk, in 6' of water. We chose outside seating, waiting just a few minutes. Flatbread pizzas were huge and a very fun selection of flavors. Our server Danielle was experienced, she knew the menu, made helpful recommendations and even knew that the boat fuel and pump-out services were only available on weekends. Very reasonable priced, we will definitely return, soon!","You say scadda. . . I say bush!  (I have no idea why I wrote that other than the fact it sounds funny). Anyways, been here twice and I have yet to be disappointed. The food is great and you can tell fresh. The mozzarella which is made in house is divine. It's a must try!  The pastas are fresh and filling and the 2 pizzas that I tried (the Margherita and the chicken/goat cheese) were delicious. Both times I have had to basically roll out of the restaurant. . Their blood orange cucumber mint mojitos are just simply what I imagine heaven must taste like. . They have a huge space upstairs if you want to have a private event. The atmosphere is fun and the servers are great. Definitely on my list to head back again","Great NY style pizza. Probably one of the best spots for it. Honestly, I've been here and Secret Pizza for NY style and I prefer Rocco's. Wings are great, too!","Hey, these guys deserve 5*. They have a great selection of games. They also have an electronic gaming room for video games, nice pinball section, a nice carnival style type games as well. . The place is clean, including the bathrooms. We were there for about three hours and there was someone going around cleaning up the floors the whole time. . We were on our way to the airport, so Corinne offered to keep our luggage in the bowling alley section where there is a security camera. How great is that? You don't find that kind of service at most family arcades. . We love any arcades, and have been to so many different ones in different cities, and this has to be one of the better ones all around. . On Sundays they have unlimited play for families for 995 per person, which includes a free large pizza. We got the Groupon which was $20 for all day unlimited gaming. Any other video arcade would've set us back at least triple this amount. . Thank you Corinne and staff again for your great customer service and kindness.","Great pizza. Even better wings!!  Only downfall was 75 minute delivery and pizza was lukewarm. Delivery guy was great and so nice!","Some of the best pizza in Vaughan! The thin crust dough is outstanding. It's in a location that's not visible from the street but definitely worth going to.","Not exactly NY style but pretty good pizza. Certainly way better than any of the chains that deliver. They don't use crumbled fake sausage, it's actually sliced. I would order from here again. I had it delivered to my hotel room and the delivery guy was nice and prompt.","Seeking a dine in place for slice of pizza for kiddos and I to kill 2 hours for last client of the  night: 7pm. To our surprise it's Tuesday's $1. 00 cheese pizza slice day! Ended up with street  fries, chessy passion bread and chicken parmigiana. Portions were just right for a party of 4. So tasty and yummy.","Was here for my birthday a few months back. Had their fresh mozzarella, seafood salad, and pizza to share. . They pride themselves in being a fresh and authentic Italian restaurant and I decided to visit based on good recommendations. . I thought the mozzarella was quite bland tbh. You eat it with your hands and it comes with bread and sea salt and some cranberries. Not much taste in the mozzarella and it didn't really melt like you would imagine (I pictured it to be more like hot pizza but it wasn't). . My seafood pasta was made with their in house fresh pasta. It was my first time having it and it was quite good. However for their seafood the calamari was quite skimpy and same goes for the shrimp. It came in a marinara tomato type sauce. . We shared pizza (the one with all the meat on it) and it was pretty good - you could cut up the pizza yourself with provided scissors. A little salty but expected due to the cured meats. The crust was good. Probably the safest/best thing I ate the whole night. . Probably won't be back. . Might try Levetto which is similar with better reviews.","We visited on a Sunday and the place was packed. We were seated right away. The service is 5 star top notch. Now, I am a Chicagoan and love pizza and I was excited to try this place. We ordered an appetizer, the calamari, and it was good. It was served with marana no cocktail sauce, but I like mine with a ranch dip and that was pretty tasty. The pizza, my husband and I ordered an 18 inch thin. . . and it was paper thin. It was more like a flat bread than a pizza. We had half cheese and half mushroom and green peppers. They use fresh veggies and the sausage was excellent however it was sparingly on the pizza. Very frugal with the ingredients considering the pricing. I will try it again, but maybe the deep dish.","Pizza is great cheesy goodness. Some of the best on the West side. Occasionally the pizzas aren't as good though and I'm not sure why. Sometimes they seem to be undercooked and missing the juicy factor.","I don't know why the ratings are so low but it is definitely a five stars for me. The food here is amazing-best pizza that I've every had (great crust and tasty ingredients)!!!","I love this place. Anytime I'm craving quick/casual Italian this is where I go. The staff are extremely friendly and always willing to answer any questions about the menu. The pizza is delicious. . . I've tried a few different kinds and all have been tasty (i highly recommend trying the buffalo milk mozzarella). Also, the price is so reasonable. . . . I mean I can't complain when date night costs less than $25.","Came here with my family on Sunday afternoon. There weren't many people there but we decided to brace it anyway. Glad we did. The food was reasonably priced and very good. We had burgers and pizza. They have a tremendous selection of beers on tap as well. The only negative was that there was a subtle weird smell when we walked in and it was there pretty much the whole time. Hard to describe exactly. It wasn't terrible or overwhelming but did detract from the experience in my opinion. I'd still probably come back.","Incredibly excellent dinner! We decided to visit Sapori D'Italia after our recent move to nearby Rio Verde, AZ. This small Italian eatery is in Fountain Hills, the nearest town to RV. We had heard about it from some of our new neighbors, who said it was a not-to-be-missed place. We arrived in the late mid-week afternoon. It was already fairly busy with locals, mostly sitting at the bar area, chatting and visiting over wine and drinks with friends. It was an early dinner for us. The service was quick and friendly. We decided to order the sample appetizer plate and the La Capricciosa pizza (house fresh made mozzarella, tomato sauce, smoked ham, artichoke hearts, imported mixed olives, porcini, shitake and white mushrooms). The appetizers were mostly good, except for the calamari, which was a bit tough. The pizza, however, was amazing! One of the best we've ever had. We substituted the regular smoked ham aspect of the dish with Italian sausage, and it was just sooo delicious! The flavors were subtle yet distinct. Amazing! Just as good, well, actually even better, if that was possible, was the Coconut Pie dessert. To die for! During the dinner, we had the pleasure of conversing several times with the owner and chef, Gaspar. We highly recommend trying out this neighborhood gem. We will definitely be back soon.","We stopped in to get one of their Bloody Mary's, which did not disappoint. It was kind of a different taste than I have had before, but still good. It had hint of a horseradish undertone. I didn't think it was particularly spicy, but a few people around us asked for tomato juice to tame it down. The bartender was really friendly and attentive. The pizza was a thicker style crust with a lot of diced up pepperoni on top. It was really good and definitely filling. All of the food that came past us looked wonderful. This is a great place to just grab a drink or to sit and have lunch.","Our lunch was my 3rd or 4th time here- and I still really like it after our meal today. We came here for Mother's Day lunch after a morning of hockey- meaning we were all pretty hungry. There was a brunch menu for Mothers Day, as well as the regular menu- and Sundays are HALF PRICE pizza!!!!  We started with a Proscuitto scolledina to share- tasty, esp the fig jam to compliment the meat. I had the goat cheese pizza- amazingly yummy pizza with intriguing mix of toppings, and with the Sunday special, only cost $9???? OMG, that is crazy cheap for the high quality pizza. Henry and kris each had the Cibo burger with a very large side of truffle oil/Parmesan fries- I helped Henry finish this double patty burger, and it was flavourful and juicy. The fries were totally irresistible- they were pretty hard to not reach over and steal, many times. Adam got the kids spaghetti with meatballs- and despite coming here starving, was still only able to finish half, as it was really large and filling for a kid meal. . The meal itself was super- it is a great place for pizza.  . Service was attentive and polite. . It is a pretty loud place, but I can excuse that because it is family friendly, and with today being Mother's Day- I am guessing there were more kids, toddlers and babies than normal, for lunch, at one time.","I called Parlour this morning after a particularly embarrassing hair-related melt down at about 1am last night. I asked for something anytime this week and they said they could fit me in today, giving me a choice of three different time slots. . I was actually quite worried that the place would be pretentious, because I'm very wary of people in the services industry judging me. I can't even order pizza without worrying that the man on the phone thinks I'm a tool. Call it a quirk? Anyway, I got there and everyone was lovely. I couldn't have asked for nicer people. Really warm and friendly. . Considering I made my appointment so last minute I was practically a walk-in, I didn't ask for any particular stylist. I ended up with Matthew and the two of us had a grand time. I told him I hadn't had a haircut since I left Ireland and that it needed to be done, but that I didn't really want a hair cut at all. I told him short hair makes me look like Kelly Osbourne but right now the condition was just awful, and despite three years of growing out half a decade of Kelly hair, I was ready to let go of some of the length. . LONG story short, my hair turned out fantastic -- a million times better than I had hoped. Matthew was very meticulous and his attention to detail was mental. The man did things to my bangs that I never knew was possible (and I'm a complete hair salon slut, not to mention a demon with a scissors, so I've had it all)!! He was also just a medium amount of chatty, which was nice. I get shy at the hair dressers, and when I'm nervous, I ramble. A few times he asked me questions, about where I was from, my job, whatever, and I could hear myself starting to babble, so I had to catch myself and just tell my mouth to shut up. Still, he didn't seem to mind my babbling or my bouts of silence!. At the end of the day, I expected to come home moderately happy; knowing I'd done the right thing but depressed that I'd lost half my hair. I actually like it as much as my old hair!! YAAAY! At $68, I was pretty pleased. His next appointment actually arrived before he was finished and he still took his time, cutting this strand and that until it was perfect. . If this were eBay I'd be all A+++, would do business with again! But I guess five stars will have to do. I'll definitely go back.","Just got done enjoying a huge slice of pizza (pepperoni &amp; sausage). Perfect balance of flavorful sauce and cheese. Comfortable atmosphere and pleasent waitstaff. Will definitely be back again.","Unlike the Oregano's out in Litchfield/Avondale,  bell and 67th Ave  was mediocre. I gave 2 stars because my dad and husband stated their stuffed Chicago pizza was descent. My Bistro thin crust was not. It would have been a great pizza but  OMG I thought I was just chomping on salt tablets. I barely ate half a slice. My husband about died from coughing because it was just so freaking salty. Even the Pacific Ocean doesn't have that much salt (duh this is exaggerated for those of you who get so f*cking technical) but that's what it felt like to me. I had no appetite after that so I had them take it away and just sat there. Won't be going back. . Id rather go to #1 brothers.","The pizza is great! I had the Sofia and if I could, I'd get it at least once a week. Unfortunately, the restaurant isn't a block or two from my apartment and they don't deliver. There are at least a dozen other pizza restaurants that are much closer to me and which are open later (like after a show downtown). . I hope Pizzuvio does well--the food is good quality and truly authentic. I just wish they would make themselves more accessible to downtown residents and downtown arts denizens.","Have been trying to find different places and read the reviews and gave it a try. . . . we are glad that we did!. Great food at a good price, feed 3 for less than $40. . Supreme pizza had so much flavor and the crust was so good. Chicken wings are good size. . We will be back for another try!","This has the best pizza place and other wonderful takeout. The service is absolutely awesome every time we go. John is the nicest man, very professional, and always so friendly. My husband and I will only go here for pizza, salads. And other take out. . The owner is amazing and all of the employees. . I truly enjoy 8550 w charleston pizza. . Kim and Gabe","(This review is for the Summerlicious 2014 dinner). I had pretty low expectations for this place after reading the Summerlicious menu. The entrees didn't seem spectacular and there was a pretty big discrepancy in price between lunch ($15) and dinner ($25) even though the menu was mostly identical. . Reservations were easy to make although the hostess made an error with the number of seats we wanted. My dining companion was quite shocked to hear that our reservation was mistakenly made for 18 instead of the agreed-upon 2. . Fast forward to dinner: . The location is great and if you live in Toronto, you've most likely walked bast the restaurant multiple times. The inside is narrow but had comfortable seating. I loved the rustic decor and the novelty moose behind our seats. Free wifi is definitely welcome since you can always escape to your phone if your dinner partner turns out to be a dud. . I ordered the smoked salmon and beet salad which was delicious and my favourite part of the three course meal. My entree was a korean pizza (simple but great) which I could only eat half of, although I was absolutely ravenous. Dessert was an apple fritter with dulce de leche, a perfect and not too heavy way to end the meal. I tasted my friend's bread pudding dessert which wasn't nearly as good as the apple fritter. . I can't wait to come back and devour the duck poutine pizza.","\"In crust we trust\"--The Constitution of Pizza. This historical declaration of pizza is a timeless American value. In other words, the pizza was great! Ordered a lot: garden salad with Nello's house dressing (unique and delicious sauce), the pizza Bianca (a sauceless wonder), the Hawaiian (Maui, is that you?!), and a classic pepperoni! One member of our dinner party found the pepperoni somewhat salty. However, the pizza dough was simultaneously soft and crunchy at the crust and the sauce is a rich tomatoey goodness! I'd come back; only draw back was the wait","A pretty good  pizza but was told that it should be delivered in about 45 minutes instead of the 2 hours that it took.","This rating is specifically for this location. The chain itself is acceptable, as others have stated you come here for convenience and cheaper prices. . I come to this location occasionally because it's close to work. EVERYTIME I come, they don't have veggie, which is the only thing I want. They actually don't have a lot of ready made options available. I think it's because the store owner is facing demand and doesn't want a lot of leftovers. I get that, but I come at lunch and they will be opened for the rest of the day, into the evening. Veggie is also a pretty popular choice, so I think that's unacceptable. . Like one reviewer mentioned here previously, they are reluctant to make more pizzas. As I'm sitting in the store eating and writing this review, I see 5-6 more customers request for veggie. Only then did they agree to make a veggie pizza. It's ridiculous though because now everyone needs to wait 15 mins for their pizza, when the expectation was grab and go. People may be getting a freshly made pizza, but it's business hours and everyone is busy trying to get back to work.","Food was good when it finally arrived. . . Service was barely ok. Bartender/waitress brought every item for four people ONE  ITEM AT A TIME OVER AN HOUR. It was ridiculous. It was not busy at all and she was not worried about it. An antipasto salad, a fish sandwich, buffalo chicken rolls and a pepperoni pizza. Not real difficult. She said she had no control as she stood at the bar on her phone and talked to two or three regulars. Worst service ever since I've been there. I love the place. Very sad.","We have been here a couple times and have always enjoyed ourselves. Friendly service and laid back atmosphere. The Bruschetta is so delicious. We also tried the Meatball appetizer with the Arugula and cheese, comes with 3 good sized meatballs and they were very tasty. I wish there was just a little bit more sauce but still very good. . The Kids got a cheese pizza and my daughter ate the whole thing! . Nice little place close to home.","Victoria made a bangin pizza! We ordered online and picked up, everything was correct. Everything was also made in no time! All employees were great. Thanks again Victoria!!","After a night of drinking downtown, I knew that I had to try the new pizza joint that everyone was talking about. So we waded through the madness of the Fremont  St. Experience and finally found them in a corner of the Plaza. When you walk up, it looks like a normal pizza place, with pies sitting out waiting to be consumed by the slice. I was immediately drawn to the white pizza and after reading the menu I knew this was not the run of the mill food court pizza. They are quite inventive with the toppings and very friendly. . I went with the White Chapel, cute name, which was a white slice featuring spinach, garlic, and ricotta. It was pretty fantastic and I definitely would have eaten another slice. It was flavorful, especially the spinach and ricotta, and the crust was crispy, thin, and delicious. My husband had a slice that had bacon, sausage, and pepperoni, a real man pizza. It was also very flavorful and delicious, you were really able to discern the flavor of each meat in every bite. I kept stealing bites each time he turned his head. We also tried a slice of the Goodman, which features spinach, potatoes, caramelized onions, and mushrooms. This was good, but not as outstanding as the other slices. We also had some garlic knots, which were good, but nothing too special. . Overall, this place is dishing up some great NY style pizza with inventive toppings. The sauce, the toppings, and the crust are all highlights to these pretty outstanding pies. This is drunk food, with some serious flavor!","So I just moved into the area and have passed by this place almost daily so finally I decided to give it a try and I can say that  I have found my new spot for pizza and wings!!! The pizza was fresh and the crust was crispy (even though I took a little longer to pick it up) the wings were amazing, I wasn't very happy about having to pay 75 cents for ranch but after seeing how big the cups of ranch were and how great it tastes I, d gladly pay $1 per cup. Also I ordered 4 (really only needed 2) and they threw in 2 more for free! Customer service was amazing, I was greeted with a big smile and greeting as soon as I walked in the door. If you're looking for pizza and wings for 2 people your best bet would be the XL one topping pizza and a half bucket of wings, chances are you won't be able to finish it and you'll have leftovers for the next day (win/win). I can honestly say that no matter where I end up in Vegas I will make the trip to Fat Moe's Pizza &amp; Wings!","Absolutely delicious food; pizza, wings (best wings anywhere, anyday, and you can't beat $7 for a dozen!) Sandwhiches, salads, and basically anything else the gastronomic wizzes cook up. Everything I have tried is awesome, and the prices are very reasonable. . The owners are a great bunch of people, and one of the cooks is from NY so he knows how to make a real pie. My fiance and I have been avid patrons for years and will continue to do so!","Very good food. I had a pizza that was very good. My wife had the seafood paste. She liked it but it was very spicy. She is not a spice fan. They did tell her that but she missed it. She said it was very good but spicy hot. Without asking and we told then they shouldn't have they took it off the bill. We made it up in a big tip. Bread pudding for dessert is out if this world. Enough for two.","Novanta is pretty delicious. I actually heard from Buzzfeed that this is the best pizza place in all of WI according to yelp reviews. I would say I expected it to be a little fancier just because the pictures made it seem that way, but that shouldn't turn you away. It's in a nice area of Middleton and the staff are very helpful and friendly. My boyfriend and I ordered two pies and they were beyond delicious. Very authentic flavors and ingredients. They keep it simple as a pizza should be. I would say you could split a pizza between 2 people but they have so many flavors why not get two and save it for a late night bite! I will definitely be coming back here for my authentic Italian slice!","My boyfriend and I ate here last night for the second time. The first time I had the chicken tender basket and it was alright. It wasn't great; the seasoning was a little strange, but the chicken was very crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. . Pizza: Last night we had the pizza and it was delicious. My bf had the veggie pizza and he thought it was alright, nothing special though. I, however, had the pepperoni, mushroom and onion. It was very good. It had the right amount of greasiness, the cheese and the toppings were both very good and the thin crust was delicious and crispy. The crust was almost burnt but that's how I like it so I had no complaints. It was much better than the average pizza from the various, big delivery chains. . The Price: the price was a little outrageous. For two slices, our bill came to about $9, which just seems a little crazy for pizza. It was great but I don't think it was THAT great. The slices are huge so that helped justify the price A LITTLE bit. . Overall, this place is really good. The pizza I had was a good size and tasted good. It was cooked perfectly too, when you'd bite into it, all of the cheese and toppings wouldn't come off in one huge, messy piece. I would definitely come back here and I would recommend this place if you have a craving for pizza and you're in or near the Plaza. . Update: today we had the buffalo wings and they were delicious. Especially for a place that doesn't specialize in wings. I could literally eat a vase full of them. Sooo good.","Faema makes incredible coffee. A fun very Italian caffe. Go for good pizza and panini. I like but don't love the salads but sometimes I grab one anyhow. Free wifi and great staff.","Restaurant is very cute, located in downtown Champaign with seating outside. Our server was Ariel (who was wonderful) and we were celebrating my daughter's bday who is a student at U of I. We had the cheese curds which are awesome and really crispy and warm and yummy. We had those with the champaign blanc beer (yum) and for dinner we had the chicken pizza, bison burgers and the egg burger - everything was really delicious. Cooked to your liking. For dessert we had the cherry bread pudding which was amazing, never had that before and the strawberry/mascarpone crapes (those were just OK).  They weren't warm as you expect crepes to be and the crape itself was almost too hard and crispy rather than soft and warm so next time I will skip those and go straight for the cherry pudding. Overall, I have never really found a place that I would go to again while vising U of I but I would definately return to Destihl especially for the cheese curds and beer, which if you are a beer lover they have a very nice selection. Thanks again Ariel for your excellent customer service and for being so attentive to our table!!","My husband and I have been to Stevie's a few times and have enjoyed it each time. We love having a pizza shop local where you can sit and relax and have a glass of wine or beer with dinner. The owners, Bessa and daughter Violetta, are very friendly. We even had them join us to eat at one of our visits. The pizza is delicious and we have also had eggplant parm, meatball and chicken parm sandwiches. All were cooked to perfection. My husband even catered my surprise birthday party from them and all the food, eggplant, chicken and baked ziti were outstanding. It is great to have fellow native New Yorkers in the area making delicious food,  At times we wish they would deliver but then we wouldn't get to see their smiling faces and terrific customer service. Welcome to Vistancia!  Definitely worth the trip!","I have typically liked the food from here when I've gotten pasta or pizza and the coconut shrimp and awesome. However, the last time we went here I ordered a steak and it was seriously under seasoned. It tasted like they did put any salt on it at all. For the price the food should always be on point in my opinion!","Gus' was created by a person I assume was like, \"hey man, college kids get drunk, can't drive, and want pizza delivered at all hours of the night. \". Thus, there is this crap hole pizza place that is run by the mentally challenged. At my high school it was the special ed kids that always served our lunches in the cafeteria, then all those kids moved to Tempe and got a job here. The biggest problem with this place is that the staff is totally careless and incompetent and I imagine on some or all drugs during work. . Actually, that's a lie, the biggest problem is the pizza is gross. It tastes like when you make a frozen Tombstone pizza at night, take it out, then you don't want it anymore so you leave it on the counter instead of wrapping it up cause you want to get back to watching Hoarders on A&amp;E.  . Then you wake up the next morning and you're like, \"oh, cool, left over frozen Tombstone pizza that's been sitting out all night. \"  So you put it in the microwave to nuke all the bacteria and get it out of the temperature danger zone. . Then you eat it and you're like, \"wow this tastes JUST like Gus' Pizza only slightly better. \"","Great little place on Kingston! I think it's been re-branded as Kingston Gourmet in the last couple of weeks. We just moved into the neighbourhood and my boyfriend and I decided to check it out to see what is was about as we saw the makeover happening. . Happy surprise! Reasonably priced and delicious. A bit of an odd menu with Indian, Italian, and burger-fare, but delicious. . We had veggie samosas while we waited and took a margarita pizza to go. Both had a bit of a spice kick to them (I have zero spice tolerance) for me, but just right for my boyfriend (who loves spicy). I highly recommend checking them out. The owner is very sweet and nice as well. We plan on showing more support to this little local place.","I love Fired Pie the pizzas have thin and crispy crust . It's a great place because it's easy to grab and go . You can make your own pizza , and there are variety of toppings to choose from. I recommend Fired Pie to everyone. . . I love Fired pie, the service is great .","The pizza was good, but not exceptional. The crust was fair, the sauce was excellent. The price was $18 for a large pizza. Considering the quality price and everything else, I rate it four stars. . I would go one more time. . Sauce was very good.","Great pizza and salad. If you like thin crust pizza and fast service this is the place to go. Build your own with about every ingredient you could possibly want.","Saw this place from the freeway and stopped in after work because I wasn't ready to fight traffic during the afternoon rush hour. Great little place with a nice comfortable bar/lounge area, a friendly bartender, and some fantastic happy-hour deals. $3 wines? At least I'll know where to send the search party if my wife ever disappears. The generic \"red\" wasn't bad, either, although I'm relatively sure it comes in boxes, not bottles.  . The caesar salad was huge, as were the spinach dip and meatball appetizers. There was some sort of pizza special, but the wife and I were already way too full to eat anything else. I guess we'll have to go back. Definitely during happy hour.","Delicious pizza, delivered . faster than expected. Much better than your generic dominoes/pizza hut. Recorded for a delightful dinner/late night snack .","The pizza is the best pizza I've had in a long time. I wanna drive back out there and have more.  . Every time someone mentions pizza I crave godfathers. The wait times are about 25 minutes. They were really busy but it was worth the wait for us!!. I wish they had more in town because this location is far from our house outside of Vegas.","really bad. ordered pizza and wings - were surprised at how quickly it arrived on a Friday evening, but the food was just not good. everything was clearly packaged, pre-made food. the wings seemed to be frozen and then fried and the sauce had little flavor.  pizza had little flavor and toppings were clearly not fresh - the sausage was uniform, frozen, flavorless balls of \"meat\". we're always happy to support a local business, but this just didn't do it for us. . 2 stars for delivery speed.","Was me and my family's first time eating here, best choice I made for dinner. I ordered two pizzas, one with pepperoni and the other with sausage. They both were delicious, their cheese was nice and stretchy. The mild sauce and BBQ wings were really good with the ranch sauce. Their fries were really bland but dipping it in ranch made up for it. The wait time was not bad and their service was helpful to us. Not bad for venturing away from the popular chains. Would totally recommend if you live in the area.","Even though you will more than likely have to stand in a decent line to order, it's always worth the wait! The food is great, the outdoor grassy area with large picnic tables are so charming, and it is so pet and kid friendly! . Love the burgers and pizza! Have heard awesome things about the bbq too! So much fun for my nieces to run around after eating. There will more than likely be an abundance of kids playing together as it's almost like picnicking at a park when you come here for lunch. . Overall such a unique, delicious and charming place, bravo!","I've been coming here for many years. the salads and soups are so delicious. the garlic bread sticks are to die for.  the ambiance is great. a great place for pizza too. the bar area is fun with tv's but this is definitely a family place too and good for big parties.  you can also sit outside.  highly recommend - you can't find food like this everywhere.  the owner is originally from New York so he knows his pizza!","This place never disappoints the employees are always so kind and helpful and I absolutely love all of their pizzas and their weekly specials are usually a really interesting combination that I would never think to put together and yet it always turns out phenomenal. I use to live less than 5 min away from this place and now I'm about 15 min away but still visit weekly it's that great!","The best pizza in Pittsburgh. My absolute baseline for pizza sampling. . I wish it were closer. . My last time in the 'burgh, I did a scientific sampling of the big three Murray ave pizza joints and my more mature palate agrees with my stoned highschool palate: Aiellos is best.","Ohmygawd. So good. . You may actually drive by this place and not notice that a restaurant is here (since it is hidden behind trees and next to dairy farms, corn fields and such). . Casual atmosphere with large out door picnic area, very pretty. . The Half Ribs with garlic fried, pulled pork and cole slaw (Mine), and the Pesto Chicken Sandwich (Hubs) was to die for !!. Ribs- Super moist, tender, fall-off-the-bone, finger-linkn', smokey, sweet &amp; bold sauciness! . Cole-Slaw- So-so. Wish it was more like KFC 'slaw (sweet). . Garlic Fries- Good, a little greasy towards the bottom, but very crispy and flavorful. . Pulled Pork- Nice and plentiful. . Total cost? About $30. But ssooo much food and exactly what I expect BBQ to be. . I cannot believe this place is only 10 minutes from our house and we haven't come by sooner. . Note: This place has pizza, milkshakes, burgers, salads, ribs, etc. All your classics done very very well.","What a lovely surprise in the heart of Chinatown!  . This place is divided into the more informal, cafe area in the front and the restaurant area in the back. The high ceilings, exposed brick walls, beautiful wood floors, open kitchen and vintage-modern decor make it, truly a gem in this neighbourhood. The staff are welcoming, attentive and very friendly. . There are so many Italian places in the city, but Strada 241 sets itself apart in both its location and unique takes on some of their menu items. . Fellow eater and I started with the asparagus (I believe they were fire roasted) and Olive Cured Salmon appetizers (resembled a colourful cole slaw). Both were absolutely delicious in presentation and taste. . I had the Bucatani pasta and fellow eater had the Zia Maria pizza. Again, simple, fresh and delicious. . For dessert I had to order the Chocolate &amp; Hazelnut Semifreddo. Oh my, I had no idea so many layers of incredible goodness could be combined like that!  From what I could see, most (or maybe all) desserts are served in mason jars, which is a great touch. This one had a new surprise as I continued to dig down through the layers to the bottom. Fellow eater just had the nutella latte, which he claims is incredible. . I am even considering returning tomorrow just to have the nutella latte and hang out a bit at the front to sample a pastry. I may bring my laptop to make it look like I am doing work.","THe \" local\" pizza shop for me. I get that pizza craving most of the time but do not like to travel to my favorite places all the time. There prices are decent and they offer delivery.","Probably one of the best places my wife and I have gotten pizza from. The atmosphere is great. I got a couple of the mixed drinks and they were fantastic, and our order consisted of the personal lunch pizzas, two meatballs and the oven baked wings. The wings were cooked perfectly and the meatballs were some of the best I have eaten anywhere, and when we got our personal pizzas, they were significantly larger than what we expected. Toppings were generous, and the pizzas were deliciously crispy with just the right amount of grease. Our server, Bryan, was very friendly and accommodating and made our experience all the better! . We would certainly recommend this place to friends, family, and strangers. This restaurant can expect our repeat business!","Yes. The best pizza on the west side. Excellent prices and excellent pizza. I will continue to go out of my way for Novanta. . These are personal pies, indistinguishable from Caf\u00e9 Porta Alba's (their Hilldale sister location is pricier) and comparable to Pizza Bruta (which is a bit drier, more floury). Some other review will say more about how they use some quick-fire 90-second oven whatever, but the result is a really balanced margherita. (Though sometimes the cheese areas are really small in a sea of red. ) I'm also always so surprised to see the staff so perky and welcoming compared to other Madison-area restaurants. And I appreciate it! They appear to have a fair amount of lunch traffic and everyone sitting is always cheery. I don't get it. They must not work at the university. This is the (personal) pie to beat on the west side, at least until Sal's moves out here.","Fresh mozzarella and pasta are the reasons to come. Consistency is hit or miss, though. My second visit the spaghetti was mushy and had to send it back. Still well worth it for fresh pasta. . Tried the pizza, didn't like it. The charity bread is super oily. Too bad no real bread options here. . Mozzarella and pasta and fantastic though.","You know, despite the name and all that, I never really expected authentic Chicago style pizza here. So, while I can understand the disappointment voiced in several reviews here, I didn't feel it myself. . I've only gotten the \"Chicago-style\" pizza here, but like I said, I wasn't expecting Lou Malnati's. I was expecting a normal pizza with a thick crust. Like the deep dish at Domino's or Pizza Hut. I don't know why, that's just how it was. And that's exactly what I got. And I'll be honest, it tastes like a more flavorful Pizza Hut pizza. I don't really know what to say besides that. It's not the best pizza, but it's not the worst. And sometimes you just get a craving for pizza like this. . Just don't go in expecting something great and you'll be fine.","I've only been when Lucille's in full holiday mode (went twice while in town for thanksgiving) but I thought they did a great job with the decor but especially the seasonal cocktail menu - really cute names from classic holiday movies and they were served in festive mugs. That being said, it feels like CHRISTMAS in there right now so maybe steer clear if that's not what you're going for. . The first time, I only had drinks downstairs in the vault (very cool) and then once the upstairs loft type area cleared out of people having dinner, we moved up to a table there since we had a big group. The next time, four of us had two steel pan pizzas and all thought it was delicious (and were so stuffed). I'd be curious to try some of the other options but it does seem like they're trying to make pizza their focus. They gave us an envelope for a holiday raffle that you have to bring back in Jan/feb to see if you won -- again, 10/10 for the holiday branding/marketing.","3. 5 STARS. LOCATION - 4 STARS - It's 17th ave! Parking? You know. AMBIANCE - 4 STARS - Very cool decor, awesome patio! Large space! SERVICE - 2. 5 STARS - Overly young and inexperienced staff - felt like we were being served by high school students - for real. FOOD - 4 STARS - Interesting menu, the food was good, the pizza was supremely delicious, the appetizers are small and equally delicious. PRICING - 3 STARS - average for this type of restaurant in this location. Don't expect any bargains. Other thoughts. The paper menus are, indeed, flimsy as noted by others. The chairs were comfortable. The noise level can be high when full. Like it or not. If you are a 6 ft plus cowboy, you might consider passing this space up for a great steak house. Dinner for 4 without alcohol or desert and with tip will run you in the $105 to $115 range. Fun place.","Good pizza, good salad, a bit pricey but they have good specials. Quick service and clean areas. Pretty solid place and in my opinion better than Mellow Mushroom across the street!","This place is so ASNFPI#&amp;$*#$Y YES!. If you want to eat at this place, make sure you go to the one in Centennial Center, it's awesome. Can't say the same for the Summerlin one. . I've been going here since high school, it's always so much fun and the environment is very family-oriented and friendly. I remember a few years back they used to have this balloon guy that came in and made all this crazy shit, but haven't seen him recently, so me and my friends probably scared him off. . The food is a reasonable price and super good, the pizza is what this place is famous for, but the pastas and everything else is also just as delicious! I take my mom here all the time. The waitresses are so funny and they're always so nice, it's nice to see her have a good time for a change. . The place never gets too crowded, so it's often pretty quiet in here and you can actually hear the conversations with each other. It's Seat-Yourself policy unless you have 5 or more people, so you can even pick where you want to sit. . This is truely one of the only places I'm a regular at, I recommend it to anyone!","Atmosphere/vibe/decor is 5/5 no question. Not much of a fancy cocktail person so I just give a generic thumbs up because they have whiskey they can put over rocks for me. The pizza sadly is no better than a 3/5. . The magic number feels like 4 stars overall. With all that the Madison food scene has to offer, go to Lucille for drinks before/after dinner elsewhere. The greater point there being you should work in a stop at Lucille though. Cool spot.","I really, really really wanted to love this restaurant! And I almost convinced myself that I did. All I wanted was a comfortable, family friendly neighbourhood restaurant with good beers on tap, red wine and yummy comfort food. Hey! looked like it was going to be THE one. The service we had was super friendly, and I was excited by the kid sized tables and cozy ambience. Excited by the menu, I was looking forward to a nice glass of wine and a homey dinner. No red wine. No worries, I like beer. I ordered the roast chicken which was indeed spectacular (all three bites of it). No kid menus but the kids had a pizza and my hubby had the pork which would have been delicious if it had been warm. All of it yummy. And tiny. Which would be ok if it wasn't so expensive. We were treated wonderfully however. Decided to try it again, for brunch. The same great Hey! service. I had the quiche (tasty yet cold and pricey), kid had waffles (about the size of a cd) which hubby ate because he was so hungry for more. I am all for smaller portions (the way we should go i think. I like the Ace for that reason--one of many) BUT NOT AT THAT PRICE. I would happily pay $18 for a main if it included a little more. I would not complain if the price dropped or if the portions were larger to justify the cost. Wonderful ambience, lovely people. I know that this place could be so much better. It has all of the right ingredients but just needs to get the balance right. I look forward to that time.","Fortunate to have Benny's here in the Southside. A VA gem that snuck over the Mason-Dixon Line. Ridiculous large 30\" pizza NY Style, cannot be beat.","The place was very clean, service was friendly and timely, I just didn't really like the pizza. If you like the pizza you would like this place. I feel bad for giving it a bad review, I really do. Sausage was way too spicy, not much of a flavor except hot and didn't have enough cheese on it. I'm sorry Pizza Pit, I wish I liked you!","This place is absolutely bull s**t how can it possibly take 2 hours to make a pizza and chicken wings and deliver it when i live at most 10 minutes away. On top of taking that long the pizza was cold chicken was cold no sauce for breadsticks whoever's in charge needs to be replaced. If i could give 0 stars i would.","My daughter and I were excited to order pizza tonight but ended with dissatisfaction originally the pizza arrived in poor condition with cheese missing at the crust edges and piled in the center it also was missing the garlic butter I had ordered we called the store and were told they were sending a replacement after an hour and 10 minutes  later we called because it had not arrived they awnsered the phone by saying pizza hut even though it was clearly papa John's we were then told the pizza had left 10 minutes ago it finally arrived after a total of an hour and 20 minutes and this was my remake it looked much better but by this time it was 5 minutes till 10 next time I order it will not be from here as my child and I are now eating at 10 o clock when my original order was put in at 7:59 very dissatisfied with the service and lack of professionalism","We got this buy a pizza, get four 1 hour game card deals. It was really weird. They want you to go sit down, order a pizza, and then go play games, at which point your pizza will be done and you can eat. We wanted to play first, eat last so we had to go to a hostess who sent us to a waitress, who take 20 minutes to order our pizza and get our game cards. Everyone was getting ancy to play. . When we did start playing, about one third of the games did not work with the type of play card we bought. we couldn't win tickets or prizes with this card. . When we did sit down for pizza, it took 45 minutes for the pizza to show up and they place wasn't even busy. The salads were brown and soggy. The pizza was typical new york style pizza. . So, yeah, not what I would call an awesome place.","was told order would be ready in 15 minutes for pick up.  got there and was told that they were out of pizza and out of wings!!! it's saturday night at 10 pm.  that's f'ed up.  no apologies and no attempt to make ammends. Not cool, Pizza Hut. Not cool.","Damn this place is top notch. Perfectly cooked artichoke that me n my girl had. We also split a funghi pizza which was delicious . good ambiance . Best of all our waiter  Cory was an excellent waiter. very professional . Super good attitude as well. Get the man a raise! cheers Cory","Finally, a local pizza place that also delivers! Great pizza, wings, chicken alfredo, and the garlic bread is really good. The staff is really nice and they have specials all the time. Would definitely recommend this place.","The place has the best pizza!  I have a regular craving for their four seasons pizza. As the name might indicate it has four different toppings and you get two slices of each. Cajun shrimp, prosciutto, olive, and mushroom and onion. The Cajun shrimp and the prosciutto is just fantastic!  Add a very tasty Greek salad which goes perfectly with the pizza. We have it almost once a week to go; but also dine in occasionally and service is always nice.  . I am giving the 5 stars for the pizza, Greek salad and eggplant. The eggplant is great, it has a meat like quality but is all eggplant.  . When in North, North Scottsdale visit your Uncle Louie,  you will be glad you did.","Got my usual stuffed chicken pesto pizza. Its a great pizza. This time it didn't have a top crust. So really wadnt a stuffed pie. Called to see if this was right,  Jordan assured me it was. Took photo.","Every time I go to the Strip and do not eat at Primanti's I feel like I'm cheating on my significant other. Still, in the name of trying new things, we tried a brunch with friends at Bella Notte a few Sundays ago. They do make a decent bloody mary, which is a good start. I ordered a couple slices of pizza with various toppings and my date ordered a calzone. My pizza came out cold and her calzone was piping hot from the oven. Like some other reviewers have noted, if you order things that take different cooking times, you can expect some things to be cold. Their kitchen can't seem to get it together enough to present all the food at a reasonable temperature. If I go back, I'll try order something that takes a long time to cook like a calzone. Or I'll just go to Primanti's.","Didn't even get a chance to order. Incredibly rude over the phone, unfriendly and not helpful at all. Pretty sure I was going to get spit pizza anyway. 0 stars if I could. . . . .","We are from Chicago, so yes we know Chicago pizza and enjoy it very much. The first time we came to this location we pre-ordered so our Chicago style pizza would be ready. When we got there we waited a short while and out came a steaming hot pizza just the way we like it. The crust was crispy as it should be. The waitress was nice. Today we once again pre-ordered our deep dish Chicago style pizza and we waited a short time but this time it was luke warm, not hot nor was the crust crispy. We did not complain to the waitress because it's not her responsibility to cook the pizza. We did still enjoy it and we always order a large so we can have left-overs to take home. This young lady was same waitress we had previously and she was friendly but I think she may have been a bit preoccupied. One improvement might be the toppings should be a little more plentiful, second if you're a \"sports\" bar, have baseball on too if it's baseball season, third since we had a Groupon the check did not reflect the proper amount of tip and would hate her to be cheated out of the correct amount. My daughters are in the service industry and I know the importance of tipping. I always try to tip 20% unless service is bad.","A coworker of mine said I had to try MOD pizza after she found out I had never been, so we went for lunch today. I am very glad she motivated me to give this place a try. The 11'' pizza was the perfect size, tasted amazing, and the service was beyond what I am accustomed to from a quick place to grab lunch. I will definitely be returning. Shout out to the GM (Mike, I think), who made sure our experience was 5 star worthy.","Yum! If you need a quick pizza come here, or better yet have them deliver. I love the thin crust pizza, will never get papa john's again when we order in. The pizza is always hot, flavorful, and fresh. Plus you can't beat the price and they mail out coupons too!","We ordered pizzas from them for the first time yesterday. They were delicious! We'll be ordering again this weekend. So far, they're the best pizza shop we have found in the Whitney area.","Vacation pricing at it's best. . $34 for pizza takeout is steep, but we are on vacation! Gotta take that regular price and x2. . Got a half forager and half margarita and it was good. The crust was a little tough for me but it was topped with some really great ingredients so I'm not against it. Overall it was a solid pizza, still not happy about paying so much for it. We are staying in the Aria so it was really convenient. It sure is a lot cheaper than the buffet called \"the buffet. \" Definitely wouldn't come if not staying in the Aria.","Amazing new bakery in Concord. . Fresh bread and new ideas. . All non gmo flour and all starter breads. . Good coffee served here and so are the meals. . Can't wait for the pizza coming soon.","Skimpy on toppings. You can design your own pizza and customize it but it is a waste of time. Ordered extra cheese, extra sauce and 2x the sausage but wasn't there. Crust was undercooked.  don't waste your money, order Pizza Hut.","We have ordered from Sophies on a few occasions, typically because it is close and because the men in our family like the heavy-meaty-greasiness of their typical pizza. The women, though, protest and we order from Sophies less and less. . They used to accomodate my request to put the toppings (of my vegetarian pizza) on top of the cheese (instead of on the bottom, which for some bizarre reason so may pizza joints like to do). Last time, the man taking the order wouldn't do it. . . \"Too much time\". I am not sure what that means, but as far as I can tell there should be no great difference and the rudeness was uncalled for. If it was my business I would want to keep a customer. Toppings on the bottom (or bottomings) are ok with meat, but most vegetable toppings like spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, etc. leach out liquid when they cook, leaving a soggy mess of the crust, while they cook beautifully on top. Needless to say, if you are a veggie lover, the crust gets slimy and the cheese just slips off the top. Just gross. . So, if you are a fan of the deep dish, more-about-the-crust, rock-in-you-gut style pizza, go ahead. If you prefer a thinner, crispy crust with exceptional toppings proudly displayed on top. . . bypass this place.","Really great food! Yeah it says seafood buffet, and there is a lot of seafood, but there's a lot of other stuff too. Sushi, pizza, steak, a lot of Chinese and Japanese noodle dishes. Sauteed mushrooms, chicken, pork. There's a great, and so fresh salad bar. Everything is hot and tastes so good. Piles of crab legs. There's also a habachi grill in the buffet line, with a cook who prepares to order. I even got to try frog legs for the first time! There's so much good food there!. The seafood stuffed mushrooms were the absolute best! . The service was great too. The wait staff kept our table clear of plates, and messes, and our glasses were refilled before they were empty. I'll definitely be back here, it was absolutely delicious, with excellent service.","When the patio opens I change it to 5! The Crust is Amazing! Pizza choices for days! Gonna try them all! Had Hot Pepperoni, Broccolini, Jalapeno. Desi was Great! The bruschetta looks amazing but only had room for pizza. The Nutella Calzone looks pretty tasty as well. Will Be back for sure. (Patio is open!)","Just scheduled a retirement party for a employee in our department that was retiring a section of the patio was reserved for us I had placed an order for pizza and wings  that were prepared and placed out in the patio just before people arrived for the party the service was great Gale one of the hostesses made us feel very comfortable and provided us with great service and everyone said the pizza and wings were awesome people who had never been at Zeppe s we're quite impressed and thanks again to Mike  the manager at Zeppe s who setup and took our reservations for the party Great job!!!!","Yaay someone who knows how to make an eggplant sub! Thank you!. Friendly service, we were late for the lunch special but the guy gave us the deal anyway, which we appreciated. . The pizza looked amazing but we were full. So I'll have to do an update when we get the chance to check that out. . Very affordable yummy food. No complaints here. :)","Truly authentic Neapolitan pizza! We had a great meal in this little Italian restaurant. . Ambiance:. The restaurant is small and family style. There are couple of tables where they put together for a large party. Atmosphere was very casual for get-together and chat over dinner. . Service:. Service was attentive. Our wait staff was very detailed when we asked her about the menu. They were keen on serving authentic Italian food so you can't find chicken in their pasta. They also recommended the sister restaurant, Rione IX, which serves Roman style pizza at the end of our meal and showed us the menu. . Food:. Don't go elsewhere if you are looking for authentic Neapolitan pizza! . They started us with good foccacia bread with a nice olive spread that I really like. . We ordered calamari, burrata, and tortino as our appetizers. Calamari was huge, good for 6 people, crispy and nicely battered. The tortino was nicely flavoured with tomato sauce and the fior di latte was very fresh. Burrata was not too bad, the pesto and tomatoes added a nice flavour to it. I like burrata cheese that is a bit more runnier. . For mains, my pappardelle with tiger shrimps and porcini mushrooms was cooked just right!!! Perfectly al dante. The sauce was sweet but a bit too rich. Too bad the tiger shrimps were still a bit mushy and wasn't as crisp as I like. . The baked gnoochi was served super hot from the oven. Say yes to cheese! . I sampled a small slice of nduja pizza and it was perfecto! Nice thin crust, perfect chewiness and crispness, and slightly charred from the wood-fired oven. The sauce was fragrantful and the fior di latte was very fresh. Nduja sausage was spicy and salty. . It was a great meal! In terms of Neapolitan pizza, this place is right up there with Pizzeria Libretto and Ovest,  and even better than Queen Mergherita Pizza! Next on the agenda is to visit the sister restaurant for Roman pizza!","Sauce has great pizza and has traditionally had great salad and pasta as well. On this visit the pizza and salad were both great, but the mac and cheese was lacking. It was more like buttered noodles than mac and cheese. . . With that said, everything else about my visit there was fantastic. . Sauce does thin, nearly personal sized pizzas that have the perfect combination of crispy crust and melted cheese. As long as you stick to the pizza here, you won't go wrong.","I was extremely disappointed as I saw a mouse run by while eating my pizza and upon pointing this out the restaurant didn't do anything about it like pay for the bill ! . Given I went out for dinner only to see a mouse was disappointing. . Lastly I'd like to add this was the second time I saw it last time was ~ 4 months ago so clearly nothing was done about that issue.","I was volunteering at Cleveland Public Theatre, decided to head over to XYZ during my dinner break. I sat at the bar, was given the menus and a water pretty quickly. I ordered a beer and a slice of cheese pizza. The pizza slice was HUGE, luckily I was hungry! I thought the service was fine. If I was in the area, I would eat at XYZ again.","My first time coming in and it's a nice atmosphere, friendly staff, great food with great prices. Arturo gave us great service, I recommend coming here for some good pizza and wings!","Walking up I was greeted by an enthusiastic pizza man. He helped me pick out a pizza to take a slice from and I grabbed a $. 50 garlic knot as well with a small drink (mostly a cup of ice). The pizza really was delicious. And the garlic knot was too. Definitely hit the spot when my 12am craving had kicked in for food. Like most things in Las Vegas it was a bit over priced for a slice of pizza that had maybe been sitting around on the counter for awhile and a drink that was mostly ice. About $8 in all. Being off the strip I'd hoped it would be more reasonable but it is at the end of the Fremont Experience in the Plaza Hotel so I didn't exactly expect it to be mom and pop pizzeria priced. I'd suggest this place to friends for sure.","Yumm, had a salami 10\" pizza and a coke for 5 bucks wow! And it was great!  Just like the east coast stuff! Tried the pepperoni was great as well. This was my second try here, got the boars head turkey sandwich first time was great!","Are you a hungry student with only a toonie in your pocket? Here is your place then!!. Pizza slices are 1. 50 for cheese and 2 for anything else, and it is damn good!. They also have falafel, and shishtaouk wraps. . For 6. 50 you can a large pizza. . Service is quick and easy.","Like a lemming, I always turn to Yelp for local dining and shopping options. I went to Pizza Hut for the lunch buffet and for $5. 99, this place rocked. I was having a big time craving for pan pizza and rather than order a whole pie (which always goes to waste), I thought I'd check out the buffet.  . There were at least six different pizzas (pan and thin crusts) with a variety of toppings (and of course, plain). There was even this DELICIOUS 'apple tart' pizza that was sooooo tasty. The pasta was not good but then that's not why you'd come here. There's also a salad bar and soup for you non-purists. The wait staff was attentive. I would definitely come here again.","Good food, pizza and Pierogies are amazing. Great prices. Dale, Thomas, kasey are great. Karaoke on Friday nights. Occasionally is cash only.","Love at First Bite, in addition to having one of the best Pizza Place names, is located in a great spot. It's across the street from Ryerson, and on the first floor of Neil Wycik. They have a sit down restaurant section which is an increasingly rare thing among pizza places. They also have a take out counter which is probably how they do most of their business, what with university students grabbing a slice and running to class. . Their slice on demand pizza has never been something I've yearned for. It's good, but not amazing. Part of this is because it never really feels fresh that way. Maybe if you go at the right time and grab one of the freshly made slices, it'd be a different experience, but I've never had such luck. . That said, I see lots of potential here, and have no trouble imagining a great pizza from them. Unfortunately, I've never ordered a whole pizza from here, but that's something that I think would be a real treat. That way, you get the freshest possible pizza. But until I actually do that, only 3 stars.","Custom Built is just up the road from my office and is one of my favorite lunch spots. It's hard not to love good pizza and these guys have some of the best in Las Vegas. Great crust and I love the concept of picking out my toppings and sauce. I take friends here for lunch or dinner all the time and everyone thinks it's a great idea. The owners should franchise this model and open them all over the country!","I have to say the pizza was surprisingly stellar but the cashier who took the order, couldnt even say hello or thank you. The guy who handed me my order was super nice, made up for the bad service to begin with.","First noticed Vapianos in Europe and it was Love at first bite. I enjoy thin crust pizza without a lot of sauce and this place definitely satisfied my need. I was pleasantly surprised to see one in Charlotte. The Pasta is delicious and if you like to have people serve or wait on you,  skip this place but if you're looking for tasty pasta at a nice price with a good atmosphere definitely try it. Don't be intimidated by the self service system. It's not rocket science. Take your card they give you when you come in to the station you prefer;  Pizza or Pasta and order. They have a small menu or you can create your own. You scan your card as you place your order and take a buzzer which will go off when your food is done. You pay on the way out by scanning the card again. Done and full!","My veggie riverboat (hoagie) was soggy and fell apart. They should use denser and fresher bread for their sandwiches. . If you want healthy food, this is not the place. The menu was almost all meat sandwiches, pizza, and deep-fried appetizers.","We accidentally ended up at Anthony's lastnight. We didn't yelp first which we normally do. . We weer not disappointed by the food which was phenomenal. But we were a bit surprised with the top of the strip prices at am off the strip location. . We both had prime rib which couldn't have been Amy better. It melted like butter in your mouth. The yuckon mashed potatoes wete delish. The creamed corn just may be the best. I was surprised they use a mild watery creamed horseradish, I prefer fresh ground horseradish with a bite. . The service was perfect or glasses were never less than half full. The waiter seated me and placed my napkin on my lap. The bus boy used a scraper to clean the crumbs for the table cloth. Oh and for a nearby diner with a child they went to another establishment in the casino to get the child a pizza which he would eat. . I highly recommend this place but be prepared for a large check at the end.","Crap! No really the worst pizza ever will never order it again. Threw it out after one bite!!!","Finally, a good place for Italian in this city. The Firm has the BEST anti pasta salad I have ever had. Never in my wildest dreams did I think about creating a salad like this. Not much lettuce (not needed) roasted red peppers and rolls and rolls of yummy meat and cheese. Not to mention, loaded with other goodies. The dressing was fantastic. Do yourself a favor and get this salad. . I am not a brushetta fan but this is phenomenal.  it's like a little pizza with cheese and balsamic vinaigrette. It's not your traditional brushetta.  . Wife had the chicken parm and I had the salmon picatta. I was so impressed. The portions were huge and the pasta complimented each dish.  . Overall, you can taste the freshness. Let me repeat that, YOU CAN TASTE THE FRESHNESS.  From the fresh pasta to the fresh tomatoes, it makes a difference. It seems like everyone working there was family. I talked to the owner and let him know what I think. He was really interested in what I had to say and even asked me questions about my cooking I do at home. . This will be the place I bring out of town visitors. The prices are more than reasonable and open for lunch and dinner.","Come for the Bloody Mary stay for the pizza. . When stomping around the Strip on a Sunday afternoon it's great to turn it into a Sunday Funday with a Bloody and slice here. The Bloody Mary has just the right amount of spice and it always hits the spot. Pizza has a nice crust that's never over cooked. It does get pretty busy but service is always fast.","More like 3. 5 . I found out about this place and had come here with the intent on ordering from the Summerlicious menu. Advertised as a \"Canadian comfort food\" place and being a Canadian, I thought I'd give it a try. . In the end though, while sitting in the restaurant, I gave up on the Summerlicious menu and gave in to my cravings. Yeah. . . . I ordered the infamous Duck Poutine Pizza. Accompanying that is the Get Your Greens Salad. What? One appetizer and one entree for two people? Why, yes. That pizza cannot be tackled on your own. The crust had an extremely flat crispy texture, which was great. I wish the duck had a bit more distinction in flavour since it just seemed to kind of blend in with the fries and wash away into the gravy. Salad was a healthy blend of spinach and kale and the dressing was pretty good. . Now, onto the exciting part. Dessert. Now, this was personally my absolute favourite thing of the meal. My boyfriend and I got the O&amp;B Artisan Butter Tart to share. Absolutely delicious. The tart was warm and flaky. Scoop some of the provided berry jam and whipped cream into the center and you've got a heavenly experience. We wanted to lick the plate when we were done. One of us may have actually done so. . Drinks-wise, I just settled for a Peach Juice. It had a large slice of lemon right inside of it and may have had a bit of lemonade inside of it. As refreshing as it was, $5 doesn't really justify it (it's in a pretty small glass). . Overall, Bannock's a-ok! The service here is friendly and it's cool that you can see the food getting prepared in the open-concept kitchen. The decor is lovely, with a mix of casual and elegant. Some items have the perfect portion size for sharing, keeping your tab on the affordable side. The items aren't too memorable but they weren't bad.","I love Naked City Pizza. This is my second trip to the Tavern. The Tavern is nice because there's more room. Only problem, it's VERY LOUD.  You can't have a conversation. . We got the guinea pizza. This time, my friend said, \"make sure it's well done. \"  Excellent!!  The pizza came out baked perfectly with a golden crust and a crunchy bottom. . I look forward to returning to try some of their dinner dishes.","I do enjoy their freshly made pizza and the service I've experienced has been really nice. The quality and taste does remind me a little of CPK, but they are both yummy to me! I love that I can see the toppings before decided which ones I would like on my creation. I'm super indecisive so luckily they weren't too busy when I was trying to decide on toppings. I'm definitely no pizza expert, but I did think it was satisfying. My husband decided he likes Pizza Hut better (his opinion doesn't count. ) They were super quick for a freshly made pizza and they also like to show off their handy work before you walk out the door.","A bit hard to find since its tucked behind chase. But the food was phenomenal!!! We had the quesadilla pizza and enjoyed every bite!","I'm not going to knock the business of what PF does. They are great, I won't lie about that. The staff there are very friendly, and very professional. I just wanna point out some things though;. . 1. Very reasonable price. $10 a month membership? Can't go wrong with that. $20 dollars a month will get you the Black card (which is what I have. ) I do go to LA every now and then (PF in Inglewood CA, which i will also review soon) and do not want to skip gym time, that's why I have it. . 2. Well, if you are trying to gain muscle and up your strength like me, then you will notice by now that PF is and is not really the place to go. If you can't afford a gym such as 24 hr fitness and cross-fit gyms, then PF or Gold's gym would be the best recommendation. . . But they really can use more free weights. . . I think PF kinda caters more to those that focus on cardio which is fine if you are trying to lose some weight. . 3. There are no classes such as (yoga, zumba, weight training, etc) however, there is a man that is a fitness trainer. But don't get too hyped about it. . . Really he is there to teach you how to properly use the equipment. There are tanning booths too for all you lovely tanners. Lol I don't use them since I'm naturally a tan color. But there is this AMAZING hydro massage bed that I love using so much after a hard workout! You use it for about 7 mins. And can control the pressure and how far up and down the back of your body you want it to go. . 5. Bathrooms stay clean, which is good. Lockers? Could be better. . . I have to admit. . . Inglewood CA Planet fitness has better lockers and so should this one here. . . Being able to see what the person owns in the locker is no good, (unless everything you own is black. ) A few are broken. . . So you have to be careful which locker you choose. Showers are okay, I never use them really since I'm a bit shy. Lol. 6. I kinda disagree with one thing though, not trying to be screwed up or anything. . . . But I seriously believe that PF should really get rid of the pizza, and cupcake giveaways. . . . There's no point in giving something like that to anyone trying to become fit or trying to lose weight. . . Its temptation to some, easy to avoid by most people. And the toostie rolls? Come on. . . . . That's candy. Even though it doesn't hurt to eat one, still. . . The point is to encourage people to come here and reach whatever goal they want to reach. But then again, I don't know if it could also be a good thing for others to learn self control. Lol. Other than all of that! Great place, cool and clean environment, nice people you meet that are very caring and considerate, and friendly staff. I will miss this place cause in a couple months I will be leaving PF for Gold's Gym. Gotta upgrade. Nothing personal! Lol","This place is awesome! The pizza was fantastic and could feed an army and the calamari was perfectly crispy and flavorful. The service was so-so in the dining room but the bartender was really super cool. We stuck around the bar for a couple hours to watch the game and talk with her and the many regulars that hang out around the bar area. The manager was one of the most on the ball and helpful managers I have ever witnessed within an establishment. . I would highly recommend this place for anyone in the area as it is in East mesa.","Small place conveniently located in Centennial in the Walmart center next to Port of Subs. Good pricing for lunch specials, that was actually the reason we stopped by. But we ended up not get getting it. My bf wanted to do the 2 slices of pizza for the lunch special but with the toppings he wanted, it was cheaper to just get a small pizza. (pictures posted). And I ended up with a patty melt. Food was decent. Nothing special. Spent more than we expected to. . . bummer. Server was nice though.","First time and definitely won't be the last!  Their veggie pizza is amazing! The owner Sumer ( I think she's an owner or manger ) was very sweet to my boyfriend and me. Always smiling and interacting with her customers. If you haven't been here yet go! You will not regret it! Only thing if you get lemonade get the strawberry lemonade the regular one is tart unless you like that ( I do, my boyfriend doesn't ) Also their milkshakes are okay. But defiantly come!(:","We decided to grab a quick pizza here before a Santana concert. Because we are familiar with the Wolfgang Puck restaurants, we knew that the these pizza would not just sit on your stomach the way most pizzas do. The food was excellent as expected, the service was very good, and the price was reasonable for what you get. If you are at Mandaly Bay or just going for a show or concert at the House of Blues. this is a great place for a quick meal before or after the show.","The best bar in Madison. Great drinks. Dope music. Awesome bartenders. Grampa's delicious pizza.","I've grabbed pies from this Fired Pie on four occasions so far, my latest trip was last night. Tons of topping selections including sauce/cheese/meats/veggies/fresh herbs and you just go through the assembly line and pick as many of each as  you want for $7. 95. The crust is thin with a cornmeal dusting on the bottom and the ingredients are fresh. Every time I've ordered red sauce gorgonzola, fresh mozzarella, parmesan, garlic and fresh oregano and each one has been great. They're not cheap with the toppings either which I almost expected given the price. . I haven't tried their salads yet but I'm sure they're just as good. . Fired Pie gives the better pizza places in the area a serious run for their money from a taste perspective which is surprising considering you can generally get out of there in about 10 minutes with a fresh and delicious pizza.","One of our favorites. We order pizza here a couple times a month. Dining there is always tasty. Nice variety of items on the menu. Gets very busy and a little noisy but worth it!. Highly recommend their catering services for parties. They work with various dietary restrictions, make excellent dishes for large groups. . Try to save room for true New York style cheesecake.","Basically the best, cheapest and quickest option for a solo lunch or dinner at the Aria. If you sit at the bar, you are able to order pizza by the slice. The bartender was friendly and efficient, and the prices are great by Vegas standards. I had a shake for dessert and it's definitely enough for two people to share. Yum!","We've been looking for good pizza near us for years now! And finally found it - way to go tailgaters! Absolutely one of the best pizzas I have ever had and they deliver to! There is a small delivery fee but it's well worth it. The pizza was delicious not greasy very complicated half-and-half ordered and perfectly and the delivery driver was very kind and friendly he promised a pizza would be delicious and it was! Can't wait to start ordering from them and try some of their other offerings!","I don't understand why they make people wait when the restaurant has plenty of empty tables. Additionally, I don't know why they put tables so close together then we someone is seated right next to us, two couples pretty much got up and left. And there were plenty of other tables to be seated at. The service was not up to par. . For that nonsense, this place gets a single \"*\" . However, the marguetta pizza was delicious with a great crust and the meatball app was very tasty. . I find the front of the house operations were poor.","Bon restaurent!. Nous y sommes aller le mardi soir et le restaurent \u00e9tait rempli! Le service est impeccable, l'ambiance chaleureuse. Nous avons command\u00e9 des calmars frits, qui \u00e9taient \u00e0 la hauteur de nos attentes! Seul hic, les pizzas sans sauce, \u00e0 mon avis, manquent de go\u00fbt: pour ma part, pizza aux l\u00e9gumes grill\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient plut\u00f4t \u00e9parses et peu go\u00fbteux, dommage.","The last several times we've eaten here it's been more or less a disappointment. The quality of food has definitely gone down hill. (The service was never very good, and tonight was no different). Our server acted as if we were inconveniencing her by being there. The spinach dip was the highlight of the meal. The pizza was fairly soggy and the house salad was less than desirable- a small was, however, enough for two people to share. But we were charged a dollar for dressing?? Really? WTF?! I think we'll skip Upper Crust next time around. . . .","Very yummy!!. Came in tonight around 6-6:30pm for a casual dinner. I love the style here - tapas/shareable portions of creative and delicious food! We ordered the short rib gnocchi, shrimp risotto, French fries and a date and artichoke wood fired pizza with jalape\u00f1o peppers. Honestly, Everything was amazing. Food came out within 10 minutes, service was excellent, and they got us in right away even in the busy CES convention craziness. The pizza and short rib were my absolute favorite.","Terrible terrible terrible. Shouldn't even be considered Manhattan pizza I am from NYC and let me tell you I know hat pizza in LV will never be NYC pizza but this was absolutely disgusting, the cheese was all over the place the pepperoni was like sandwich style the sauce was just all over it was a terrible pizza","Obsessed with their deep dish pepperoni pizza and can't beat the price. Super busy spot but hey, everyone working is hustling to get your food and take your order. May want to consider more chairs for waiting customers.","Forget the nay sayers below, this place is amazing! I had excellent service. The place was very clean as well. I needed something quick to go, so I ordered a personal pizza with mushrooms and a side of ranch. The pizza crust was light and fluffy like a croissant. Sounds weird, but it's actually amazing! I've never had crust like this before. Very tasty. The rest of the pizza was delicious as well. And yes, it was cooked all of the way through. They also were not stingy on the mushrooms, which I appreciated very much. Last but not least, their ranch dressing was fabulous. It tastes like its homemade! . I'm a picky eater and I highly recommend this place.","Not the worst but still depressingly bad pizza. They are open late for what that's worth","We had the Navi on to find a Dairy Queen downtown to grab a birthday cake. We ended up in a strip plaza and walked by this pizza place hole-in-the-wall and of course, seeing slices in the window, I had to walk in and check it out. I am still on the hunt for a \"more than\" decent piece of Calgary pizza. I found it tonight, ladies and gentlemen! I did not pay much attention to much else other than the slices looking at me from the glass case. No idea if the place was clean or not or if there was any seating. This was between me and the large, single piece of veggie looking at me in the eyeballs. LOL. The service actually was amazing as well. I am positive it was the owner over the counter boasting about his business and pointing out that he was voted Best Pizza and Donair in Calgary on his little sales flyer sheet. We got 2 large slices of za and a can of pop for a little over $9. Not bad at all. It traveled well and it well worth the buy. YUMMY! The cheese was the GOOD kind of mozza, firm and reheated nicely. Also, the crust was fresh - crispy yet pillowey where it needed to be and we just loved it. We got the veggie and the pep. Anxious to go back and try the Hawaiian - there just was not any available tonight. Great find, by accident no less. . 4 stars.","Came here for a friend's b-day. We had a large group out on the patio and food and service were great plus the prices are really reasonable. Something that stood out immediately was how authentic the place is. All the staff were speaking in Italian - always a good sign! We loved our server from Capri who was warm and friendly. He made recommendations with confidence, telling me friend that if she didn't like the lasagne he would pay for it himself! The location is a bit hidden in the midst of hospitals and office buildings. The indoor seating area is actually very spacious and the patio is nice. Highlights included the Calamari alla Marinara and Pappardelle with mushrooms, asparagus and walnuts in a creamy sauce. People raved about the pizzas and cannolis. They actually let us do separate bills, which made life easier. All in all, a solid dining experience and I would certainly be back.","My fellow yelpers have yet to steer me wrong . Trattoria Reggiano was an absolute delight as our last meal in Vegas. The flavors and consistency of their sauces is what going out for Italian is all about! I had the Baked Ziti entree with a side salad- caesar of course. My friend ordered the tortellini alfredo. . We arrived without a reservation around 930pm on a Friday night. We were seated immediately with no issues. There were a variety of menu options to choose with a primary focus on pasta and pizza dishes. Prices very between $10-22 depending on your level of hunger. But considering it's Vegas (inside the Venetian hotel at that) the prices were moderately fair. . Our server was very attentive and courteous throughout our visit and the service was excellent. I would say we were in and out within 45mins-- I'm serious. . Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot for an inexpensive, highly satisfying Italian dinner. The walk along the way also helps too. Soo many photo ops!","You want some great east coast pizza, the kind that you slightly bend to keep from folding downward at the tip of the slice? This is definitely a nice neighborhood joint for some good pizza. They sell it by the slice or whole pie and offer more than just pizza. From appetizers like garlic knots to lasagna, they have some good italian cuisine. They even have a fridge near the entrance with ready made lasagna and sauces for you to take home. They even make gelato and sorbet! . I ordered a pepperoni pizza to go and when I picked it up it was piping hot!  I had to have a slice in the car and it was yummy. Nice, salty pepperoni and that grease that some people dab off on the cheese--yum yum yum!. It was good and well priced. I haven't tried their other dishes, but there were lots of people sitting in their dining area eating pizza pockets and lasagna, so I'm assuming it's really good. . People have very different opinions about pizza, so you may not be the one to like greasy, thin crust, NY style pizza, but if you are give this place a try.  . PS: they also sell fresh pizza dough. just ask if you need some for a recipe of your own.","Very nice atmosphere with friendly staff. Nice for a casual date night, not so much for a quiet romantic meal. Wonderful wine, beer and cocktail selection. Meatball appetizer was delicious, might order it as a meal next time. Would have liked the bread more if it had some kind of garlic butter spread instead of olive oil dip. Salchicha pizza was OK maybe because I personally like my pizza full of toppings. There was only one small piece of sausage per slice, if that. Appetizer and Entree's took a little longer than expected, and I wasn't starving. Got buzzed off my drinks even before I got my food, lol. Will definitely give it a 2nd try, especially when it's cool enough to open the Bay windows. Will re-review at that time.","Wanted to like this place. Pizza was ok but not seating. Walk back and forth if you want a beer and or wine had to walk back and forth between buildings was so so. I love Joe's but this was a pain to just get a slice of pizza a beer and a glass of wine too much!!!!!","NEVER ORDER DELIVERY. This is the second time we ordered pizza for delivery from Caliente. This is also the second time we waited for 2 hours for our pizza to arrive and it arrived cold. We live less than 10 minutes away from the restaurant, probably closer to 5 minutes. Both times we called after an hour and a half and they told us \"it is out for delivery now\". We will never order from here again. The pizza is not cheap and to wait two hours for a cold pizza is absolutely ridiculous. The only reason this doesn't get 1 star is because the pizza is really delicious when you go to the actual restaurant. Extremely disappointed.","Wow what a great experience! The crew totally explained all of the different ingredients I asked about and hooked the pizza up super fat with excellent portions. They even let me try a sample of the new plant based protein which I'm definitely getting on my next pizza. Cole and Hannah were absolutely amazing in the customer service department. . The pizza tastes bomb as always. Yes I'm writing this review while here. I suggest you get your butt over to this Fired Pie for an incredible pizza. Do it!! Lol. Thanks very much! I'll be back for sure!","We decided to have the three course meal. for 20 it was a great value. Started with a melon, prosciutto avocado salad which was amazing. Added garlic knots and went way past my expectations. . cheesy soft inside and crunchy outside. We had the gotham and the forager personal pizza's. Both were yummy. The cons were it took forever ti get out food. Not even the appetizers came out quick. They didn't make the right pizza I ordered so they brought out the one they made and made up for it by making a bigger one of one I ordered. I would definitely come again.","Finally a good real Italian restaurant in Las Vegas! I was born and raised in Italy so I'm very picky when it comes to Italian food, and I can honestly say that Trattoria Italiana is my favorite Italian restaurant. It's family owned and that gives that personal touch that you can't find in the chain restaurants; I met Milena, her husband Ninni, her brother Pasquale, her son Giovanni, Laura the waitress, and they were all so nice to me and my family! I like the atmosphere because it feels like being in a real Italian trattoria, I like the table clothes on the tables (typical in Italian restaurants but not here in the states), the bread is phenomenal, they make it with pizza dough and it's still warm when they bring it to the table, and the list goes on. I and my family will definitely go back to Trattoria Italiana!","Ordered and picked up many times. Not sure why the 3 star average but great service and great pizza. It's take out people!","Tasty, delicious, plus the powdered sugar deserts with the pizza crust were outstanding. Thankful that you were so close to Red Rock and the freeway. I ate your pizza down Charleston all the way to the Vegas Valley Book Festival. After Summerlin's Saturday Halloween party with the children at the city event, I did not want to deal with the traffic in Downtown Summerlin so I am glad that I remember the New York City Pizza at Rocco's off Charleston. Did you see the little bikes? Some children rode their bicycles to order pizza and eat it on the outdoor patio. What a great weekend in Summerlin. Earlier Councilman Bob Beers was playing bass in a music band for the families at the park by the pool. Swimming in October, only in Las Vegas.","I love their pizzas. They have good quality toppings and their crusts are thin. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very chill and the staff is very friendly.","I don't typically weigh my opinion of food of a chain establishment in the same wavelength as that of a standalone kinds. But I felt this one needed its due recognition!. Tried pizza here twice now, Chicken Fresco and Deluxe Uno and both times a take out. Still, the folks were very pleasant and you got the vibe that they actually enjoyed what they were doing (Go to the KFC or Mcdonalds nearby and you'll see what I mean). It makes a positive first impression on you!. The pizza themselves were attractive to begin with. Yes I just called out their \"look\" because it shows the effort put into making it. The crust was pleasantly fresh, airy and well balanced on the crunchiness-doughiness ratio. The ingredients were fresh, and amazingly \"marinated\" for some of the proteins!! The sauce was spot on and the free extra of butter/cheese crust toppings were a bonus!. In the end, I'd say, please keep up the good work you guys are doing as it's better than any pizza hut or dominos I've had in a while!","Although the service was very bad, the food was  good. The rating reflects the overall experience As a family. . One Friday evening we decided to go out for dinner as a family. My husband, our 2 young children and myself. . We had called ahead to reserve and as usual make sure they could accommodate my food allergies. The person we spoke to was not polite or professional, but said yes. And since we've been planning on giving this place a chance for quite a while now we decided to go ahead Anyway. . When we arrived we found the entrance to the restaurant was extremely awkward, you walk through what seems to be a tunnel due to the /temp/portable walls they had put up on two sides and then you suddenly feel like you're in the middle of the restaurant. No one there to greet you or see you. We felt like we were standing in the way of the staff and were very i'm comfortable and uncertain if anyone will even sit us. . Eventually my husband got the attention of one of the waiters and have mentioned that we have reservations And would like to be seated. They sat us the very back of the restaurant, it seemed semi private and quiet which we preferred due to the fact that we were there with young children. the majority of the restaurant seemed to open concept and everyone was seated very closely and seemed somewhat uncomfortable to be there. The back of the restaurant where we were seated seemed like it was a temporary location for clientele, it almost seemed borderline like a storage area and they had opened another yet temporary wall to create more seating. Our table was a very wobbly and so were the chairs. Which was not a huge deal but we would assume that they could correct that in a very simple manner. Once seated down, we had waited for our waiter for quite a while until  he finally showed up and realized we were sitting with no menus, he finally went and got us some menus and yet again left us sitting there. He later on came to take our drink order but we were there with her children who are very hungry and it was getting very late so we simply wanted to get the orders in and get the food cooking. To our surprise, He had  let us know that there are no children's menus and we would have to order from the regular menu. We had asked him if he could possibly create something simple for the children like a pasta with some cheese, to his confusion and misunderstanding we had eventually came to common ground agreement and they created a simple penne with too much butter. And sprinkled dried Parmesan, not fresh. Our other child wanted to have pizza and we asked if there was anyway to make a small pizza for a child,  and we had to order the regular size pizza which cost about 10 or $11. My husband and I we decided to start off with a drink and an appetizer each. Also we have heard their dinner specials and decided to order from there, much later after appetizers were eaten, our waiter shows up with an apology trying to explain that they have run out of the dinner specials and that we should order something else. With it getting late, and a rough start for the server, My husband and I had  exchanged looks at one another in confusion as to why it took him so long to announce that, and the fact that our children were pretty much done eating. . . . We decided not to make a fuss and go ahead and order something else. Each time the waiter would come to clear our plates he would give me a very strange look in surprise and confusion as to how I would manage to eat all that food. (Awkward!!) He was impressed/shocked yet I don't believe it was in a positive way. Overall we were disappointed that our children are forced to order from the main menu which was quite overpriced for a $10 penne with butter which they didn't even like!  and a $10 boring cheese pizza , and neither  did  include a drink, They had given us very tiny glasses, each one had ice tea in it they had charged us $2. 50 each with no refills. We thought that it was a very steep and unnecessary. At the very end of our dinner although the service was terrible the food was still good, we had mentioned that the food was good but we wish that they would accommodate a children's menu or consider half portions for young children who could not eat that much and we felt that a lot of food went to waste. We also mentioned that we eat out often and majority of family restaurants cater to families w/ children  and offer children's menus places such as Moxie's , the waiter went ahead and compared Moxie's to McDonald's and Burger King and said that they could afford to do so, and went on a rant about how it's very expensive and not worth their while to do so and that he has been in business (serving) for a very long time to know. . We tried to correct him by letting him know that we have family Who own restaurants and we know for a fact That a children's menu including a drink would literally not cost them very much and would bring in more clientele, and more families on weekdays!","Rino D's and I go way back, to right when they first opened. They've been our family's go-to pizza place for over a decade (though NYPD has really brought it with regards to pizza) and we still hit Rino D's about once a month or every other month. . This has to be said: Rino D's has categorically the best hot wings in the valley. (And frankly, likely the entire state. ) They are HUGE, with their delicious sauce (which I believe is based on the Frank's Red Hot original style, true to real wing form), and most importantly, they're perfectly cooked. . So many wings (I'm looking at you, Vine) are previously-frozen, dingy little sticks of sadness, slathered in sauce after the fact. Only Rino D's makes them perfectly, cooked in the sauce and then fried up properly. They're simply amazing, and they never freeze their chicken--it's their secret to success with the wings, and you honestly CAN. NOT. find better out here. . The pizza is a slightly more meddling affair. I'd recommend that you ask for it with thick crust (available on sizes up to large), and try their garlic butter crust flavoring. The pizza is damn decent, fresh, and well cooked, and the staff is always really nice. It doesn't scream out and grab me like NYPD's amazing pies do, but they're also slightly different in style. . All-in-all Andy &amp; company have done amazing things with this tiny space. The wings are serious showstoppers. Get 'em hot and they'll ruin you for all other wings. The pizza is damn good, the prices are right, and the staff is fast and friendly. Great neighborhood pizza joint.","Star Rating: 2. 5 because it is between \"Meh. I've experienced better\" and \"A-Ok\". Long Winded Experience: I have been patronizing this establishment since I was in High School over ten years ago. Our favorite pizza of choice is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. It's extremely delicious, but over the last ten years we have experienced lack-luster presentation and portions from Beach Pizza with this pizza specifically. They treat the chicken pieces like precious metals, sprinkling just a few bits here and there to add \"sparkle\" to what can only be called a Ranch/Cheese pizza, not a Buffalo Chicken Pizza. We've even asked, every time since the 2nd or 3rd time ordering it, for *extra* chicken. They go ahead and charge us $5 for extra chicken, but the pizza looks just like if you order it without extra chicken. It's completely disappointing and frustrating. The pizza is very delicious and a unique specialty pie, but is it worth $25 for an 18\" pizza that only has a smattering of Buffalo Chicken on it? I think not. Sorry, Beach Pizza. You have a wonderful concept, and a talented team to pull it off, but you skimp on toppings that make the pizza. My friends and I have eaten our last of Beach Pizza. . TL;DR: Delicious Specialty Pizza, but lacks sufficient \"Bang-for-your-buck\" in the toppings department for the price and \"Extra toppings\" vanish into thin air as you pay for them.","Definitely won't be coming back. We came in to celebrate a friends birthday. We ordered the Caesar salad- dressing tasted like mayo :/,  fried calamari appetizer- over cooked, the garlic knots- tasted decent, but we waited 30 minutes for the \"dough to rise\"(?), pineapple and prosciutto pizza- gross, cardboard tasting crust, and the meat lovers pizza- gross, but not as bad as the other pizza. . The service was awful, and our waitress had ZERO customer service skills.","Me and my gf had the papajoun and the newly established popeye joun. I must say, I love the dough, it makes for thin and crispy delicious pizzas. The salad I had was something different, but I liked it. The owner suggested I wrap the grainy salad in Roman lettuce for extra crispness. The prices are very reasonable, the owner is cheerful and friendly. All in all, we are looking forward to our next visit. It's worth trying it out. You can buy a dozen of those mamajoun pizzas for $15 and warm them up at home in the oven.","We were also in a lazy mood and ordered in. . . The pizza came more quickly than we had anticipated! Which was good because we were hungry. . . About 3 bites in a found a long dark hair in my pizza. . . My wife trying to make me feel better assured me that it was probably hers. We both knew it wasn't. We started feeling much less hungry and as my wife went to throw the rest of the pizza away she found a big, black, nasty fly baked right in. . . Yum! . Maybe they were just having a bad day. . . But regardless we won't be ordering from them again. . . My wife makes better homemade pizza anyways. . .","I don't normally write reviews on yelp unless I have a bad experience. So I will start taking these things serious. This place was good pizza was good got the chicken bacon ranch (mozzarella instead of cheddar) but it was good. . wings were ok but pizza was quality tasting. I would order again.","We had dinner here one night and it was amazing. The Asian chicken salad is awesome, and the pizza is out of this world. We would have eaten there more often, however just like everything else at Caesars, it's overpriced. $20+ for a BLT. No thanks.","Had pizza here last night . . Not the  best Pizza Pizza place. . . I prefer the one at Broadview and Danforth. . they put less pizza sauce. . . but the customer service here is good. . The Guy working last night was super friendly. .","Great pepperoni pizza. Large slice, small price. Attentive service, love the smell of the ovens !  Doesn't get much better in the burgh. Been there alone, or with friends or family. Predictably good every time.","My husband and I tried this place on a whim last night. And I'm glad we did! We loved it! We sat at the bar, had a couple drinks, and some delicious pizza! I love the vibe and decor, very nice but laid back. The bartender rocked, too! I had the blood orange margarita and my husband had the lumberjack Hefeweizen. We were both impressed by the drinks and service. My husband got the meat lover pizza and I got the pesto party pizza. Service and food was awesome! We'll be back!","great pizza place. . simple and easy. . Plaza has some great places to eat. . . best downtown","I want to LOVE this place but I just like it. Each time I've dined here the pizza dough has been inconsistent. Once burned and over cooked, once stretched thin and thick, and the other time a disproportionate amount of toppings. I love fired pizza but haven't been crazy impressed yet by their pizza. I adore the beet salad and also liked the season burratta and heirloom tomato salad. The environment is funky and has a cool vibe and the service is decent.","The boyfriend and I were big fans! We came after finding them at a Yelp event with a free pizza certificate. Assuming it was for a personal size, we were shocked we could order a large so we did! The boyfriend was impressed with the beers on tap and happy watching three games at once in HD. I was really impressed with our server Jonathan. He was fantastic and knowledgable. He had the chef slice some mozzarella made in house so I could revive some Bronx little Italy memories. It was not quite there but I was really impressed by the effort. The ravioli with meat sauce was quite good. We can't wait to try the lasagna next time! As for pizza, the peperoni was more impressive than the margarita but both fared well and I cannot wait for leftovers!","Very neat atmosphere with awesome decor. Service was good, though maybe not as quick as would be expected from how busy they were at the time. Food was good and we thoroughly enjoyed it, however, I would not say it was anything particularly exceptional, especially for the price. We did really enjoy the Nutella pizza we ordered for dessert. It was simple (just pizza dough, Nutella, and icing sugar) but the dough was really nice. Overall, we very much enjoyed our experience though it wasn't particularly unique or out of this world.","Great staff, super accommodating with kids too! The margherita pizza had a wonderfully crispy, yet light crust. Also if you have kids who like pasta with butter you can rest assured; our guys said it was the best butter pasta they've ever had. To those who know what it's like to have picky kids, this place is a godsend.","Maybe not the best pizza I've had, but it's definitely yummy, especially if you're very hungry. If you're getting a single slice beware that it's not that large--definitely order two. I was hungry again within hours of finishing mine. Both times I used the MYVEGAS reward to get a free slice and beer. This second time around I passed on the beer since they no longer had cider as an option and the only choice was miller lite and some other regular beer (ew). But for only 7000 points I cant complain. I ordered the forager and it was delicious.","my Husband told me about this place since he has had it before and i haven't. i love pizza so when i find something i like i stick with it. . well fat bobs was amazing. .  the owners were really nice and even chatted with us for a couple.   the pizza is amazing. . ive had my share of pizza and its not like any other pizza places in town or in medina.    you wont be disappointed in going. .  the store was nice and roomy.","This place is definitely not your ordinary pizza place. Wow!!! Love at first Bite!. The name goes with the pizza. The crust was nice and Crisp, and you can tell they use quality ingredients . I would definitely recommend checking this place out! I now have a new favorite pizza place in the valley.","We love Marcello's as a dependable local spot. I wouldn't travel across town for it, but for neighbourhood families it's great. Pizzas are amazing, thin crispy crusts - I love the speck and arugula, kids love the margarita. . No, it's not pizza Libretto but there's usually nary a hipster to be found, just good food served quickly without much ceremony. They also offer smaller-portions of pasta for the kiddies; the gnocchi is a favourite of ours.","5 stars it is!   Best pizza in town! The house made mozzarella is the best and the service is always excellent.","Very nice ambience , lovely live music ( I went there on a Friday evening) , nice big wine menu . Had a variety of options ranging from pizza , Mediterranean and salads . Garlic bread was good , grilled asparagus was just OK and falafel sandwich could have been better but chickpea salad compensated for it .","First time trying. . . we were outside the delivery area but they said would deliver this one time! Awesome pizza, had a Supreme and Pepperoni and also fried ravioli and bacon bombs!! Really good. . good enough where I'll drive and pick it up!!","do not order from this location. i ordered a large grilled cheese stuffed pizza , i was called ad told that they are out of grilled cheese ad they only have regular cheese. i was annoyed because i wanted to try the new   product  but it was fine it happens . but this just the beginning the pizza was oily and soggy [check pictures ] . the previous time i ordered from this location the send me a pizza with the wrong toppings . this is a poorly manged location . what a waste of my money .","Not great pizza but fast pizza which is a great feature.   $5 for a classic pizza on demand is a good deal. You'd spend a lot more than that at a hamburger place. Its nice that you can drive up, get a pizza, and drive away in 5 minutes. The place can be a bit busy on a weekend night, so they may run out of classic pizzas, but its not a big wait for them to cook a batch up. They also have fancier pizzas, but I haven't tried one. Pizza Hut and the other chains can make better pizzas, but I like Little Caesar's price and speed.","This is our pizza place. We absolutely love their pizza and we eat here about 2 times a month. I love the location, it's right by my house, in the CVS lot at Charleston and Durango. I'll admit that it isn't that fancy on the inside but we never eat there so I really don't care. . I honestly don't know what it is that we love, but the pizza tastes so good! It's the crust and the sauce and the cheese. Aaahhhhh, cheeeese. The crust is a perfect thickness, not thick like a pan and not greasy at all and not too thin that it will snap or break in half. The slices are a great size and you can fold them!!! I love folding pizza, it just makes it taste so much better. . The cheese always tastes fresh and the sauce is neither sweet nor salty. . My husband always orders hot wings with our pizzas and he thinks they taste great. They also have these 2 foot pizzas that are made for large parties. Huge pizza!. We have never had any rudeness with any employees and they have always been nice to us. . I can't comment on the delivery because we haven't had delivery in so long since we live so close to the restaurant. . Highly recommend!","Wow, what a great surprise! Few places have we loved everything we ordered and the service was outstanding as well. Fungi pizza with tomatoes added and the Toscano meatballs with linguini - awsome! This was our first time and we'll certainly be back to try the other unique items on the menu.","Attended a retirement party in mid September and the smaller Hall used was appropriate for the event. The outside scenery is very nice especially during spring, summer and fall however, they need some upkeep in order to maintain the place. I saw cracks to their foundation and stairs were in disrepair. This is their major selling point. . Food and service need major improvements. The food was served in a buffet style heating pans as the menu consisted of some chicken (fried and in sauce), pasta, salad and vegetables. The dinner food was either salty or bland. The pasta was overcooked and doused in sauce. The appetizers were a little better and consisted of bread crumb covered shrimp, arancini and small pizza slices. Overall, I rate the food below average. . Service was uneven. The servers were okay and for the most part, they were attentive. The staff was a mix of students and older people. However, in the middle of the retirement speech, the bartender in the cash bar and the kitchen staff were having a loud conversation that we could hear and was interrupting the speech giver. The speech giver had to stop and tell the staff to be quiet. Very unprofessional and rude! I thought it was common sense to be quiet but it's obvious some people don't have that. . It's a shame since the outside grounds is beautiful and with proper food and staff, this place could become a 5 star hall.","Have frequented this place several times and felt it was time to give a review. . I have noticed the last few visits that my pizza is burned black around the crust and/or doughy and limp in the middle so inconsistent baking here folks!  Ordered a calzone last night and it was bland, no garlic AT ALL and the dough was limp and the filling all kept falling out - not a true calzone!  . My biggest gripe about this place is the revamped pick-up and take-out process. You have to walk into the bar, jump up and down to get noticed to let them know you are there to get your order, be made to feel like you are interrupting the staff be being there, play cat and mouse trying to stay out of the way of everyone while you are backed up to a wall next to the bar waiting for an ungracious server to bring you your meal. Then you play a balancing act trying to hold the bill and pen in hand to sign the receipt which you can't see because you are in a dark corner. I've decided not to return after the rude manner in which I was treated by the staff last night and I know they get a large part of biz from take-out. Better re-think this part of the process there, I'm sure other patrons do not return for the same reasons. Go back to bringing take-out the the front hostess stand on the restaurant side of the place like you used to and make even your PAYING take-out customers feel appreciated!","Came here for a late night snack. . . . and thank goodness we came right before midnight on a Saturday night because the restaurant closes at midnight. Really? This is Vegas! Nothing should ever close!. We perused the menu and didn't think it was worth sitting down in the restaurant when it was just the two of us so stood in the line for pizza by the slice. We got one slice of all the pizzas available. . . so there was barely any pizza left after we finished. We came during the rush so you would think they would be preparing more pizzas.  . We noticed that the person who ordered before us had their pizza warmed up. This was never offered to us. The pizza slices aren't too expensive but for how greasy and bland the pizza is, I wouldn't have even paid the $6/slice and would have just starved until the morning and eaten at a buffet. . The white pizza was gross (cold, hard/flavorless cheese). The slice with sausage and pizza was greasy. The margherita pizza was completely forgettable. Eating here just made me angry thinking about the other pizza option across the way. . . Accept no imitations. There's only one true great pizza in Vegas. And this place isn't it.","The hubby and i were looking for a pizza place that served greek food AND hot wings. . . . DIng, ding, ding, we have a winner!. Orders hot wings (with fries), Gyro (with fries) &amp; jalapeno poppers. . Ordered over the phone for pick up. Gave special instructions for the gyro (only lamb, sauce and lettuce, no onions or tomatoes). Wanted my hot wings medium and extra ranch. . The gyro was for the hubby, so i didnt try it. He stated that it was good with lots of lamb but the cucumber sauce was lacking something. . We both ate the jalapeno poppers and i have to say they were the best poppers i've ever had. No joke. So soft, yet crunchy. So juicy and good. The sour cream inside was perfect! Gosh, i want some now!! They tasted homemade, not bought. Being a foodie, i can tell the difference. . The fries were good. Not soggy, but crunchy. Their ranch is good. Plus they followed the instructions and gave us extra. . for no charge! I personally thought they gave way too many, I couldnt eat them all. I guess i should stop complaining. . My wings were good. At first sight I thought what a rip because it looked as if they had no sauce. But then I noticed the sauce was some what at the bottom and once I tasted them I realized it was the perfect amount. It made them nice and sauced, not soggy. It was a good amount and i left 2, which my hubby ate. . The prices at this place are well worth it. . It only took 15 minutes for our food to be ready. Pretty good, normal amount of time. . Will we be back?! of course. next time we shall try the pizza.","Sunday brunch buffet was very solid here. When you order the buffet you also are able to pick one item ala carte. We picked Texas toast eggs Benedict and French toast. Both were good. . From the buffet we had mussels, biscuits and gravy, flat bread pizza, and a few other assorted items. My favorite by far was the biscuits and gravy. The service was great and the atmosphere casual. Plenty of seating indoor and out. . For whatever reason all the food was either cool or cold, even the ala carte dishes. The coffee was warm :)","Papa johns on anthem is closed. So surprised. Will be missed. Was only pizza place close to anthem. I can't rate it seeing it gone. Sad now that I have to make my own pizza and nobody likes it. Certain things I can't cook is Chinese and pizza because of the crust. How sad. Hope to see them back.","I visited the Scottsdale restaurant on a recent vacation and the pizza i had was the best pizza i ever had, it was so good, i had another pizza in the Humble Pie in the Phoenix airport. Great pizza, great prices great everything.","Best pizza in Hudson!  Pepperoni and meatball are the best toppings. . The pasta is good too, big enough to split, but the bread sticks/twists are bland and soggy.","Hidden in the very far back of the Aria is Five50 Pizza Bar. Not busy and therefore we were sat quickly. Ordered a wheat beer recommended by server. The pint was 9. 00 and was pretty tasty I must say. Water is filtered and comes out of a fancy bottle without ice. We ordered the chopped salad and Gothom Pizza. The chopped salad was enough to split at 14. 00. It was full of Italian meats and cheeses and you even could find some tasty greens. It was mighty good. We also shared the Gothom pizza (priced at 28. 00) which was 16 inch topped with a variety of Italian meats. It was thin crust right out of the very hot oven. Tasted like it came from New York and although we were stuffed we enjoyed it to the very last bite. There is no reason to not give this place a 5 star but the management had only one server for the restaurant. As good as he was he was over worked.","First of all the only reason I didn't give a one star is because I've never gotten sick at this place. . I've lived in the neighborhood since they opened and have ordered numerous items but the pizza is a regular item for me. There is something wrong with their ingredients apparently because the pizza doesn't taste anything like New York style or anything else for that matter. The pizza dough is completely tasteless and is undercooked to the point of being watery. But it has to be the sub-standard ingredients because pizza from a place that is called \"New York Pizza\" should not taste like this. The cheese also is totally devoid of any taste whatsoever. . Although, from the outside this place looks so very inviting. The lighting, layout and all, it sets really high expectations. . . which are quickly dashed the minute you dive into your meal. It's like they really don't know, or care, what they are doing. . While dining in the staff seems like they have better things to do than, well, waiting on tables. Rushing out, dropping off whatever you order and rushing off to hide behind the veil. . But the main reason I will NEVER order from them again is the pizza has NO taste whatsoever. Sorry Mark Rich, New York should not be in your title. . . and neither should pizza for that matter. . . adios!","My first weekend in Montreal and I had discovered Petite Italia. With all the great aromas drifting down St. Zotique my choices for dinner were limitless. One in particular had an old-school brick oven and that was good enough for me - don't worry, I plan to hit every other restaurant on that street eventually. . The atmosphere was casual inside and out, with diners ranging from couples to familes to after work socials. I was pathetic dining by myself and had no choice - what to do except ask for a table for one. The maitre d' (who may or may not have been the owner. . . ) sat me at a table right next to the kitchen. Talk about \"dinner and a show. \" For a saturday night it was fairly busy and when I offered not to take up a 4-top by myself to sit at the bar, he replied, \"No sir, sit, relax and enjoy your meal. \" Can't argue with that. . Stephanie, my waitress, took very good care of me. Looking around I saw a lot of dishes that looked great. . . from the fried zucchini flowers(?) to the pizzas to teh calamari. . . so much to sample next time. I may also be the first person to review Bottega without being able to comment on their pizza since I ordered a glass of wine and a calzone. Without hesitation it was quite possibly one of the best calzones I've ever had. To top the night off, I finished with the hazelnut gelato and that was pure heaven. . Now the hard part; I was a bit surprised when the bill came and the cheapest glass of wine, a plain mushroom &amp; meat calzone with a cup of gelato along with tip came to over $50 for one person. I'm still learning what constitutes cheap vs expensive in this city so don't let this fool you though - I try to get the most for my money wherever I go. It's pricey in my opinion but the service and atmosphere were great. The food/dessert was amazing and I did not walk out of there still hungry. It's a great place to visit once and a while or for special occasions. Plus, I moved in down the street after that night so there's a good chance I'll be back.","Ordered a double-pep. w/pineapple. When I picked-up pizza, opened box and it certainly didn't look like a double-pep. and certainly not like the picture. . . . not even close. This pizza was barely a single-pep. and when I ask if was a single or double, the guy said it was a single pep. Reminded him I ordered a double and then he said, oh guess it is a double-pep!. . . . . but it wasn't. Pretty tasteless and paid for something that wasn't right. Will not be going back.","This is my closest Pizza Pizza, so whether I like it or not - this is the one I get delivery from. . First of all, I like Pizza Pizza. That helps. People who review Pizza Pizza but don't like the pizza from here - you're not going to have a good experience!  There's a lot I like about it - I like the topping choices, I like the price point, I LOVE that you can order online and make all the customizations you want online. I even like their pasta and chicken nuggets. So I'm a fan of the product. . The actual service is hit and miss. I've had creepy delivery men who've asked if I was home alone. Don't even get me started if they're past the 40 minute mark - then you're basically going to get killed in your home (the delivery man pays for your pizza if you get it for free, so they get VERY MAD AT YOU if you try to enforce this policy). One time the cook called me and asked me to pick it up because his delivery man got into an accident, and I was like, \"But the whole point of ordering is that I don't WANT to go pick-up?. . . . . \"  seemed strange. . I still order from here because, Hell, they're open really late and sometimes you crave a creamy garlic sauce base on your pizza. But it's not without annoyance.","This is one of my favorite lunch spots. Their pizza is great! Their salads are packed full of the good stuff, with the best house dressing around. The staff are very friendly and my favorite part is you are asked what you want to drink right away and don't forget the glasses are HUGE! There is nothing worse in restaurants than small glasses and the impossibility of getting a refill!. I have ordered many different kinds of pizza from this Nellos and have yet to be disappointed. The buffalo chicken pizza is so tasty and they will give you extra buffalo sauce and ranch all you have to do is ask. They will make you pizza any way you like it and the wait is never that long. I am always able to keep my lunch at an hour, which of course makes my boss happy!. Don't forget the salads that come piled high with meat, cheese and tons of veggies, you never feel you paid too much for a salad once you dig in! Their dressing is pinkish orange and just superb! . In a part of town that is lacking great places to eat lunch, I am glad Nello's is in my neighborhood!","This is the best pizza I have had in the valley yet, plenty of cheese sauce and toppings. I will be returning.","Best thin crust pizza I've had in a very long time!!! Cheaper than most places we have been as well. Wed is the day to go for cheap wine/pizza. . . just an FYI. Also we always get the same waiter and he's very friendly! Never disappointed with this place. Don't understand the low ratings on this location???","One of the best pizzas I've had. Amazing crust! The owner are staff are super friendly and take pride in their food. This place won't disappoint!","Twice now we've used CHAR to cater a pizza party and they were terrific. Twelve pizzas all piping hot, ready on time, great crust, and fresh and delicious ingredients. Today, we actually came in and sat down to eat. Happy Hour bruschetta? Delicious. Caprese salad was a little heavy on the balsamic, but the HH cocktails? Didnt care for the Lake Pleasant; however, the Sicilian Delight was favolosa! Thanks for changing the background music. Heavy metal or whatever it was you had on just didn't go with such a yummy late lunch.","I just visited this pizza shop for the first time and it surpassed all of my expectations. Being a frequent Dominoes eater, I forgot what real pizza was. I hadn't been there before, so naturally I asked a lot of questions. Shaun answered all of them and recommended multiple variations. He let me and my friend customize a giant pizza (20\") by allowing us to do half and half. . They have a ton of great toppings that I couldn't choose between, so I ended up getting 5 on my half. It was one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten. Jerald made our pizza and we were able to watch the entire time. When it was finished, he delivered it to the table and made sure we had everything we wanted. . They have an awesome, welcoming dining area that features an open concept, and a massive pizza oven, comparable in size to a small apartment. This allows you to literally see every step of the process. I've never been to a pizza shop that is completely open like this. . I'm a pretty big guy, weighing over 200 lbs and was completely stuffed after 2 slices. . This place is incredible. I know they have salads and wings, but can't comment on those items as I only had the pizza. Definitely worth a visit. I don't think I'll be ordering budget pizza anymore.","This was a solid three-star review until I ate the sfogliatella pastry I took to go from the bakery and I had to bump it up to four stars. We were starving after a long morning of basketball, video poker and bloody marys (me), and sleeping until noon (my friend). So, we stopped in here because they had smallish things to eat - salads, sandwiches, soups, etc. I opted for the spinach and brie panino and was delighted that it came with a side of house salad. My friend ordered a pizza and a full-sized house salad. My panino was very good. It was also very cheesy and rich (the brie) so I couldn't finish it all. The side salad was very nice (lettuce, basil, olives, onions, tomatoes). My friend's pizza was pretty decent - not the best thin Italian-style pizza but still pretty good. It had a nice, fresh tomato sauce which I liked a lot. . The service was good although it took a while for them to get to us. But, overall it was fine. When I went in to the bakery later to get a treat to take away, the ladies behind the counter were very sweet, friendly and helpful. They were so great that I returned the next day to get another sfogliatella. Or, maybe it was the pastry that made me return because it was delicious :)","I normally do not like to write a bad review about a restaurant; however, I feel the need to warn people about this place. . I went to eat lunch at Beach Pizza yesterday and the service was good, but the restaurant was dirty and the food was awful. The pizza was not fully cooked and the dough was raw.","This place is hit and miss. Some items are amazing while others are 'meh'. So far, I have really only tried their pizza and pizza rolls. I would definitely recommend their sproccoli pizza roll (tons of cheese); it is yummy!  . Keep in mind their portions are big. To be honest, you could probably split a meal between two people. I am pretty sure there is an additional cost there to split your meal though (a couple bucks), which is lame. . I would go there again, but I am not dying to go back either. It is worth trying, but you may want ask your waiter for recommendations to make sure you get the right stuff.","I love this place!. It's fast but good. . . the choices and prices are great and they serve wine!. I can in with my husband and best friend and 4 kids. . . . everyone was super helpful and nice to all the kids!. My only suggestion. . . . when someone orders the spicy sauce (diavolo) like I did. . . I wish they would have told me to mix it with the regular sauce. . . . . my pizza was on fire and I like spicy so I really couldn't enjoy my custom pizza (my mouth was on fire). . . . . . but thank GOD I ordered the awesome margherita pizza as a back up. . Can't wait to go back!!!","This place is awesome! My husband and I wanted to try something new for our first date night in a long time. We usually stick to our usually venues but we decided to take a chance on something we've never tried before and were pleasantly surprised at how great everything was. The atmosphere was so lively from the welcoming staff to the others around us enjoying their meals. I love the decor and how open everything is. . Our server, Patrick was fantastic. He was super friendly and gave us the run down as first timers and even though he seemed extremely busy, he never neglected to make sure our waters were immediately refilled and that we had everything we needed. I loved how all the staff paid attention to other tables and helped out even though it wasn't their table. You could tell they all worked together great which really makes a difference. . The food was OMG awesome! We had the cauliflower appetizer which was seasoned perfectly and had a really nice light crunch to it. My husband ordered the house fish which he must have really enjoyed because it wasn't on his plate for very long. I had the white pizza. I was really surprised with the flavor. It wasn't at all what I was expecting or have ever experienced with white pizza before from other places. I really enjoyed it even though I couldn't finish it all. . I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an upbeat new age place to eat with classic Italian dishes.","Probably the best place to get a pizza in the Ahwatukee area. It does get rather busy though.","We just went there just because . We never heard of this place but ended up loving their pizza . It was so cheesy and had perfect amount of sauce. Good sizes for Large and medium. . They have other options beside pizza: cheese bread, chicken wings, garlic breads, pakoras , fried chicken etc. . Bonus is that, they are halal and does delivery","I love pizza, so Anthony's is definitely one of my favorite places to go! My boyfriend come here often and recently we had a large pizza with mushrooms and sausage. Their sausage is so good! We've had the wings before, which are the perfect amount of crisp and flavor! They used to serve bottles of pop (or soda. . . . ), which we loved but have recently switched to fountain pop. Their drinks list looks awesome and I will have to try next time!","If it weren't for Triple D (Diners, Drive-ins and Dives), I wouldn't have visited this place when I went to go see rent at ASU.  However, this was probably one of my favorite parts of the excursion. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Sandwich for myself and accidentally ordered the Ahi Salad for my friend who hates fish. She ate every last bite of her meal. The sandwich was just as wonderful, but I could always use a little more kick from the wasabi (being the heat junky that I am). We also ordered the veggie pizza which I was lucky to get a slice of since the table devoured (with good reason) before I had my chance to attack. We ordered all the different fries they have. Sweet Potato and the Garlic were my favorite. However, you have to eat the Garlic when it's fresh, since the oil gives the fries a slightly rancid taste if it sits too long. Finally, I had to have desert (although I don't know where I found the room for it), a chocolate shake. It was your typical shake, but with the temperature in Arizona, it did wonders to cool me down. . When we were done, we looked at the farmers market and the houses in Agritopia. I have to say these people have one of the best places to live. Although I don't like the sun too much, I could easily be convinced to become an Arizonan for this!","My wife and I recently moved into the area, so my first move was to find the local coffee shop. Barista Craft is tucked on the corner of a small shopping center with grocery store and pizza place, but still is a cool unique spot. . I wasn't sure of their coffee and food offerings, but the woman at the cash register steered me toward their breakfast special, which on this day was a bacon or sausage, egg, and cheese bagel w/ tater tots and a small coffee for $8. 95. Not a bad deal in my opinion. I went with the bacon option and their house breakfast blend coffee. . The opted for the bacon, egg, and cheese bagel, which was good, but not a whole lot of flavor to be had. Might have just needed some more seasoning on the bacon or eggs. I have to say the same about the tater tots (which is a hilarious side item for breakfast). Bland, but they did offer ketchup so that helped. The coffee was good, standard. . They have an extensive menu of drinks that I'm looking forward to going back and trying including beer and (maybe?) wine. They have indoor and outdoor seating and good coffeehouse music to enjoy. A cool neighborhood place to grab a coffee and get some work done if you want to get out of the house or office.","Deluxe + black olive is my favourite also. The Mediterranean pizza is cool if you like feta cheese.","One of my favorite Pizza places in Pittsburgh. The sauce is one of the best I've had. . . and I'm originally from New Haven (home to some of the best pizza in the world) so I know what I'm talking about. Now granted, Aiello's is no Peppi's Pizza, it's still very good. Definitely overpriced and the \"cash-only\" thing is kind of annoying, but Hey, for Pittsburgh, if the Pizza doesn't look like an oil spill you should count your lucky stars.","The new owners of this place really put their heart, soul and what sounds like a few layers of skin into fixing up the place. It's been closed for quite a while. They have cleaned, painted, cleaned, renewed and cleaned the place! It's a little loud when you have many people in there, but worth the trip. There are TVs everywhere including a large center screen. The staff is friendly as well. I tried the turkey wrap, as is. They add dried cranberries to the wrap. . . wasn't sure how that was going to taste. After the first bite I was hooked! On the menu they have sliders (Philly cheez, burger or grilled cheese), apps, salads (including a grilled romaine salad that I've heard is to die for), sandwiches, pizza and more! There is a separate kids menu too. They are going to serve food late too - hard to find in that area. Definitely check this place out - even just to see what work was done.","Housed in a building that has been 3 pizza shops and a hotdog shop in the 7 years we've lived in Heidelberg, we ordered on 10/25 when I was responsible for watching my four kids for moms night out. I was pleased to see there was an online order form. . . The button was right in the middle of the heading of the page. My son and I browsed the fairly generic menu (all stock photos of cheese pizzas). I was surprised to see that there were no listed specials. . . We opted for a buffalo chicken and a cheese lovers. Total came to $34.  . I waited for 15 minutes and called to see how. I'd know when to pick up my order. The gentleman I talked to said that the website wasn't working, and he'd have to put the order in then. I asked him about specials, and they said they had two larges with one topping for $20. I ordered an extra cheese and a sausage. He told me 20 mins. . I went after 20 mins. The pizza was ready and being held in a delivery bag. The pizza was hot, total came to $20. 83. The lady behind the counter was friendly. . I took the pizza home and gave it to the real critics. . . My kids. The pizza is par. We prefer a little less sauce. It was slightly acidic, but not overbearing. There were a couple of large chunks of stewed tomatoes, which didn't bother me. The crust is doughy, but not soggy. The cheese mix was adequate on the extra-cheese pizza, but it wasn't a lot. The sausage pizza had an impressive amount of sausage, but was lacking in cheese. The center of the pizza was nearly bare, just sauce and sausage. . It is average Pittsburgh pizza. Nothing amazing, and not bad. I would avoid using the website, unless you need a menu overview. . . But again, Pittsburgh pizza shop with a typical pizza / calzone / salad / fried stuff menu.  . In the store, which is carry out only, there was a menu with three coupons good until 12/31/15. One is for 2 XL 1 topping pizzas for $19. 99. One for four large 1 topping pizza's for $32. 99. One for  Lunch special, $5. 99 1 topping small pizza. . We'll likely order from here again, calling to order, simply because it is convenient. If they follow the path of the previous shops and their quality is depleted as time goes on, it likely will not last long. There are a lot of options in Heidelberg / Carnegie / Bridgeville for pizza. . . Pizza America is not Fiori's by a long shot, but it is better than Little Caesars.","Excellent pizza from what appears to be an independent pizzeria. Good prices, good pizza, and friendly owners.","Our favorite delivery pizza in Sun Prairie. Wings are meh. Get the Old World Pepperoni instead of the regular pepperoni.","Best. Pizza. Seriously. . Even my husband, the pickiest eater EVER, has switched from his usual Papa Murphys to Fired Pie to create his own pizzas (yes, plural). . Fired Pie's thin, flatbread crust is delicious and I love the variety of meats, cheeses and toppings. I feel you can indulge a little here without the guilt from other pizza places. . Good price at $8 and a new staple for me and the hubs for the occasional UFC fight night!","Amazing pizza! Amazing salads! Amazing food in general. Can't beat a huge slice from a 28\" pie and a drink for $5! I come here for lunch weekly and wish I could come every day.","Another great addition to the 7th Street Market. Not only is this spot a great resource for finding wines but they do a great wine tasting every Tuesday evening between 5-7pm I think. It's $5 and they credit you with a voucher worth $5 towards any bottle. Can't really beat that.  . As far as selection it is a vary wide selection. As the normal, pinot, zins, cabs, etc. but also some rarer grapes that you can't find just anywhere. . During our visit we noticed that Pure Pizza was also giving out complimentary pizza during the wine tasting. . . that's a double score!","I used to go here all the time when i lived in California and im so happy its here in Vegas. I had a bbq chicken pizza which was so good. Crispy and lots of chicken. Its tased so fresh and love the salsa bar. Staff was super friendly. I love that i have a new spot to get sime great food!","Meh* I've had better.  . The location is convenient and that's the reason we went there after a playhouse concert.  . The location is nice and I like how it's open and the atmosphere ,  but that's about where the love ends.  . The stables are hard to get in and out of as they are low seating long benches. Took a while for service. And the food is not good. Pretty bad when child won't eat her pizza cause it tastes bad,  and neither will you! . Prices are steep as well.","Pretty standard for a British/Irish pub, with a younger more raucous crowd. This pub has Kronenbourg Blanc on tap, which deserves a resounding thumbs-up. The server was very friendly, and after mentioning YYC Pizza Week, the manager came out and chatted about their creation. The pizza was great and packed a nice punch, but the apple cobbler wasn't to our tastes. Another solid neighbourhood pub in the suburbs, with a good vibe and good intentions.","I ordered 2 large pizza's because they have a great deal going. My boyfriend and I eat pizza about once a week. I'd like to think I'm a connoisseur of pizza. Decided to order Dominos for something different. Pizza was doughy almost raw. Nasty tasting sauce and no flavor. Took a big bite and spit it out. I've never done that with pizza before. My boyfriend tried to put ranch, and hot sauce to make his taste better. Honestly was the worst pizza we've ever had. I immediately called the manager back. He kindly asked if I wanted something else. We decided on an order of hot wings, Italian sandwich, and a Philly. I was a bit reluctant to try anything else. The wings and sandwiches were alright. So this dominos can make mediocre sandwiches, wings, but horrible pizza hmmm? I was pleased with the manager and his attempt to make things right. This is the only reason for giving two stars. Will I order from them again NO.","So, i get that this is sort of a \"concept\" joint, with the biggest slices I've ever seen, but i don't care!. First, the dough. It's thin, but cooked PERFECTLY. The crust is doughy, light, and F R E S H tasting. The sauce is what i would say is traditional - not sweet or too packed with herbs. A nice layer is added to the za, deff not overwhelmingly saucy. The cheese is again, exactly what i think of when i think of a traditional za. Unlike some shops, they don't chuck on a lot. Just enough. Bubbled nicely, not too greasy. . I just got the cheese this time around. I'm embarrassed to say i couldn't finish the whole slice! Next time, going in on an empty stomach! . As an aside, i wonder if they will ever have pizza eating contests??","With my sister unable to travel due to being in hospice being told we are out of the service area after FIVE YEARS of delivery from the Weslake location, this disservice is disappointing. The westlake \"general manager\" is rude and needs to train their implores of setting needs to be set in place. Having been told \"if we aren't busy then we would\" doesn't mean anything when most of the time we order on Saturdays. Having worked in a pizza place, saturdays are the busiest days. . Thanks for allowing us to go with someone else!","I've been fighting with my family to come try this place for months, but it's hard to tell my family we are having pizza and it not be from Barros.  . So I finally talked them into it. We went on a Friday night and it was pretty busy. It's not really clear on the whole order and get food process. But it's not that big of a deal , you order in line, than they bring it out to you. But You have to get the silverware and plates and bring them to your table. . The pizza is a little on the expensive side, but it was good. The next morning my kids work up and asked if we could go back again for dinner. So we will be back.","This was an amazing experience and meal. First the service was excellent! We were told there would be a 30 minute wait so we decided to wait at the bar, we were seated within 10 minutes though and  were very happy. We order the Fritto Misto to start. This is shrimp prepared like calamari. It was delicious and our waitress commented that the white sauce with it was a must try. She was correct! It was delicious and the fried pepper slices in the dish were amazing too. For our meals we got the fettuccine and linguine and clams. The waitress said they were the two most popular dishes and it was easy to see why. The pasta is incredible and the sauces were so tasty. Our water glasses were always tended to and the food service was very quick. This restaurant was not open when we were here last time and I was excited to try it as soon as we got to the hotel. I can't wait to visit again on our next trip to Vegas and maybe sit at the pizza bar. It looks like it would be fun to watch them preparing the food. Definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes classic Italian meals!","Went here last night for a function and the function was fantastic, but boy does BM need to get it together. I work in the industry and now at the door they want your BM Industry card AND Gov't ID so they can put info in their computer about you. It was hot outside and it holds up the process. I guess now they are moving on to direct marketing or perhaps even selling it to other organizations. They, seriously, want your phone number, email and address! For half off of many $14. 00 drinks I guess that information is worth something to someone. . Walking in this place has this terrible smell of burnt pizza. . . all the time. I walk past this completely empty bar with two bartenders standing around and when I approach one bartender passes me off to another. I assure you a cranberry vodka takes two minutes to make. They have this weird habit of stapling this big piece of paper to my receipt and its quite irritating. Anyway, I proceeded to the function and needed another drink and they wanted to charge me $14 for a drink. I had show them my wrist band to get it half off and even then it was $8. I mean come on lady and BM. Half of $14 is not $8. . The last time I came I ordered a pizza and it was as if they had a promotional contract with Ritz Crackers. The pizza was about as dry as a Ritz and the toppings were hard to spot. A sprinkle of cheese here and basil leaf there- voila Margherita pizza. Needless to say I didn't bother with the food this time.","Great selection of beer, decent menu offering. I often have lunch here and wish I could enjoy one of the many varieties of beer available. I've eaten lunch here over 30 times and dinner here many times. The lunch specials are an ok deal at $6 for food, side and a drink. And the food is some of the best in the area (which says more about the food selection in the area than the quality of food here). The salads are huge with fries on top, the pizza is good with a slightly sweeter sauce, the hoagies are too big for one person at lunch, but still good. . The big downside here is the service. You might be the only table there at lunch and it will still take you over an hour to order, get ur food, eat, and pay. They don't have a real sense of urgency here, though it is a tad faster than Lucci's down the road. . For those rating this as a 5 star restaurant,  I urge you to eat somewhere other than a place with a drive up window. This is bar food at bar food prices. The beer selection is 4 stars, but in general because it's bar food and slow service I've got to give it a 3 star rating overall.","Visiting this restaurant for the first time during the summer was a treat. My wife and I sat outside in a cozy area where the waitresses and waiters could barely get through between the tables. The casual sidewalk and street traffic was enjoyable. They appear to have a policy where any waiter or waitress can help as we were serviced by three different people all very helpful and friendly. I rate the service a solid five stars. The selected Chianti glass of wine paired nicely with the sausage pizza we ordered (Saucisse italienne douce). The sausage was very fine and wasn't chunky as you might expect. Over all this was a wonderful experience that we repeated a second night while in town.","I would give this place a 5 for food and maybe a 2. 5-3 for dining experience. I have been here three times, and I think I might be done for awhile. . I know it is really popular, and I expect to wait 45-60 minutes to get a table after putting your name in. But, really, to then wait again in a line to order your food at the back counter? That second wait was about 15-20 people deep, all crowding everyone else eating at tables. When they bring you the yummy food, you are probably going to be crowded as well. When you want to pay. . . guess what? You get to wait in line at the front counter to do that. Three waits seems excessive even for a really good Cuban sandwich and the world's most amazing raspberry lime-aid.  (Aside note: I have a rule that I don't drink calories except for alcohol, but I break it for this stuff. Which is not to say I wouldn't put vodka in it if I could). Also, while I think Montreal is generally rather expensive, $15 (before tax and tip) for one sandwich and drink is excessive for a cafe. Add tax and tip, and you've got a $75-80 dollar lunch for four people. Four drinks, four sandwiches only.  (Second aside note: it is not helpful that I just ate at a fantastic Italian place in Munich two weeks before. . . cocktails, bottle of wine, basil lemonade for the kiddos, salad, two pizzas and two pastas for 80 Euros, so the comparison is not great. ). I accept the fact that perhaps I am old and the aforementioned is not a big deal to 20-somethings. I don't think I need to come back unless it were a really nice day, and I ordered take-out to eat at one of the picnic areas on the river, which would be a far preferable dining experience.  (And only one line involved. )","This review is simply for the take-out pizza experience -- and while, yes, that may seem ridiculous to give 5 stars --- it's ridiculous pizza! It's the kind of pizza that surprises you. You're not looking for much, maybe, as you pass by or running back to your sports betting table, or between dice rolls on the way back from the restroom. But that's the beauty of it. . . . My friends and I crave this pizza -- it's the first thing we all mention when talking about returning to Vegas (well, that and the craps tables at Bellagio). Whether at 2am after a long night of dancing, 11am while watching some sports betting next door, or 4pm after a long day at a pool party, the food is perfect. . Crust: Thin -- but not brittle. The crunchy/chewy balance is near perfect every time. They've got their science down. You won't have a soggy slice that drips all over you. It'll hold up without being too tough to bite into. . Toppings: All top quality. The italian cured pig varieties on the Gotham and spicy do not disappoint. The mushrooms on Forage are prime. The cheeses are rich. . Taste: Phenomenal. They don't over do it or try to make things too complicated. Even if you get the clam pizza, it's like PePe's -- basics but good. Like any good cooking. Quality ingredients well-done are the best. . Service: Always tends to be polite, efficient, and to the point. Heated-up slides taste great and only take 1-2 minutes to get right again. . Price: . . . . Five dollars and fifty cents. Very inexpensive. They're selling crap pizza all over Vegas with a Rolling Rock for $7.","So living in the Glendale area I have now given this Cheesecake Factory two chances. I'm a sucker for Cheesecake Factory. . I love eating at cheesecake factory I love their food I love their bread and especially the cheesecakes . But for some reason this location has now disappointed me twice. Total bummer bc well my fianc\u00e9 and our kids love coming here a. k. a. they love the bread lol! . So we first went to this location two weeks ago. . We were a huge party of 10 which was fine  you know it was dinner time no complaints on our waiter. . . . I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps or as they call them lettuce tacos. Nothing taco about only taco thing was it came out in the weird taco holder stand. . this is where I don't understand what happen I ordered chicken lettuce wraps I would expect there to be chicken in my lettuce wrap not one little sliver of chicken probably 1 inch long I want chicken I'm hungry! So already I'm disappointed. . We came back here the other night and our kids food(they get the kids pizza) was fine my fianc\u00e9's food was phenomenal(he usually gets the steak or salmon) and my food again not so great. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which I've ordered at other Cheesecake factory's and I've never had this issue that my chicken crusted Parmesan was soggy. Usually it's thin crispy not this one soggy like it was old and warmed up . . . . Crazy part is I know not to order those items again bc I know we will be back. . . Just I know for next time. . . Anyway I still love Cheesecake Factory. . . Just beware of soggy chicken lol","Arrived at 4:00 on a Friday, seated right away, but ended up sitting there for 3 hours. . Ordered appetizers and waited and waited, noticed people around us got their food before us and they had come in after us. Ordered two small thin crust pizzas and one thick, knowing it takes longer to cook asked for the thin ones right away, one came out, waitress didn't swing by for another 45 minutes, asked where the other thin crust was and she had ordered thick, so they comped it and made the thin one in 20 minutes, very expensive and not good, flavorless sauce, didn't even eat the awful crust, parking is a joke but honestly fired pie is way  better","We discovered Anthony's in Lauderdale years ago and every visit is delish. We order the same thing whether we are in NT, PA, FL. . . wings, salad extra gorgonzola,  pepperoni pizza. Fab fab fab. Our closest Anthony's is 4 hrs from home. . . Wish it was closer!!","Ok, I am adding this review as I wait on a box for my leftover \"average\" pizza. The gal went off to get it about 10 minutes ago and I can see her over talking to her male co workers. Pizza is average at beast and the help is undicciplined and obviously unmanaged. You may be thinking to yourself that they may be busy. . . . . Not a bit, 9 tables in the place have customers. What a bummer.","Waiting at the Pittsburgh airport &amp; was drawn to VIK because everything looked super fresh &amp; the gentleman behind the counter was hand tossing pizza dough in the air &amp; asking me at the same time what I would like to have! Well, after selecting the combo pizza(pepperoni, Italian sausage, bell peppers &amp; mushrooms, I scarfed it up. It was very fresh. Glad I picked Villa Italian Kitchen to grab something to eat, while at the Pittsburgh airport.","I recently spent a week in Las Vegas and my experience at The Otheroom was the highlight of my trip! I'll try my best to list why The Otheroom impressed me so much. . The Price: I purchased the $100 for $66 Groupon and it wen't faaaaar. I was able to order 4 small plates (which aren't very small), a burger, dessert, a beer, and a cocktail and I still wasn't at the $100! So I took two more drinks to go just to barely get to the $100. Previously I was paying $14 for a slice of pizza each night after a night of drinking or clubbing, so these prices were a huge suprise and well welcomed. Vegas needs more restaurants with affordable prices!. The Service: Daniel our mixologist/server/entertainer for the night totally made our experience. Not only could he make amazing drinks (ask about his smoked old fashion with home carved wood chips) but he did a great job of making sure we were always doing well and made great conversation when the time was called for. The chef was playing around with some new items for the next menu when we walked in and he offered us to taste it on the spot right when we walked in, we liked it so much that he said he'd offer the item to us at a discounted price that night if we wanted to order it. The assistant GM was also in the restaurant that night and did an awesome job making sure we were taken care of at all times. . The Quality: Any expectations we had were completely blown out the window. Each plate of food and glass of alcohol was delicious and perfect. Down by the pool $66 would of gotten me 1 Pina colada, a burger and some fries. There's no way anyone should pass up the offer The Otherroom is offering Las Vegas!. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll be eating all my meals and drinking all my drinks in The Otheroom!","Michele's (or Mickele's) Ristorante is a hidden gem attached to the Best Western hotel on the Mississauga/Etobicoke border a few blocks south of Renforth. We recently had dinner there and were pleasantly surprised.  . All of our meal was prepared in-house and was delicious. No Sysco heat and serve in this restaurant!  We ordered our choice of 3 antipasti for two for $15 and added a pizza margarita for $10. The thin crust pizza featured hand stretched dough and was cooked in their wood burning oven. It was a perfect light meal for us but would also be a great starter for a bigger meal. They also feature 5 antipasti for two for $19 and have an extensive Italian menu. Some items are individual and others are intended for sharing like pasta for two or caesar salad for two. There were several tables taking advantage of shared plates. . Prices were reasonable, especially considering the proximity to the airport which seems to raise the price of everything. The staff was friendly and our waiter offered up house-infused chile pepper oil for drizzling. It had a terrific kick!. They have a lunch menu, as well. We would happily go there again!. www. mickeles. ca  or  www. michelesristorante. com","Gourmet food this is not! I only come here because I'm a single mom and my son likes this place because of the small arcade. They had NO pepperoni pizza!! Pepperoni!! The most popular pizza there is!!  They didn't even have one in the oven, I had to special request it!  I decide while I'm waiting for pepperoni to also wait for bread sticks to get out of the oven. The manager comes over to take the empty bread stick tray and proceeds to grab the tongs by the wrong end! He puts out the new tray of bread sticks &amp; puts the same tongs out. I use the spatula from the pizza nearby. He tells me to use the tongs. I say \"No thanks, I just saw you touch the wrong end with your bare hands!\" I'm glad we've had all our shots! Built up immunity here we come!!","2012 Update: I've been here a few times since and never had any problems. . I had someone at NYPD contact me. This was regarding the bad pizza I had in my previous review. I thought that was really cool.","Pizza dough was raw. I called the restaurant, manager gave me the 3rd degree first telling me it should be gummy. Then telling me she would talk to the driver and baker, followed by her telling my to describe the dough and just giving me the third degree. The dough was raw, the top, the bottom, all the way through in the entire middle 5 inches of the pizza. It wasn't just gummy on the top layer, it was raw. I will not be ordering from here again as the manager offered no solution, was condescending and dismissive.","I visited this restaurant with my boyfriend today for the first time and we loved everything we had, we are definitely coming back again! The lady at the counter was very nice and also the guys at the back. We ordered the Regina pizza and it was the perfect size for two people (if you are planning to order more food), the crust crunchy and gooey at the same time and such quality ingredients and the wonderful part is that you can taste all of them but in a beautiful light way, I enjoyed every single bite. We also had the Gorgonzola salad which had a great combo of tangy, salty and sweet flavors, it paired perfectly with our pizza. And at the end of our meal we had to have their chocolate truffle with a hazelnut filling, very nice. To be honest, I enjoyed their food so much that I felt spoiled :)","You definitely get what you pay for here. This place doesn't survive on being the best pizza, best pasta, or salad bar. It is a quick, cheap, and easy meal if you your low on funds and have a hankering for pizza. . We eat here if we want something fast and simple. The salad has changed over the years. I remember it being premix and now it is more of a salad bar which we (my husband and I)like better. The pizzas are not bad, and the variety is pretty good. My favorites are always the macaroni pizza, and bbq pizza. It's not the best but it satisfy cravings for pizza. . This place is definitely family friendly. We always see families come in and the occasional small parties. The staff are always friendly and happy which can borderline on almost crazy ( that's not a bad thing but we have theories that the owner probably threatens them to smile lol). Tables are always cleared just in time as well.","This is a really solid place. My girlfriend, her family, and I came in on the grand opening day (12/20/16) excited to see if this place is better than Lou Malnati's in Central PHX. We were the 5th group to get in. Our waiter was new and did not have everything figured out yet, but we gave him the benefit of the doubt because the place just opened. We ordered quickly the cheese and BBQ stuffed pizzas. While waiting for our pizzas, we got two orders of the Parmesan fries which were decent. They play top hits music in the restaurant and it gives a fun vibe while waiting. The pizza took FOREVER to get out which was expected because deep dish is normally 35-45 mins to cook. However, this was probably about 50 mins. We finally got our pizzas and it was worth the wait! OMG! The cheese pizza was made to perfection. The tomato sauce is not too strong or overwhelming and the cheese they use has a really flavorful taste. The crust had a good flavor and it is not greasy at all. The BBQ pizza was good but I am not a huge BBQ pizza person. This place IS better than Lou Malnati's, in my opinion, because it is stuffed pizza and not just deep dish. It doesn't feel like you're eating a bunch of fried bread like a normal deep dish. I definitely want to come back and get some more cheese pizza. I think this place is going to do really well here.","As someone who loves pizza and loves to try all the pizza places in Arizona. This pizza was good, thin, light and airy but still had a Decent amount of sauce. I had a margarita pizza and added pepperoni, as well as the pizza with jalape\u00f1os and sausage. The pizzas were good, I highly suggest the one with jalape\u00f1os and sausage. I cannot remember the name but do  remember the taste. I gave four out of five stars, due to them not taking orders over the phone or delivery.","6/15/10. Friend and I ordered take-out: an Arugula salmon couscous salad and a small Four cheese (mozz, romano, fontinella, and feta). I believe I also requested ricotta on it. The salad was excellent, although I wished all of the ingredients used were listed on the menu- I had to fish out a couple of troublesome items. The pizza was fantastic!  And this was after we let it sit for awhile.  (I love my thin-crust pizzas hot, very crispy and fresh-- not cold nor stale, and if it's the least bit soggy, I am heartbroken. )  But Nello's was definitely a hit tonight!  I kicked myself for waiting all this time to go back for another taste. I'll be returning VERY soon!. Music accompaniment: Dionne Warwick: The Definitive Collection.","The 8 corner is awesome!  We order sheet pizza from here before and it is not your typical sheet pizza. It's really good!! Can't review on delivery speed, I always pick it up because we don't live in the delivery area. Wings and cheesy bread are good also. I do like Marco's wings better though. Definately one of the best pizza delivery places around.","This is our second time here(visiting from NYC).  Amazing variety of pizza! Something for everyone. Excellent crispy crust and intricate topping combinations. The mushroom pizza with truffle is a favorite of ours. You just try the one with prosciutto. Fun place, great service!! Must try when in the area.","Being from Chicago I am extremely picky when it comes to pizza and hands down Novanta is the best local pizza place in the surrounding Madison area. Great service every time, always delicious, and never disappointed. If you haven't been here I highly recommend going and indulge in the graham cracker cake too because it's fantastic!","Destihl has a HUGE menu. This is a great place to go if you want options. They've got burgers, sandwiches, salads, seafood, pizza, a bunch of appetizers and more. They also have a gluten free menu which is pretty rare in Champaign. They have a gluten free crust for pizzas, but it is baked in the same oven as the regular pizzas. They also have a great brunch menu on weekends. . I've come here a bunch of times and overall I've been really happy with my experiences. I've had two bad experiences though. Once I got some entree that was pretty worthless and one time I had a waiter that continually messed up our orders throughout the course of dinner. Besides those two occasions, the food and service have both been great. . Food recommendations:. Appetizers - Ancho Chips &amp; Dip. Bacon &amp; Brussels. Chorizo Stuffed Dates. Salads - Ancho Chicken Salad. Thai Steak Salad. Entrees - Dijon Chicken. Cedar Plank Salmon (If you're in the mood for something light and simple). Gaucho Skirt Steak (The best option on the menu!). Drinks - The Bloody Mary is pretty delicious. I almost always get the gaucho skirt steak. I've never been disappointed with it! . Again, if you want a place with lots of options and good food, definitely check out Destihl!","Absolute garbage. Picked up a phone in take out order - got home and it was literally disgusting. I called in to let them know we found plastic in the rice and the meat wasn't cooked - the lady's reply: \"yeah, so. . . What you want?!\". I hung up, thew the food out and ordered a pizza. . . Health inspectors should pay this place a visit.","We had dinner here after shopping at the antique mall. Ravioli with creamy pesto, yummy. Pepperoni pizza rolls, also yummy. Tuscan steak sandwich, pizza, all delicious. The crust was so Italian, according to hubby who ate lots of pizza in Naples. Our server was very attentive, Kelsey, kept on top of everything. Wish we lived closer, would be here once w week.","We were staying at the Aria when we came here one night. Service was good. It was a little slow but then again- when I go out to eat I'm not in a hurry. I want good food and to enjoy the company of the person I'm with. . We got the gotham pizza which was good, and the Mozzarella Bar with 3 items and let our server pick. It came with prosciutto, a hard sliced cheese (I forget the name) and Burrata. On the plate was also mustard, thin bread (naan like), olives and pickled veg. This was phenomenal! I loved it. That plate alone was well worth the money.","Was hesitant between two and one star but left it at two as waitress was quite accommodative. Was visiting Toronto for professional event, wanted to do lunch. Seemed like this place was the only game in town for a dairy restaurant, not pizza. The place is drab. The decor is very questionable with extra cords from the lights been rolled and exposed everywhere. They only had one waitress-hostess-barista-bartender when we came. Everything was, understandably pretty slow. We sat near the window and booth was vibrating so had to change the table. My plates and utensils were dirty, like literally oily all over. The last straw was the olive tapenade. We got our butter-olive oil-tapenade for the bread and something was pretty smelly. When I tried the tapenade I figure out what it was they left it outside without the fridge and it got sour. We stood up and left and agent to a place next door. This place is  sad. . . it either needs to close or change the owners.","Have ordered from here quite often. Magura pizza is our favorite as well as the tuna melt. My kids always ask for the melts!  Also really love the fried mushrooms and zucchini. If not sure, suggest getting the appetizers with all the items to try out. Highly recommend you giving this place a try.","Good food and a cute space. Big patio with live music on Fridays. Tried the bruscetta, jalape\u00f1o poppers, and pizza. We'll be going back.","The Maple Leaf lounge in Toronto's domestic terminal is similar to other Maple Leaf lounges in the country but this one is a lot bigger. There were actually two bar areas with your usual choices of liquor, beer on tap, wine and  a variety of juices, sodas, coffees and teas. As far as food goes, there was the usual fare of cookies, pretzels, 2 types of soup, potato salad, edamame pods, chips, salsa and dip, margarita pizza and a kale salad. Overall a comfortable lounge to chill and relax in and possibly spot a quasi-celebrity. My husband spotted Dragon's Den's Michael Wekerle sipping on some wine while yakking on the phone. The only minor complaint I had was that there are no charging stations at the lounge chairs but there are charging stations in other spots in the lounge as well as free wifi and a selection of magazines to choose from. Although it's busy in there, it's a much more relaxing and comfortable place to wait for a flight than in the busy terminal gates.","This place came recommended by a close friend and let me say, it did NOT disappoint!!! I had FOUR slices, I just couldn't stop eating it. I finally had to walk away or I would still be eating. We ordered 2 large pizzas and a chicken salad and the 5 of us were in awe of how good it all was. We will definitely be ordering here from now on, so nice to have a really good pizza place to order from. I can't wait to try more items on the menu!","Super convenient - on top of a subway and at the foot of the apartment complex. . The fruit isn't very fresh and is definitely overpriced; their meat is especially overpriced as well. I've been there at the very end of closing time, and I get the feeling that a lot of the foods that are pre-made sit in the display boxes or in the shelves until they're sold - who knows how long that is. . I'm a big fan of their daily dinner specials on the weekdays - they have take and bake pizza on Thursdays, and rotisserie chicken on Wednesdays, or something like that, for $7. 99 which is quite a deal. . Convienient when I need something quick, but I would definitely not rely on Longos as my main source of groceries.","The food was mediocre at best. Had the ultimate pizza. Should have been cooked longer. Based on the pictures i saw on yelp, i was already worried that it wouldn't be cooked long enough and sure enough it wasn't. Also had the Vegas fries. They were different in a good way but it was just smothered with too much of the sauce. That's saying something because i always want more sauce on everything. Lastly, we ordered a couple corn dogs. Those were actually the best part of the meal. The batter was slightly sweeter than most and it really made them taste great. $31 spent and the only thing we were truly happy with were the processed corn dogs. We'll definitely be spending our money elsewhere next time.","My job used to require me to travel all over the USA. I have eaten the \"Best Pizza in Town\" from Maine to San Diego - many times over. I grew up in NYC. I know pizza. . Bruno's pizza . . . probably the BEST PIZZA I have ever experienced in MY LIFE. [Also, the owners are a true class act - they will treat you RIGHT. Period. ]","Lemme preface this by saying I'd give the overall experience a 3. 75. Not quite a 4, but definintely higher than a 3. .  . Six of us went to the 7:00 LOVE show at the Mirage (AWESOME!). Then we headed over to Mandalay. We were fiending for something to eat and nothing we came across sounded right. Then finally it hit me. Italian. That's what I needed. So we found our way to Lupo (by Wolfgang Puck), conveniently located directly across from the Red Square, which was another place we planned to stop by during our trip. We didn't have a reservation (Friday night @ ~10:00) but were promptly seated. It wasn't all that busy anyway. . After ordering our drinks and meals we were served a couple baskets of bread with duos of tapenade in olive oil and a white bean dip. Very nice start to the meal. The tapenade was delicate and salty; the bean dip smooth and creamy; the bread was pleasantly chewy with a nice crust. The drinks finally came. I had ordered a passion fruit cosmo. Hit the spot. . Next came the salads and appetizer. I ordered Prosciutto San Daniele for us, and the rest of the table got Caesars. Smiling faces all around. The caesar had a nice little twist no one had experienced before. Pine nuts. It gave just the right amount of nuttiness to the palette. . Then came dinner. Half the table ordered Penne alla Carbonara, my friend ordered Scialatielli con Salcisse alla Bolognese, my man ordered the Lasagna Verde, and I was feeling the Funghi Pizza. I didn't try the Penne, although they all thought it was great. I did try the lasagna and loved that. I also had the Bolognese and really liked the sauce. My pizza was good, but was more doughy than I'd expected. I was hoping for more of a Neopolitan style. And it was enough for at least 2 people. I only ended up eating 2 pieces out of 6. . Finally, for dessert I HAD to try the Tiramisu. It's my absolute favorite and I get it at every Italian restaurant that offers. Uh-muh-guh. I think this is my new #1. It was creamy, dreamy, melt-in-your-mouth, with just enough espresso and liquor that's not overpowering. Die. . Bottom line: we enjoyed the food. The only thing that was kinda lacking was the inconsistent service. When the waitress was around she was very attentive and lovely. But when she was gone, she was no where to be seen. We may go back next time we're in the area (that Tiramisu is caling my name!), but there are so many other restaurants in Vegas to try it may not be for a while.","Eat here all the time. Pizza is great, service is great. Sometimes you have to wait a little bit but I don't mind cause we love the pizza. We would recommend to anyone.","I would give this parti Cici's a -10 if it were possible. I ordered a specialty personal pan pizza which first of all took over 40 minutes for them to get it out to me. Not to mention, they were not crowded. When it got to me, the pizza dough was still raw, and it was not what I had ordered. The pizza bar was very empty. I am a Cici's pizza professional. I have been eating at Cici's for over 20 years. My kids have had several birthday parties at Cici's. I lived in Virginia for many years, where the Cici's are much different and much better. I will never ever go to another Cici's Pizza in Las Vegas. This is not my first horrible experience with this particular restaurant. The management didn't seem to have a care in the world when I brought these problems to their attention.","I'm a little torn here. I wasn't too happy with the Pizza Hut portion of this place, but I was happy with the Taco Bell portion. . Let me explain. The Hubster and I were feeling gross on a Saturday afternoon. What better way to deal with this than by putting garbage into our stomachs? We decided that since it's been years since we had Pizza Hut, we'd go for it. We came down and ordered two pizzas on hand-tossed crusts. It was a deal, so why not?. While we were waiting, we got a two chicken soft taco combo in the Taco Bell/KFC takeout area. I know. We're disgusting. For some reason, the combo was a full $2 less than advertised, but the bill was completely correct. No complaints here. Fries were just as I remembered them, and so were the tacos (which they easily made dairy-free for me). It's not the best food, but it's Taco Bell. You know what to expect. Drinks were refillable. . We finally got our pizzas and brought them home. The hand-tossed dough was incredibly disappointing. We should have gone with the regular crust, which I recall being almost deep-fried. The crust was also super sweet for some reason. The pizza wasn't even better the next day. We lamented our decision. . Service at both the Pizza Hut dining room and the Taco Bell/KFC fast food spot were very friendly and accommodating. I'm genuinely concerned that I may have reawakened my love of Taco Bell, despite being able to fight it off for so many years. . Don't know if I'll be back, but one rarely actually plans to be incredibly hungover. . Oh, and Pizza Hut still has a dinner buffet. I mean, holy crap!","We went using a Groupon, and the value with the Groupon was fantastic. We would say a bit on the pricey side without it. We went for the Sunday brunch buffet and it was definitely a quality buffet with everything made to order and super fresh. . Lots of fresh cold cuts, pastas made to order, delicious polenta fries, pizzas and omelettes made to order, fabulous waffles, cakes, fruit and other desserts and mimosas!!. Some downsides would be that the buffet spreads out over three floors so if stairs arent your thing, you better hope someone with you doesnt mind getting your food for you. Im not sure if there was an elevator, and of course the restaurant is only a buffet for part of the day on Sundays, so any other time this wouldnt be an issue!!. On a positive note, all of those stairs burns calories between courses!!. We would go back!!::))","So clean!  Great service!  The food is spot on Every Time!  Favorite is the beef tartare which seems totally scary because it's raw meat and a raw quill egg but it's freaking amazing unreal and I also like that Bianca flatbread and the Allegra flatbread the Allegra sounds totally weird like refried black beans shrimp who would think to put that all together on a pizza but it's on unbelievable you got to go in there you got to see it it's so fun it's so yummy it's so unique and it's so awesome and Chef Sonia is amazing!!!!","I lived off of Gus's pizza in the dorms. The pizza is good &amp; incredibly cheap and the wings are some of the best I've had at pizza joints. An 18\" pizza with two toppings and two drinks costs less than $10 and delivery is free and 24 hours. Best of all the delivery boys are always, without fail, completely high and usually ask if they can call you after their shift. Food &amp; entertainment, every time!","With everyone talking about the Peking Duck pizza, I had to give it a shot. We got both the peking duck pizza (which is this location's exclusive specialty item) and the Smoked Prosciutto pizza. I thought that the peking duck pizza would just be a neat novelty but it was a delicious combination of sweet, savoury, and deliciously crispy duck skin! It definately feels like I am eating the traditional dish with a nice twist to it!. The Smoked Prosciutto pizza was also very good. The sweet date sauce added another dimension to the smokey and salty prosciutto. It was a great treat. . To add a cherry on top of the incredible meal thus far, they gave us two complimentary Panna Cotta. Which was delicious in my opinion because I love cinnamon. Overall this was a nice experience of causal italian dining with a specialty item to die for!","We visited Cenci's this past weekend and it was your typical Pittsburgh pizza joint. . . . . . . . .  full of yinzers enjoying mediocre food. Everyone was nice and the service was good and their traditional crust was delicious. However, that where it ended. . . . .  very skimpy toppings and flavorless cheese. If you're looking for mediocre food with nice people, this is your kind of place. If not, move on.","I ordered the white pizza and it was really yummy. Baked perfectly and seasoned well! We also tried the caramel and bavarian cream churro. The cream one was definitely better then the caramel. The fried  zucchini and mushroom was good but way too greasy. Grease literally oozed out when we stuck a fork in them. The wings were pretty greasy too. 5 stars on the pizza but 3 stars on the appetizers. Oh, staff was really nice too :-)","Great, great, great pizza. I had the traditional tomato, basil, red sauce &amp; I added goat cheese. Only got 4 stars because the service was a little lacking (the tables around us received way more attention. ) but the food was delicious!!","Last minute pizza for the kids inside the casino. No wait and quick. We ordered a full pizza and fries. Must say that kids asking to come back.","If I could give zero stars I would, food is not good. Wife orders a nexican pizza and ground meat was undercooked, so she asked for a cheese quesadilla and they gave her one with white cheese and cold bell peppers and tomatoes in it, tortilla wasn't even grilled. I had their famous stuffed chili relleno. Hamburger meat inside it was a soggy mess. Sorry No Bueno","I ordered the Crisp Cobb Salad. I like that they make the salad in front of you and toss the dressing. My boyfriend got the Chicken Caesar Salad, both salads were equally amazing!  I'm sure Crisp will become one of my regular stops during the week. I want to try their wraps, sandwiches, and pizza's as well.","Our first time here - ordered take out and everyone enjoyed it, even the kids! We ordered 2 pizzas - meat lovers and cheese and papajoun wrap. Very generous with the toppings and loads of cheese! The dough itself is perfect as it's not too heavy with too much bread. The wrap was amazing as well with enough stuffing. Will definitely come back to try the other dishes and different types of pizzas.","The three cheese pizza with black olives and onions from Ohio City Pizza is my favorite Cleveland pizza. Even better if you add bacon to the order. . I recommend ordering for pick up for two reasons. . 1. you get to talk to Birdie who is often the one making you pizza. Even though another reviewer referred to her as a pirate, I have always found her to be friendly and fun. . 2. sometimes they overcook pizzas but that doesn't seem to happen when you pick it up on time.","This theatre is the one I go to time and time again. . The woman in me loves to shop but the child in me loves the arcade here. I have spent way too much money on their skeeball and ddr machines here. I have no clue if this information is important to anyone. . . But this is the only theatre I know of that has a ddr machine that functions properly and doesn't have sticky pads in yyc. . I love being able to catch the newest movies so close to home. The ability to reserve seats for AVX is awesome as well. Gives me more time to shop and play. The food selection is average. I do love their pizza though when it's fresh out of the oven :) The cleanliness of the theatres are hit or miss; we've often had to sit in seats with sticky floors. . Overall, this is one of my favourite theatres in yyc. Love the discounted tickets on Tuesdays and the scene card program. Will be back to catch another new release in the near future.","I love this place. The food is outstanding. Delicious pizza, pastas, and sandwiches, with a spicy kick! The garlic cheese bread is huge, much like the rest of their portions. You will be taking some home, to be sure. They are incredibly busy during peak hours and the wait times can be long. We like to go for lunch, rather than dinner, to ensure we get a table fast. Friendly vibes from the staff are palpable.","I chuckled when I saw that this place is categorized on Yelp under \"Gastropubs. \" That's pretty generous. . I went to GameWorks for a big group dinnertime outing. We didn't get any special rates, just their Dine &amp; Play combo that's always available. For $14. 99, you get one of their time cards loaded for one hour, and one of ten specially labeled items on the menu. It's also possible to do $21. 99 for a two-hour card, but nobody chose that option. . Like some of the others, I went with the Fish &amp; Chips because it's normally $14. 50, which is almost the price of the Dine &amp; Play one-hour deal. I wasn't expecting much, but the cod fillets were reasonably flavorful. It's unfortunate that they seemed a little heavy rather than fluffy, and the batter wasn't as crispy as I'd hoped. I chose waffle fries for the side rather than mashed potatoes or salad, neither of which can really be called chips. The fries were decently seasoned and generally had a decent crisp and some fluffiness, but I've had better. . I also sampled the GameWorks Nachos (normally $12) with steak (+$3). I suppose that the meat could be construed as \"ground steak\" instead of ground beef. Nothing in the dish was anything special. I even prefer the TGI Friday's nachos over this. . I should note that they handled service for our rather massive table (20+ people) just fine, with constant replacement of water pitchers too, although condiments (notably ketchup for my fries) were a bit delayed. . As for the arcade, I only partook in one round of DDR Supernova 2 because I'd handed off my card to a friend while playing pool ($13/hr Sun-Thu 4pm-close, but I think they weren't too strict on the one hour). The pool tables and cues seemed decent enough, although someone noted that one of the rails seemed to be a bit dead. Anyway, from what I saw my friends play, the arcade had a nice selection of shooting games, air hockey, a crazy souped up Pac-Man inspired version of air hockey, some rhythm games, and some racing games. I've seen worse arcades for sure. . I should note that all the TVs were set to the Monday Night football game, with audio available seemingly everywhere in the building. This was fun for casual fans and for vocal Cowboys fans alike. They also have a football game-day food promo that I believe was $35 for a large (16\") one-topping pizza, 35 wings, a pitcher of soda (or +$5 for a pitcher of beer), and one-hour game cards at $5 per person. I also noticed that they offer $10 unlimited gaming on Thursdays 5pm-close and immediately wished that the social had taken place then. Oh well. . I don't foresee myself coming back very soon, but GameWorks has some potential appeal for arcade gaming. Just don't expect too much from the food and you'll be fine.","We went to Glendale Glitters on a Tuesday night and didn't run into any of the problems others did with vendors and huge crowds. We grabbed a pizza at the pizza place right there, then walked around looking at the lights. It was a very nice, mellow evening - not the mess others have run into. Great family activity.","Ah Downtown Vegas, my home away from home. . Let's get right down to it, the Plaza is not for everyone expecting the Wynn. But if you're expecting a pretty great hotel room, and a backyard styled pool with ample good eats and the center of Fremont, then this is your place. . Check in: . The check in line was indeed long, but the staff was really pleasant. Upon finding out we were there for our anniversary, the check in personnel (Johnathan, I believe) was kind enough to upgrade us to a suite! . It was oddly shaped, and the bathroom was up to a La Quinta/Holiday Inn Standard. The room itself was quite nice! We faced Fremont street with an EXCELLENT view. Only thing was that I should have taken advantage of the free earplugs. . There was a fun balcony, and mini fridge which came in handy. Great! . The Pool is the reason for the less than stellar stars. The pool looks like your community pool, and was closed for a day while we were there. There was an awful sewer smell that permeated until it got resolved. I read outside, but decided not to get in the pool, opting for relaxing in my cool room instead. . The food inside the Plaza is GREAT. . Hash House for dinner is a must, as it has good portions great waitstaff and good pours. . The pizza place is a bit meh, but reasonable. . Same thing for the coffee place. . Check out took time, but was simple. . I'd definitely stay again.","Have no problem with the pizza, or the service. The owner is a major turn off. He planted his large self at our table and proceeded to wax on about himself for most. of the meal, his real estate deals, his money, blah blah. Never once asked any. thing about us, or, even how the food was. Guy is a loser.","We went to the recently opened new location, which didn't have the sandwiches but I guess had more pastas? We had the rush street (pepperoni) pizza and the one with sausage for appetizers. I had the lobster ravioli which was really good. Everyone else enjoyed their food, all got a variety of dishes. . The downside was it was newly opened, they didn't get our reservation call from this location (we went to this location and they called the new location for us and put us on the list and the hostess was not at all nice about this) and so we waited *forever* (a good 45min) in a packed place that had no sitting area (the bar of course was full). Also we sat between the kitchen and the waitstaff area so I got to listen to the complaints and drama of the waitstaff. I get places are new, but try to *look* professional even if you can't do your job.","I've had the pleasure of having almost everything on the Dragon Fire menu, and I have to say I'm very impressed. I like spicy food and I was pleased with their self-named \"Dragon Fire\". Spicy isn't the only thing they do though. The Red Dragon is probably my second favorite. . I'm not a vegetarian, but I was impressed with the large number of vegetarian pizza choices they have. And for the non-vegetarians out there, with most of them you don't even know you're eating something without meat. . Probably the best aspect of their pizzas is the dough. It's very chewy, but not undercooked. It kind of reminded me of a warm flat-bread (like the kind you would use for a gyro) but thinner and warm. It folds easily so it's not droopy. . Probably the best advice I can give would be for you to bookmark the \"Finder\" page on their website. They keep a current calendar and Twitter feed on there so you'll always know where they are.","Dined here in a small group party, I personally had a Fontina Burger and Date Shake. Surrounded by an urban farm with indoor and outdoor seating, everything certainly tasted fresh. The burger was tasty and excellently grilled, the fries well-seasoned and neither dry nor mushy; the shake was smooth and remained nicely chilled. The pizza had crispy thin crust and was delicious, not like big-name inner city joints with dripping grease, and the onion rings were crisp and fresh. Great prices for portions too.","Glad we made it here! Ambiance was very comfortable and relaxing, even with a full restaurant. We started with the cauliflower appetizer, the crispy capers made the dish! They brought out a warm loaf of chewy rustic fresh bread which we really enjoyed as was waited for our meals. Lobster Nero, bacon pizza with quail eggs, spaghetti with meatballs and one other dish was had. . . all very, very good!!! We swooned over the pizza crust, with it's perfect texture and flavor. Service was engaging and professional and the experience was complete. If you're in town on vacation, skip the strip and get here.","The service on entry didn't seem too friendly and almost cold but it was something that really didn't phase me. I walked upto the front placed my order and waited for what seemed quick for a large pizza. Got a discount from the cashier who was very pleasant. Bit into it and had literally had an hallelujah moment, of what was possibly the best za I've ever had in this city. Definitely will go there again and try the calzos! Thanks Fresca","We popped in right before closing - I know, we were \"those guys\" - but the staff were still welcoming and helpful! . We shared a large Don as well as a large house salad among three people. This was an almost perfect portion, we had a few bites left of the salad remaining. . The Don was pretty solid! Good meat to cheese ratio given that all of Grimaldi's pizzas are thin crust. The bottom was just a tad too burnt for my taste. However, the house salad had far too much dressing. I know that personally I usually lean towards light dressing, but even the guys agreed that the greens should not be literally dripping! Not terrible for a sit down, quick bite, but definitely recommend being careful with the salad.","Pretty cool neighborhood bar that's a lot more than just a bar. I mean, at dinnertime on Friday night there were families eating here with lots of kids. That's kind of weird to me. First, I wouldn't think it would be appropriate to take young kids to a bar. Second, I don't really want to be around kids when I go to a bar. But everyone seemed to be perfectly happy with it, so that makes me the odd man out.  . We had burgers, and they were pretty good. The menu had all the usual pub grub, and they also make pizzas. Many people were eating them, but we didn't try it, so, shrug. We also had cheese curds. They were, well, cheese curds. . . (I'm sorry, I'm not a huge fan, so I can't tell the quality).  . One weird thing was that you had to go up to the side of the bar to place your order. This made it confusing how to leave a tip. On the table, or with the person you placed the order with?  . Overall, we enjoyed it here, but we probably wouldn't come back during dinner hour, as the atmosphere was a bit weird for us.","4 stars, for fast food pizza. Not even registered on the ny pizza scale.","The tuna pizza was, as one of my daughters said, \"One of the best things I've tasted in my life!\"  My other daughter said \"I'd come back every day for the tuna pizza!\"","Maybe the best pizza in town next to Hawthornes. Yes it's greasy but that's why I like it. Great pizza and wings. Good beer specials.","Enjoyed lunch here today! I got a margharita pizza and my friend got a silicce sandwich and we both enjoyed our food immensely. The wait staff was very nice and fast too. Would eat here again!","OK. So, I'm looking at all of these 4 and 5 star ratings of this place and I've come to the conclusion that there is truly no accounting for taste. Yes, it is a neighborhood bar, cute, quaint. If you want that sort of ambiance, that's fine. The pizza and hoagies are OK, just that - OK. I've had better, I've had worse. Try it and decide for yourself. If you want to justify your \"taste test, \" there is a coupon in the Enjoy Book, as someone else pointed out.","Ordered a lunch special.  2 slices and a soda. . Took 20 minutes to receive the absolute worst pizza I've ever had. The cheese was either fake or really old and the sauce was really watery. The place looked really nice but the food was terrible and took a really long time. . Save your time and money and go somewhere else. . Yuck.","Loud, one has to SCREAM to converse, I can't understand the need for loud, pounding music. Perhaps it's because there's a very busy bar on the premises, that's why. There was a group of us that evening, and it was decided there'd be a bottle of wine for the 5 who wanted wine wirh their pizza. I ordered a vegetarian as did several others, meanwhile we were served complimentary tomato pat\u00e9 &amp; bread, which was gobbled down quickly by all; we were famished and it was getting late. My veggie pizza was good, piping hot, thin crust. Others who ordered the same liked theirs, as well as those who had whatever variety they'd ordered. Pizzas are only $10. 00 per, for ANY variety from 10PM btw, overall my pizza &amp; 1 glass of wine w/tip was $25. 00, a bit  too steep, but next time I'll just forego the wine tyvm. Service was good and attentive, ambiance LOUD. If you want to watch your spending, wait till 10 PM and forget the wine.","We went in on a Thursday evening around 7pm. . .  only a few tables taken but alot of activity with take out. The place is very comfortable and welcoming and the reno job is great. . the service was great. We specifically went to sample the pizza and have a couple of beers. The flavors were tasty. . . tried the Margherita (had to!!) and one of the specials of the day. . .  very good and better that its just a short walk away. Would like to see a couple of more items on the menu. . . . .","I guess it's four stars if you consider what neighbourhood you're in? I'm not sure. It was very standard food, standard service and I'd even venture to say less than standard ambience. . . . so I'm a bit dumbfounded by the reviews. . Food:  grilled calamari appetizer and caprese salad. Serving sizes were correct. The sauce on both was identical. A bit strange. Under salted/seasoned as well. Mains were linguini with shrimp, and pizza w proscutto and arugala. Points for offering parmesan cheese. The mains were very average, no complexity of flavours, the pasta (like, the actual linguini) had the same flavours as something I'd make out of a box at home. When the server opened our bottle of wine, she filled both our glasses to the top right off the bat--no swirling, no sniffing. Just here ya go. . If your'e going with your family, and you live in the neighbourhood, I guess this is a good option. Since I don't have a family, and I live far away - I won't be going back.","Love love love the Staten Island Pizza! Prosciutto. . . mozzarella. . . pesto cream sauce over the best pizza dough in the area. Look on the back of the menu. . . best custom pizza on the area. Enjoy!!","Their pizzas and appetizers are good. I think the crust could use a little improvement - it has a bit of a cardboard taste and texture, not awful but not that great either. I do like their sauce which is a tiny dab sweet but not too much. Items ordered were well prepared and carefully packaged. . Delivery takes about an hour during peak times but that is typical in this neighborhood. Person on the phone and the delivery person were courteous.","Had a coupon for a free pound of wings (10 wings) when you buy a lg. 1-topping pizza. . . me and my buddy used the coupon and got a pepperoni pizza and hot buffalo wings, had a large beer a piece, split the bill in half; seriously the best $15 I've spent in a while. Probably my new favorite pizza here in Phoenix, and hands down the best wings I've ever had. Housemade Ranch was delectable. Our server and hosts were so helpful and polite. Definitely will be out in my regular cycle; want ro try so much here!","Great little place for excellent brick oven pizza! Good atmosphere good wine list good prices!!!","I came here for breakfast on a weekend. We arrived when they opened. It was a brisk morning, but it was still nice to have the cool breeze blowing through. . . until the cook went outside to smoke right in front of the window. Inhaling cig smoke was a huge turnoff and really irritated us. . The tea selection is modest but I was beyond thrilled to find decaf English Breakfast. For my meal I ordered the spanikopita crepe. I was going to go for an omelet, but thought I should try something different that I can't get just anywhere. The crepe was filled with spinach, onion, and feta cheese. It had an amazing flavor, but the crepe was rather rubbery. I actually felt like I was eating pizza rather than a crepe.  . My friend got an omelet that she really enjoyed and she also got the Nutella dessert crepe. Again, her crepe was very tough and rubbery and there was only a small smear of Nutella on it. . I think if they tweak their recipe for crepe batter it could have far more potential to be an amazing food option. The omelet choices are pretty great. That's what I'll stick to, should I return.","Wonderful food, best pizza in town. Louie and Marie make you feel very welcome. The staff are friendly, fun and effiecient .","3. 5 stars. This place is in a great location with patio seating so you can people watch while you eat and drink. We sat on the patio since it was a nice warm Feb. evening. . Our waiter was busy but friendly and helpful. Not overly attentive and I did have to work to get his attention at one point, but he was busy. In general it was good service. . The food was good to great. The pasta bolognase was hearty and had great flavors with the fresh basil accenting the meat. The shrimp in the scampi were cooked perfectly and my friend said it was a textbook execution with the garlic not overpowering everything else. My pizza was good, for brick oven pizza it really should had had better bottom crust, but the flavor was good. . So two great dishes and one just good. Bear with me though, I am a NY pizza snob and in college used to cook in a family Italian restaurant.  . This was not stellar food but, except for pizza, was pretty solid. I have had a lot worse at more expensive places in Vegas (trevi, ugh). . Beer selections were pretty good too.","Laughable that anyone would rate this place 5 stars. In the Chicagoland area Rosati's is right up there with pizza hut, but they have the audacity to be twice the price. A pizza from Rosati's is only edible after 12-15 blue moons. I don't want to know what you people rated papa johns. . .","We ordered delivery from here when we lived in the Silverado Ranch area. . It is decent, and it does remind me of some of the pizzas I ate when I lived in New Jersey. But there are better options in the area. Enzo's, Metro, etc.  . I personally found the pizza to have really heavy toppings, especially in the meat department. If you love meat lovers pizza (mine was more of a supreme pizza), and an insane amount of toppings, this might be your favorite joint. I personally wanted more vegetables, as I felt as if they skimped on them. I normally don't like to eat a lot of meat on pizza, but if I do I would like the ratio of vegetables to meat to at least be even somewhat. . Again, this is a good option if you are an insane meat pizza eater but for me it was just okay.","My wife and I stopped by this place for lunch. We ordered the sampler and it was very good. However the loaded frittata was awesome. I could eat more of those than I should. We both ordered salads and I had the Italiano. It was delicious and my wife loved her chopped salad as well. A few things to note here. No doubt the food was good and the deep dish pizza looks amazing. We will be back for sure for that. But the service was outstanding, my ice tea was never empty and added ice without even asking (no ice in ice tea = disappointment for me). Our waitress was all over it. Always attentive but not too much. Lots of little details in the service like explaining wait times on deep dish, asking if we needed extra dressing for our salads etc. The manager stopped by to ask if everything was to out liking, you could see servers taking care of other tables that were not there. Overall outstanding service. The decor was very nice for a pizza place. I did visit the bathroom as well and it was nice and clean but the sink was so cool. Never seen a faucet that dispenses water then you move your hands out to the edges and it dries them. Loved it. Check this place out. Good food, great service and nice atmosphere. We will be back.","Still the number one spot we go when craving our pizza and wings!  Their chicken sandwich is amazing too. I only give it 4 out of 5 stars because I'm picky when it comes to my wings. I love my wings crispy and that's always a  50/50 when we get them. Otherwise, I always send people this way when they are craving a good homemade pizza.","The pizza tastes like something you microwave. The combo comes with a small cup. If other pizza places are open id avoid this one.","Tasty latte, comfy chairs, mellow tunes, warm sunshine. . . this is life. I haven't been here since last fall but am glad I stepped into the new location yesterday afternoon - the transformation was a pleasant surprise!. The old location still serves as Br\u00fbloir's 'laboratory' where mad coffee scientist and owner Vincent continues to experiment and roasts a vast variety of beans and tests different blends to cater to its clientele varying palates. The difference is he now has more space to service his machines, store more freshly sourced beans and most importantly more room expand his imagination to craft and concoct the perfect roasting formulas. . I've been told that the reason he got into the process of roasting his own coffee grains was to gain control over the outcome. Interestingly enough, the secret to torrefying coffee beans is part science and part art as you are working beans that contain thousands of chemicals and when you apply heat to it, quickly cool it, many things can happen. Acidity, sweetness, mouthfeel, flavor are all important factors that goes into the final result. . The Torrefication process is very conditional, even if you have best ingredients you'll never really end up exact same results but there's one thing you can be sure of is you'll always end up with a fresh batch of roasted beans (vs pre-packaged). . So what are the final results? None conclusive so far as there are still so many to try but I must admit that trying different brews in a welcoming and naturally bright sunny space makes it so much more enjoyable. If I were to pick on something, I'd say that the foam art is terrible, but who cares right?. Oh forgot to mention that the menu includes bagels, breakfast sandwiches, scrabbled eggs with feta &amp; bacon, grilled cheeses, pizza, soups and local sweets to satisfy your hunger. . Can't wait to come back and savor the next drink, and test some more grilled cheese on 'to the be built' outdoor terrasse!","Rocco's pizza is really good. One time I was there though and the cheese slid off my pizza and burned my leg. So be careful.","One bite and I was transported back to the crowded streets of Monterrey. I could almost smell the exhaust of the vochos and hear the distant conversation of the local policia extorting their prescribed mordida. Quite simply, this is the taco as the way it was intended by its creators. The pure and unadulterated classic enjoyed by the Mexican working class. . What Pomo is to pizza, this place is to tacos. Authentic. . . absolutely authentic.","Napoli's has been our family's pizza joint my entire life. The pizza is especially delicious when you eat it in the restaurant. I'm 23 now and I still haven't found a pizza place that I like as much. The way it smells when it comes out of the oven is heavenly, and every piece is delectable. The pizza has a tasty, moist crust, and you can't beat the pepperoni.","My first Donato's experience was at the Bobcats game and it was fine. . . but tonight, my husband and I needed a quick fast dinner to go with the big bag of Costco lettuce I bought. . . so we picked up two larger 3 topping pizzas, on special for $20. . Gotta say, the thin crust, toppings all the way to the border, really hit the spot with our bagged salad kit. Quick, easy dinner, fast service. We called to place our order, and 14 minutes later, our order was ready. . The 4 stars, not 5 are because I'd like to see more topping options. . . maybe a BBQ pizza option. . . and the Margarita pizza is drizzled with \"oil\" not olive oil, so I translated that into \"greasy\".","I think this place has nailed it with the fast pizza option! The pesto pizza is my favorite!  The crust is nice and crispy and not too greasy! super great! Staff is always so pleasant and ready to help! So glad they moved into the area right by work, I have gone far too many times already. But hey they are super consistent, so who could blame me. Wishing Continued success to the team!","A pleasant surprise. We went in expecting typical, mass appeal Italian and instead got different and intriguing pizza offerings and an excellent and well-presented stacked salad. We went in 'off hours' and received pleasant service and a meal well prepared. A potential 4-star, but I'll reserve opinion for another visit.","Hands-down the best pizza I've had in vegas. . . I go to the plaza just for the Pizza. . . The only downside is are not open for breakfast. . . I wish they were. . . . The only other place for breakfast is Hash House a go go that place sucks. . . I know they have a food court. . . But it's not quality. . . . Pop up is awesome. . .","I dont think so. . . . first off. . . you get NO incentives to come and play. . . oh wait. . . i just received my 10 dollar free slot play for the ENTIRE month. . . meaning. . . i can play twice this month at 5 dollars a pop. . .

Great Calzones. Pretty good sandwiches. The burgers are rough though. Pretty decent beer selection. Overall a great place to go.","I wasn't sure what to expect at Bannock as I find there is a lot of hype surrounding the O&amp;B enterprise establishments and I'm not convinced that it's even warranted but alas, I've not tried all their restos so I can't really lump them into one and pass judgment on them as though they are one entity--that would be unfair after all. I did try to take a friend from out of town to Bannock a few weeks back as he always has to have poutine when in town and I thought we'd go for the duck poutine pizza just for a change, but reservations were unavailable for the times we wanted them so we had to move on. . I was able to secure seating for a friend and I on Saturday just before a night at the opera. Since the production would be almost five hours long, I thought it best to eat before and after the performance, plus I'm a greedy pig when it comes to food so that was just me being . . . well, greedy. It was busy when we got there, and smelled pretty good. The place has an open kitchen which is the first thing you notice when you walk through the revolving doors which I think used to house the Bay's Juicy Couture section, if I recall correctly. It's a nice little space, a little tight in some areas but manageable. . I was intent on sharing the duck poutine pizza with my friend as people seem to rave about it and also of its volume, but when I saw what the guy next to us was having (pulled pork stuffed in a bannock with a scrumptious and busy-looking salad on the side), I couldn't NOT have a bannock! I didn't want to be suffering itis during the never-ending opera, all cramped-up in those little seats with so little legroom, so I suggested we order a bannock and a salad and share, while he continue knocking back a few drinks at the same time (I suppose this was in preparation for the opera--dammit, why can't I find a man who loves the opera as much as I do??). I was confused when our order came but it appears the waitress either got our order wrong or gave us someone else's meal but we ended up with a cheeseburger and what was probably the Bannock caesar salad. Both were very good, so I didn't mind the mix-up. The salad was fresh and the greens were nice and crunchy with just the right amount of flavour and texture, thanks to the shaved cheese, peppercorns, and bannock croutons which were haphazardly torn up by hand and tossed into the salad. The \"High River Alberta ground brisket\" burger was suuuuper-beefy-tasting and I enjoyed it a lot, quite delicious! It came in a bun that was much like challa bread but a slightly sweet egg bread for sure, topped with a white cheese (not sure which) and a few large taro crisps, which were perfect! . Service was decent, and normally I might not be so pleased about our order being wrong but I did step out for a moment while my friend ordered and he WAS drinking so who knows what that lush actually ordered! They have salads and other little starters, pizzas and sandwiches, as well as other meat and fish dishes on their menu. I definitely need to go back there to try other items. If you can get a table, I would recommend you check it out. It's the perfect spot if you are planning an evening at the Four Seasons Centre; you can get in and out within about an hour so plan accordingly.","WORSE customer service EVER! My boyfriend and I were even staring at the girl working there wondering at which point she would smile. Everyone was just rude and the pizza was absolutely terrible. It was slimy because of the grease and the dough was undercooked. Seriously, don't waste your money.","Four girls squeezed into a booth. Cue a \"movie\" waiter. . My friend named our waiter as someone you would see in a comedy movie or sitcom--talkative, funny-ish, and always popping up at random times for small chat. Needless to say, our server was very attentive (e. g. , good at recommending/not recommending dishes, clearing the table). He skated the *annoying* line very closely, never crossed it though so hurrah. . Food got thumbs up from us: Med. pizza (really delicious and big for $9), Bison burger (fries were a hit), jambalaya, and dopple chop (it was good, but pricey at $20 for what is received). . Drink-wise: Belgian pale ale (ugh, no. a bit of an off-taste), torched cherry caiprissima (too much lime juice for me, but my friend loved it), and don juan (nice). . Overall, a good experience. But not a place I would have cravings for or feel the need to re-visit. It felt like a safe night-out dinner. Plus you can wear what you'd like, I saw fashions of all kinds without much judgment.","Went to check this place out based on the reviews of other Yelpers. It was a little crowded for dinner on a Thur. evening but they seated us right away. The bus staff was overly helpful (this could just be normal for Montreal) in assisting us with our daughters stroller. They carried it upstairs and parked it out of the way for us. Coming from NY you don't often see service like this. . Anyway, the meals. . . I ordered the pizza and DW had the meat Lasagna. Both meals were pretty sizable and we both thoroughly enjoyed the food. The wine \\ beer list was pretty extensive as well which was a plus.  . Don't be fooled standing outside this place, there is a massive multi-tiered upstairs dining area. I would definitely check this out while in Montreal. Hell we're here for a few more days we might hit it up again.","The pizza was absolutely rancid. I live in a place riddled with horrible 99 cent pizza places which are so bad, a pita with ketchup and government cheese would be comparable. This is WORSE than that. The bread sticks were . . . edible, the hotwings were about as good as Dominos (when they feel like being stingy with the sauce), but the onion rings were garbage. Probably frozen, definitely processed, and tasted like cold mashed potatoes that just got a divorce. If this is the only place open and you're hungry late at night, drink some water and have a good breakfast the next day.","I went out for dinner with the gf for date night, and we were both blown away. We ordered the meatballs as an appetizer to start. Their sauce is so good, I can easily drink it in a glass and it's a bonus that the meatballs were a good size. One more piece of garlic bread would have made it better. We both ordered wood oven pizzas and we were more than happy with the taste and size. The flavors of savory and spicy meats worked perfectly on my Italian version of a meatlover pizza(I wish I could have wrote this at the table to remember the name, but no cell on date night haha). We were both so stuff that dessert was not an option. . . The place is small, but it was packed for the dinner rush. Although this didn't affect us, I would recommend anyone coming with more than 4 people to book in advance. Other than that, we can't wait to go back.","I've been to a lot of gyms across the GTA, . . a lot. . . and by far, this is my FAVORITE location!  The staff and trainers are great! They're super friendly, very knowledgeable, and they actually care about their members.  . The gym itself is very well maintained, always clean, and there's a variety of (fairly new-looking) equipment to choose from - I've rarely ever had to wait to use a machine or weights during rush hour, which is quite unusual, especially for gyms in the area. I love the fact that it has free WIFI and I can use it 24/7. And I also love the fact that Anytime Fitness is international, so if I ever accidentally eat an entire box of pizza in Rome I will have absolutely NO excuse to miss a workout (unless of course I also accidentally consume an entire bottle of wine). . What I love the most about this Richmond Hill location is its comfortable and non-intimidating atmosphere. I actually look forward to working out. Anyway I can't boast enough about this gym!","I just wanted to update my review of Streets. We have turned into Friday night regulars. There is no question of where we go on Friday nights now, Streets it is. Stacey, Britney, and the rest of the staff and great. We have had a good bit of the food they have to offer and have absolutely no complaints. The lasagna, spaghetti, and pasta dishes they serve are always good and large portion, which usually yield enough for lunch the next day. The pizza as mentioned in my previous review is great. The passion cookie dessert is still phenomenal when we are not too full from the other great food. I would recommend this establishment to anyone looking for good italian or pizza. We will definitely be going back, every Friday that is.","Italian beef 3 star   pizza 2 star    cannoli a big fat 0   management lets pick it up.   staff pretty much ill trained.","Made a reservation for 2 people on a Saturday night, and thank God! It was Very packed. But such a surprise to find an authentic place like this in Laval! The pizza was amaaazing and the tiramisu, even better!!","Waited too long for my pizza to arrive and manager was no help, only to offer 25% off in the future. If you want to wait 2. 5 hours for your order after being told it would only take an hour, then this is your place.","This place is located in the Palais des Congres de Montreal. It serves paninis, pizza, salad, and some cooked caseroles of meat. I had several paninis here and they all tasted good. The chicken soup was just OK. It's a smal eatery and it can get crowded during a convention. Come early if you can. The staff was generally courteous and accommodating. They accept America Express cards.","I really really enjoyed this place. Lets break it down:. ATMOSPHERE:. Really adorable joint. Reminds me of Europe it its quaintness factor. Small tables, cute bar. I loved it. . SERVICE:. Good service. . . . as we sat and ate we watched them accommodate lots of families with big strollers. I thought that was top notch of them. The service was casual, but we never felt ignored at all. . FOOD:. Aha! The reason we're all here. The food was awesome. We started with the grande misto which is basically meat, olives, cheese and tomatoes. So GOOD! I really enjoy this type of starter. Simple, salty, satisfying. . My husband had the MARCO pizza which was an adventure for our palates. With an Italian cream sauce base and toppings that kept your tongue guessing and a lovely crisp crust. . . . how can we complain. . I had the gnocchi which you could tell was homemade. It melted in your mouth. My portion was a bit small which was my only complaint but thats ok, I had some of his pizza to make up for it ;). Finally we had dessert. The lemon shortcake was cute and tart and the deconstructed napoleon (which I thought was gonna be a snorefest) was really yummy!. I would totally come back here. Loved it.","Been here a number of times, never disappointed. . Sometimes if you're in the bar area music and noise it's a little loud but the food is always amazing. . In the main dining room, the menu replicates the original location in Euclid's menu. But as my wife says, don't get the lobster ravioli, it ain't that great!. Tons of great choices on the menu the Vasj pizza is always a great choice.","The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the food is really good. However, the customer service is NOT good. I always feel like I am being rushed. The waiting time is outrageous as it usually is 1. 5 - 2 hrs for 3 people when I go. Also the pizza is usually all burned when I received it. Not a huge fan. .","Market pizzas are always unique and amazing! I come here 1-2 times a week- it's our little neighborhood go-to. All of the food is delicious. We have tried everything on the menu and you won't be disappointed with each item! Home made pastas and pizza. Bruschetta is out of this world! Plus they have a great selection of wine and beer. Definitely should try this if you're looking for great food and great prices.","What a great pizza place this is. With a saturated market, I would imagine any place that sustains itself has to be good or would just be lost in the shuffle of chain pizza places.  . So my wife and I decided to give it a try with this in mind. The balance of toppings, cheese, and sauce was just perfect. The sauce is no doubt what sets this place apart from the competition. Very tasty with lots of spices.","This restaurant is one of good choice if you are looking for not so expensive pizza and wings with a good taste. Very convenient and rarely a problem to get great tasting food from. We order from here a ton when having a party or get together with friends and family.","I don't care who you are, this place is the best. . . . best everything! . Ima let you finish. . . . . but Joe's shakes are the best of alll time! . No seriously their shakes are the best. I have had the vanilla and strawberry and couldn't stop talking about them for days after. Yum! . Joe's is another one of those wonderful places that have been featured on Diner, Drive-Ins and Dives. Joe's grows just about all their produce right on the farm so its more than fresh, and all their meats and everything else is Arizona grown or as close to it as possible. They have a great outdoor picnic type seating area outside, or indoor seating. Great for the family and your dogs. Next door they have Joe's Farm Cafe, with some of the same food as in the restaurant, great coffee and tea and other sweets. Then probably my favor tie part, they have a little farm stand where they sell what produce they have available at the time. Last time I was there I got some cherries that were out of this world good! It is an \"Honor System\" stand where you pick out what you want then put your money is a little lock box and then go on your merry way. So cute! . When you go out there I will recommend the BBQ pulled pork (they have award winning BBQ sauce), any of the salads, the BBQ chicken pizza and/or the season shake.","Again, I'm slow on the review uptake. . . . I'm an avid hiker and after a long day in Red Rock, I want food NOW.  My hiking buddies and I decided to check out Mark Rich's in the Albersons' complex on Charleston and Desert Foothills. I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed my lunch!  My group ordered a variety of items, including the tuna melt sandwich, chicken wings, and spinach calzone. Portions: large. Service: really nice! (and super accommodating when it came to splitting the cheque). Food: yummy!  Of course, anything with cheese pretty much guarantees a party in the mouth (even for lactose-intolerant folks like myself), but I didn't notice overgreasiness (is that a word?). . I'm sorry that I can't comment on the pizza -- funny how no one in my group ordered any pizza at a pizza joint! -- but perhaps I'll update this review after my next post-hike lunch. It looks like this place suffers a little from inconsistent quality, judging from the yelp reviews, but on my visit, everything was good enough to warrant a second visit.","Service - 3. Serivce wasn't bad but their resort fee is not included in your initial bill so be prepared to pay an addiontal $50 (estimate) per night.  . Location - 5. Great location. Right in the middle of the strip. Across the street from Cesars. . Ambiance - 4. Nothing to write home about. I thought the colors were fun. Also there were some live  flamingos, turtles, and koi fish. . The best part of this hotel is the pool. Very large 21 and over section with good music and wasn't too crowded. . Product - 4. We got a \"GO\" room which I had read were more recently renovated. Not a bad room but nothing special about it really. He AC worked but we had it on full best the entire time and I'm not sure our room get below 69 degrees. Also the wifi was pretty awful. I had planned on doing some work while I was there but the signal was too poor for me to get anything done. . I am a blackjack player and they had some $5 tables which are always fun for casual gamblers like myself. Margaritaville is also attached to the hotel which also has some tables that open up later in the day. . Bonnanos was our restaurant of choice during our stay. More for the garlic knots than the pizza. Those things were like crack. . Overview - 4 stars. Would recommend. It had everything you need to enjoy vegas: decent room, on the strip, fun pool, good gambling, and restaurants.","Their deep dish with the garlic crust is everything!!! Loved it so much. I also love that they use fresh veggies. A lot of the pizza delivery spots have stopped using real ingredients. Highly recommend Jet's!","Yeah!   We've now been to Nellos a half dozen or so times, tried several of their pizzas, sat at the bar, on the patio, in the dining room, you name it.    . I like the place. I like the atmosphere. I like the grub!  They have a nice selection of craft brews, decent wine selection and while they don't always have it in stock,  from time to time my wife is able to get cava rose. . We've had the Chef's Board - a nice charcuterie selection, cheeses and accoutrements, but our favorite app is the Fritto Misto. Ask for a side of their house made marinara to go with the Fritto Misto, it's delicious and much better than the weird sauce that comes with the dish.  . Come dicono gli italiani, ora per la pizza!  Here are the selections we've made thus far:. Original Crust Pizzas:. --Classic European. --Deluxe Combo. Both great pizzas, I like the Deluxe better. It has more meats!  . Wood Fired Specialty Pizzas (12\" thin crust):. --Yukon Gold (+Egg+Shrooms). --Pavone Pepperoni. IMHO, the two standouts were the Wood Fired thin crust pizzas. The Yukon Gold, with thin slices of potato (duh!) is delicious. But the most standout is the Pavone Pepperoni. It is not, at all, your basic pepperoni pizza. Leveraging huge slices of Schreiner's Pavone Pepperoni, Nello's own house Mozzarella and torn basil, it's a rich, full flavored treat and I can virtually guarantee you'll order it again.    . Buon Appetito!!","I love the ambiance at Buca - the warm lighting, wooden tables, the visible cured meat locker, and wine cellar just adds to an already cozy restaurant. The service was excellent, however the food was not up to snuff. Mind you they had food here that it'll be hard to find anywhere else. A few items we tried were fried pig's ear, lamb brain wrapped in bacon. I was pleasantly surprised with the pig ear, I was reluctant to try it at first, but man once i had a bite - it was good! The lamb brain, let's just say it has an interesting texture and taste. The bacon did nothing to mask the taste, which I wish it did. We also ordered some lamb skewers that were quite good. . For my meal i ordered a beet and bread crumb salad, and a cured meat pizza. Both dishes were a tad too salty for my liking. But the pizza crust was quite good. Perhaps i would've enjoyed my pizza if it had other toppings. Each pizza will come with scissors for you to cut. Brilliant! I believe this place has a lot of potential, each individual menu is date stamped so you know they constantly update it. For that they deserve a second chance, will definitely come back to try other items. I'm sure other friends at my table would've given 4 or 5 stars, just that i was unfortunate ordering what i ordered. Reservations are a must for Buca on the weekend, we had dinner at 5:30 and the place was packed by 6.","Very good decorated cookies - if you can get them. Hours are 'bakery' rather than for working people, next to no parking and the sell out. Ok, I understand that but if the item sold out a day ago then you'd have time to make more, yes? Shrug. Great baked goods and I'd love to try pizza one weekend.","I got a cheese pizza and wings and the pizza was disgusting. It tasted and looked like cheddar cheese on the pizza and tasted like cheesy sodium. It was horrific. The wings were really good, but I'd never order from here again. Terrible terrible pizza.","My best friend and I were doing a lot of running around and needed to grab a quick lunch so we came here. We heard they were great for the meatballs and garlic bread. . The garlic bread was in the shape of a knot and they where huge and very garlicky. They tasted really good but  a bit too much garlic. . The meatballs honestly weren't the greatest and they where overly used with garlic!. The pizza was just a normal brick oven pizza nothing special at all. . A little while latter man was I sick. I think it's way too much garlic used in the food. My friend and I were vomiting from the food. It was so bad.","This Rosati's pizza lacked the quality I've had at other Rosati's pizza. They overcooked it and it had a slightly charred flavor to it, both times I went to this place. The customer service was poor both times because I felt rushed and the employees did not care to help me and seemed like they would rather be someplace else. I'm not saying all Rosati's are bad because I also frequent the Rosati's at 28th and Thunderbird, and it is fantastic compared to this one (Both in customer service and food).","Aiello's does a truly great white pizza: one of the best I've ever had. I can also recommend Aiello's strombolis and margherita pizza. In general, their flavor profile tends toward the nutty satisfaction of parmesan and roasted garlic. It's winter pizza, good for warming your belly for a walk home in the snow. Mineo's down the street is more summer pizza, thinner crust and more of an emphasis on sauce that gives you a jolt of energy on warm twilit evenings.  . Aiello's is open fairly late and their pizza reheats well, so it's ideal for those of us who often find our way there after a long day's work. In house slices are cheap, though getting a fresh pie for a party can get pricy.","We came to Romeo on our first night in Montreal, as we got in late and made a mad dash for the SAQ. On our way we had seen Romeo and thought it was cute, so we decided we'd check it out on our way back. The cocktails sounded delicious, as did the pizza. . The three of us decided to split 2 pizzas: l'estivale and la figue bleu. They were amazing. We hadn't realized how hungry we were until we were devouring those pizzas. We entirely forgot about the hot pepper oil for the crust (which is a shame!). . We also ordered some cocktails: a spritzer and some sangria. Both were quite good, and the lychee was a nice touch to the sangria. Though, despite the menu saying that you could order sangria with red or white wine, they apparently only had red. . . I had a bit of a hiccup with my order of it, but in the end, it all turned out fine (aka I got a glass of sangria and it was tasty).","Horrible please if your buying pizza on a budget just settle for lil ceasers. The pizza is horrible here the wings are greasy as hell. And the customer service sucks!!!!!!!!! I ordered a pizza online 7:40ish it said it will arrive in a hour. . . . . . . ok and hour goes by I call check on it someone nonchalantly picks up and says it'll be here soon here comes 9 at this point my kids haven't ate dinner there sleepy avatars I don't even want it anymore so I call to get a refund. In the middle of me talking to them they hang up. I call back they hang up. Then they tell me you have to go to the store to get a refund. Then 9:50 Pizza Hut calls in in the lobby. We go ahead and get it anyways the pizza is cold ass hell the wings are greasy like they were never drained just thrown directly in to the bowl. Just horrible don't waste your time or money. And this isn't the first time they took over an hour to deliver  but this will be the last time!","Trying to find a quick bite in the middle of a haboob (look it up, ) we escaped into Hungry Howie's to get something quick but didn't want pizza. We thought we were out of luck but we did manage to get a chicken Caesar salad and I had Asian boneless chicken wings. We shared a diet lemonade and then braved the dust storm to get to our show nearby at the Higley Center for the Performing Arts, the 27th time I have seen a production of \"Les Miserables. \"  Food was what it was and I've had better,  but there just weren't any other choices nearby.","They have great soups and pizza! Their bread stick are addicting so be careful you don't eat to many of those before your meal gets to your table. Everyone is very friendly when you walk in the door. Good food:)","First I'll start off with the terrible service. We were initially being helped by a lady server but she had to switch with the super tall, dark gentleman that was working the bar area. He was so busy doing other things (getting people drinks, working the register, talking to people at the bar) that our lunch turned into an almost 2 hour lunch. We never got refills on water until I had to flag him down and then he filled up 2 of the 4 empty water cups and walked away. He then said he was going to bring us bread and disappeared for like 20 minutes. We ordered 4 pasta dishes and the cook put the plates out for our server to bring to our table and we literally sat there for a really long time watching our food get cold while our server was by the bar talking to other customers and doing other things behind the bar. When we got our food, he never came around to ask how things were and when we needed our check and some boxes, he was nowhere to be found. The worst part of all, when we did pay and he processed the credit card and came back, he did this martial arts bow to us like we were supposed to be impressed by that and thanked us for coming in. My family is Asian so that's pretty inappropriate to do and I didn't see him bowing to his other white customers. Really ignorant, but what can you do?. The food was ok, we ordered the pesto penne pasta, the jambalaya pasta, the kung pao speghetti, and the garlic fetticcini alfredo. The pesto penne tasted ok but the pasta wasn't cooked and was still hard. It wasn't even al dente, it was still uncooked and that made the dish hard to eat. The jambalaya pasta was good, seasoned well and had good flavor. The garlic alfredo was also good but was a tad on the salty side. The kung pao speghetti was pretty good for a pizza restaurant. It was super spicy and saucy. . Overall, I probably wouldn't come back unless I had to. There's plenty of other restaurants that are fast, make good quality food, and have servers that don't waste your time or do stupid things.","5 stars! Going back! Great place definitely worth checking out! I first went to Vapiano's with my roommate and her mom on her visit here. My first impression was great- a sign outside the place announcing their special of $3. 50 OMB drafts. . Upon arrival the hostess greeted us with a big smile, asked if we had been there before and offered an explanation of how to swipe and dine! She gave us each our own cards to use, we grabbed up our own menus and headed to the table of our choice. . Above the food stations there is a huge chalkboard with fun sayings and drawings- nice touch! My roommate loved that each table has its own herbs you can pick off and use to add to your meal. Cases holding the herbs double as decor in this updated interior space. . I've been back several times since that first visit and have not been with anyone who has had a disappointing meal. Vapiano menu ranges in price from $3. 95-$9. 95! 5 main selections on the menu including: antipasti, insalate, pizza dela casa, pasta, and panini.  . 3/4 times I have visited, live acoustic guitar with great jams accompanied the already fun, inviting and laid back atmosphere. . Yay Vapiano!","Update: I had eaten at Destihl a couple months ago, and the best word for my dining experience at that point would be \"inconsistent. \" Last night I returned to Destihl so that I could form a more definite opinion. For my main course, I ordered the Brewmaster's Pizza, which was served with chicken, andouille sausage, ale onions, and an espresso-chipotle barbecue sauce. The pizza was nothing to rave about, but it probably would have been quite a bit better if a) the pizza had been served hot instead of lukewarm and rapidly cooling, and b) the crust had been cooked all the way through. My brother's pizza was also apparently cold and undercooked, and reading through the other reviews, this seems to be common for diners at Destihl who order pizza. I think I've probably accumulated enough evidence at this point--Destihl is not worth the high prices. There are so many better restaurants in Champaign.","This restaurant is one of those places that you so happen to pass by and knowing the name on the restaurant always wonder what the food would taste like, only to finally try it and fall in love. That's what happened with me and Morimoto Las Vegas--love at first bite. . To prepare yourself for a place such as Morimoto, you need to get the idea of all you can eat sushi taste as well as any other Sushi you've tried in your local Town that's considered the best sushi and throw that taste memory out the window for this experience. Once you've completed that task when you arrive at the restaurant sit down and prepare yourself for a culinary Journey. This restaurant is more than just a sushi place. The food here is eclectic, covering everything that you've seen him cover in his Iron Chef episodes, ranging from Italian to Thai to Japanese, of course. . There are few signature dishes that you must try and if your server tells you about the Omakase menu which is a price fix menu for the evening, you should definitely get it. We wanted to try everything that we've seen him do in Iron Chef episodes and fixed-price menu was perfect. Don't think about the number of courses that you are about to get because the food that you receive is filling and six courses is perfect. We did add on to items because we wanted to try it no matter what the case was and that was the tuna pizza and their special role of the day which, in this case, was the rainbow roll made with real snow crab not the imitation crab you find in other sushi restaurants. . We started with an appetizer that was not on the menu for our servers suggestion. The tune of pizza with anchovy aioli, topped with marinated purple olives, jalapeno, and greens, on a crispy tortilla cracker was a great starter. The crispy tortilla was as thin and as crisp as a cracker with the soft beautiful tuna sashimi and the perfectly salty and Briny aioli kicked off the evening with a bang. . Our first official Omakase course was an appetizer of tuna tartare made the way that he makes it on Iron Chef America. The tote are came in a square glass plate finely minced alongside several toppings including Wasabi, a sweet soy reduction, rice puffs, wasabi cream, and creme fraiche. A dipping sauce and crisp bread with Morimoto caviar completed the experience. It was decadent and fun to eat with a flat \"shovel\". After polishing off the tartare, I ate the sweet plum that comes with it to cleanse my palete for the next course. . Wagyu Carpaccio topped with Summer truffle shavings and lightly cooked in hot oil and soy was our next course. The walk was extremely tender and easy to melt in my mouth and with the shavings of Summer truffle and a few touches of microgreens it was the perfect bite. The size of the Carpaccio was absolutely perfect for the flavor that it gave. It was filled with unami. I honestly could have eaten three or four of them in a row. . The third course had to be one of the most fun dishes I've ever eaten. It was a fondue served with tomato inside the cheese as well as a touch of olive oil and a small sprig of rosemary. Around the fondue plate there was togarashi for heat, as well as fresh muscle, shrimp, fish balls made in House of course, as well as vegetables and something very unique that they make their, called a salmon ship. With the house noodles provided with the fondue plate, at the end I mixed the noodles in and it became a spaghetti course with an Asian Flair. . The 4th course was our Sushi course which consisted of the additional side order of rainbow roll which was their special role for the evening. The Maki was amazing, but the star of the entire course was the one nigiri piece of fatty tuna. It absolutely melted in my mouth and was one of the best things I've ever eaten. With just a touch of wasabi, each nigiri piece was amazing, from the Saba to the snapper. I believe the other critics when they say that Morimoto has the best sushi on the strip, hands down. . Finally the main course arrived which was our surf and turf. Are surf and turf for the evening was American wagyu cooked medium rare with shiitake mushroom and two types of sauce, grilled pearl onions, and micro bok choy, as well as a lobster tail and Claw served with purple potato and a sweet potato puree of some sort. Everything on the plate was amazing, from the wagyu that melted in the mouth and was perfectly cooked, as well as the lobster tail, which was tender, buttery, and sweet. . With our bellies full we successfully made it to the desert , which is the one you will see every time you look up Morimoto Las Vegas. This desert is his chocolate sphere filled with marshmallow whipped and a chocolate sorbet. It was just incredible. Textures abound and rich, it was the best ending to the experience. . You just try this restaurant, even if it's a once in a lifetime event. It is worth every penny.","Thank you fellow Yelpers! Was in Montreal for the weekend and Yelp helped me find a great place to eat. I got kudos from my friends for finding such a great spot. We were staying just outside Chinatown so this place was very central. As soon as we walked in, the music was great, and it was such a friendly atmosphere. I ordered the chicken  and my friends had pizzas which they enjoyed. One of our friends ordered a stuffed pasta. I can't remember the name of it but the portion size was extremely small and she didn't seem to enjoy it much. The best part was we told the waiter we were celebrating my friend's bachelorette and he wouldn't let us leave without having a tequila shot, on him! And he even joined us. He said it was to celebrate and apologize for the wait but we honestly weren't even waiting that long!","Best pizza delivery with fresh ingredients!  Have it delivered as restaurant is very basic.","I really enjoyed flour &amp; barley. My wife and I are here after buying a travelzoo voucher. With the voucher the prices were reasonable. The food was excellent and had a great beer selection. The server was helpful in selecting drinks and pizzas. I would come back when I return to Las Vegas.","Went to Marcello, their pizza is one of the best pizza i ever had. Thin crust made in wood fire over with goat cheese and spinach. . Their pasta was fresh, olive oil delicious. . Only one complaint is waiters were not very welcoming. I'll look past that and will definitely go back.","Charming and nice place. Excellent pizza made  in restaurant. BEVO's interior is a great style. Tr\u00e8s bon service, rapide, d\u00e9licieux pizza et bon prix.","Simple place with some great food. I got the carbonara and my wife got the bolognese. We both loved them. I loved the noodles they use and they were cooked to perfection. We got the larges and had leftovers. I'm sure a small would have been fine. Service was fast and friendly. Can't wait to try their pizza but with the pasta so good it'll be tough not ordering that.","We always order pizza and pasta from Rino D's. Delish! It's the only place where we order pizza from. . .","This pizza hut is very hit and miss, but mostly miss. . The main problem is not enough sauce. In order to combat this, I even ordered extra sauce but there was still barely any on the pizza. . They are generally good about giving a lot of crust flavor, but sauce and cheese game is too weak. Better off at Little C's.","Looking to go out instead of ordering a pizza in? Streets of New York has awesome pizza and other Italian dishes as well. The pizza is deep dish and TASTY. It's been reliably good over the years, and continues to offer cuisine that both pleases me and my boyfriend. Not an easy task! It's also great place to hang out with friends when everyone has different tastes because who doesn't like pizza? This location is my favorite in the area because it is bigger, more open, has TV's, and yet still maintains a nice restaurant feel as opposed to manly bar feel. Enjoy!","This place is awesome! From the reviews and atmosphere I knew my boys would love it and I was correct! They all (2 boys plus husband) enjoyed playing Nintendo while we waited for our food. The Boss bread was delicious and addicting and the pizza was hot and fresh. All in all great atmosphere, fun place and delicious food makes Super Pizza Bros a new family favorite for us!","I like their thin crust pizza and I like how they're reasonably priced. I wouldn't say they're amazing and a must try, but it's a fail safe place to order pizza if you're trying to watch your spending. . I don't really have much to say about them, they're alright. I'll continue to order from them again, if Pizza Hut doesn't have a deal :p","My husband and I enjoyed Lago on an early Saturday evening before heading out to a concert. The service was excellent and the food very good. The dayboat scallops were plump, fresh, and delicious on an exceptionally tasty bed of tender Cauliflower, chopped crisp apples, and almonds. Cocktail menu was interesting. My Italian white wine, recommended by the server, was full bodied with a clean finish and quite good. My husband ordered a pizza and was impressed with the size, served on a cutting board, and flavor. Many craft beers from which to chose, as well. Liked the warm low- lighting and contemporary, urban vibe. One complaint: some tables are too close or open to the kitchen, and the clanking of silverware and/or the distraction of bright kitchen light was unpleasant. We asked for a different table, and the hostess kindly obliged. It was wonderful to see Cleveland thriving. Three new restaurants on the East bank of the flats, all looked pretty busy, and the Cavs were out of town!","Always love coming here. Can never go wrong with one of their pizzas. Loaded with toppings and thin bubbly crust. I normally just get one of the pastas but decided on veal. Had an interesting taste but still not bad. We also had the salmon. That was the only meal that disappoint. It was a little fishy. I will be sticking to pizza/pasta from now on.","I Dined here for dinner on a Monday night with my gf for a special occasion. Everything exceeded expectations. The Porterhouse is there speciality and we knew we would be splitting this. The steak was a 60 day dry aged longhorn breed (not angus) and grassfed from a local alberta rancher. The taste was indescribably good and unique. For those not accustomed to grass fed cattle it may take some adjustments to your ideas about how steak should taste but once you go grass you don't go back. This steak would have been more than enough for both of us but we ordered much more. . The beef empanadas were baked to perfection and were bursting with flavour. BUT the biggest surprise came from the pizza! We ordered the Calamari pizza and it was a slam dunk. Not a typical pie but they use Sidewalk Citizen's (bakery next door) sourdough starter for the bread which is thick and crunchy on the outside but chewy and soft on the inside. Mix that with the meltiest and richest cheese smothered all over with thick pesto drizzled all over and you get one of the best pie's in town. . The restaurant is not cheap so don't be surprised to shell out some bucks for a meal here at dinner but it is well worth every penny. I will be back to try their brunch, more pizza, and special occasion meat indulgences.","RePete's is a big improvement to that enjoyable dump that was there before, a fan of both establishments :D  I've been here a few times for late night/early morning eating and once for that game 7 of the NBA final BOO HEAT BOO!!! haha . Last time I've checked their Happy Hour was 1/2 pizzas and apps Mondays-Fridays 3pm to 6 pm and midnight to 3am. And their beers were reasonably prices with a decent selection of craft brews. . If Buffalo Wild Wing, Outback Steakhouse, or any of the other alcohol/food selling businesses are busy and you need a place to go RePete's is just as spacy, not as crammed, and has a better tasting food menu. I am a fan of their menu though I haven't had everything yet. It's mostly better than your typical bar food and includes calamari fries which were pretty big pieces, greek meatballs which I was told was their patrons favorites they were OK , nachos which were pretty huge, various pizzas so far all delicious, monte cristo and other sandwiches, salmons and steaks, pasta, etc. . I've only had one horrible experience with them and that was when they had the hardest time splitting checks and adjusting the prices on the bill when it switched from happy hour prices  to regular prices. Other then that most of the customer service has been good. . They have plenty of tables and TVs and are well maintained. Great place to hang out  enjoy a few brews close to the strip or to wait while the females shop.","We decided to try this place the other night. We ordered a supreme pizza and wings. The menu is pretty extensive. The food was delicious!  Very busy on a Friday night at 5. We would like to go back when it's a little less busy and try something else. Definitely a sports bar feel but with much better food. The only draw back. . . we wanted to sit out on the patio on a beautiful October evening, but people were smoking out there. It was way too stinky and gross. I wish they would make it all non smoking. People can go without a cigarette for an hour. It ruins it for the rest of us. . We went again and the food was good, once again however, the patio was too smoky to enjoy the beautiful Az fall weather. Sad face!","At Westgate for the USA vs Colombia match and m daughters wanted pizza. We decided to try Mama Gina's were so glad we did! This pizza is awesome!! Get in here and have some today, today!!!","Restaurant quality Mexican food for half the price of going to a Mexican restaurant and super fast service. . . better tacos and tostadas than the majority of high end Mexican restaurants. Cheapest and strongest margaritas in town! Every time I go I have to have one. . . their Mexican pizza is on  another level, a must try! I love this spot!","Formule gagnante boisson et pizza , pas pire pizza mince , j'ai bien aim\u00e9. Terrasse et boisson servies sur pots massons comme la rue.","Ordered pizza , mozzarella sticks and breadsticks. Delivery took over an hour and then they gave me meatballs instead of mozzarella sticks. Not similar at all.","I eat here all the time (sit in, take-out, and delivery). The food is so delicious. I order the penne arrabiata or a margherita pizza and they are both very, very good. The house salad and the arugula salad are both top notch. The salad dressings are so good, especially the house salad port fig vinaigrette we went out and tried to recreate it so we could eat it at home more often! One of the bests parts about sitting in the restaurant is being able to order the absolutely amazing sangria! The service is always great every time I've come here! I will definitely continue to come back here!","Best Pizza in the area hands down! Not greasy like chicago's and chain pizza joints. Highly recommend checking it out. Guys are super nice running the place and focused on making sure you are pleased with the order.","Grimaldi's pizza is great at most of their locations. The one at Fashion Show Mall for some reason is exceptional!! Always great. Top notch service and the manager Mike takes excellent care of the guests. Maybe that's why the service is so spot on, the manager cares!","Food: world famous coconut shrimp, Thai curry shrimp and scallops, baby back BBQ pork ribs, kids margherita pizza, special of the day seafood bisque, key lime pie, triple chocolate cake, chocolate ganache cake. . The best items were the coconut shrimp, Thai curry and key lime pie. I would go there just to eat the key lime pie. So limey and refreshing and the graham cracker crust was perfection with the perfect amount of salt. YUM. The. Best. Ever. Nice big slice too enough for two to share. . Ambiance: really cute island feel. Made me feel like I'm on vacation in Hawaii or some tropical place. . Service: a little slow in checking in on us, but overall satisfactory. The waitress brought my daughter an extra amuse bouche, which was appreciated. . Location: conveniently located inside Town Square near the open green area.","OK, if it wasn't for the weird service we experienced, this would totally be 5 stars. At first, our server spent a lot of us time with us going over all the different beers and was super knowledgeable and basically just a really good server. Halfway into dinner he disappeared and other people started bringing us our food. When we asked where he was, we were told that he was in the  back doing other things. At the end of dinner he returned to being our server but also bartender so we were basically ignored. Very weird service. . We tried 11 of the 14 beers they make. I personally like really hoppy beers, but alas I can't remember the names of the ones I liked. For appetizers we ordered the chorizo stuffed dates, which were AMAZING! We also ordered lamb meatballs. I love anything with goat cheese so both of these appetizers were right up my alley. In the past, I have also gotten beer battered asparagus which is also super delicious. . Originally, I ordered the pesto and goat cheese pizza but unfortunately it was very soggy and my plate was drenched in grease. Even the server commented that it was excessively soggy. I sent it back, which is something I NEVER do. I then ordered the flat iron quesadillas from the appetizers as my dinner. It didn't disappoint. . My favorite part was definitely the chorizo stuffed dates.","Exactly what I was looking for. The price is great, and everything we tried was really tasty. Cheesy bread, pizza, chicken parm sandwich, cheesecake, and lemon cake were all good. Staff is courteous and helpful. I'll definitely be back.","Best pizza in Las Vegas! Just like in NY. It's authentic ny pizza, they also have many sandwiches and such which I haven't tried because I always want the pizza. Their white pizza is unreal too.","First off, let me preface this with us having read the Yelp reviews, so we expected to wait for our food. We had a $30 Groupon discount for this establishment, so we figured it would make a good date night. It turned out that this was the worst experience we have ever had at a restaurant. . The place was busy, a good sign. We are told that it would be about 15 minutes to get seated. No worries. There is a bar and a lounge (a couch, pool table, and 3 arcade games). There is not any real seating and it is uncomfortably warm in the waiting area.  . We finally get seated, look over the menu, and then order. First off, we order an appetizer, pasta, a pizza, and I also order a beer. Our waitress says they do not have that beer. Not as in they ran out, but as in they do not stock it. We show her the menu and she asks another waitress before she accepts it an takes down the order. We get glasses of water. . And we wait. . . and wait. . . and wait. . . . Maybe 30 minutes later, my beer is finally served. Soon after, the appetizer shows up. Okay, so they are busy. Definitely short staffed; maybe some of their staff called out. But now, we are at the head of the queue and they are preparing our food. . . or so we hoped. . And we wait. . . and wait. . . and wait. . . . Our bruschetta is long gone, our water is nearly empty, and I am trying to make my beer last. All of our talk between my girlfriend and I has petered out, we have looked around at all of the other patrons, and have succumbed to staring at the ceiling. My bowl of pasta arrives. As I am a gentleman, I do not start eating and wait for my girlfriend's pizza to arrive. . And we wait. . . and wait. . . and wait. . . . Most restaurants would question when one single-serving plate is delivered, and there are two people sitting at the table. They would inquire if you are waiting for any more food. At this point, we are gave up on a good dinner and are just waiting to see how long until they notice that they messed up. The romantic atmosphere is gone. She begs me to eat my food before it gets cold. I try to give her some, but she only take a few bites. I begin to eat my pasta, hoping that at any moment her food would be delivered. . And we wait. . . and wait. . . and wait. . . . I am over half way done with my plate before the waitress comes over to ask me how my food was, when she realizes something is wrong and asks my girlfriend if she is waiting on anything. We inform her that we are still waiting on a pizza. The waitress leaves our table to go back and check on it. She soon returns and apologizes because she forgot to put in the order for the pizza, but she says she will comp the pizza. Okay. . . mea culpa. She says in exact terms, that it will be out in 8 minutes. We wait eight minutes. . . . And we wait. . . and wait. . . and wait. . . . I am done with my pasta. All of our drinks are bone dry. We tell our waitress that she should put the pizza in a to-go box. She tells us that it will be out in just a few minutes. She asks us about how we want to use our $60 groupon or save it for next time. We inform her that it was only a $30 groupon. We could have gone with it and got an extra $30 worth of free food, but it was not worth it. We already said how we are never going to come back and there is no way we were going to wait any longer for more food to be prepared and served. So at this point, we know between the groupon and the comp, our bill would be basically nothing. . And we wait. . . and wait. . . and wait. . . . At this time, there are very few people still eating in the restaurant. Another waitress comes over and asks us if we wanted refills, we decline because we know it will take an eternity and we just cannot wait to leave. I am biting my tongue trying not to explode as my girlfriend praises me for not making a scene. I put my head in my hands. . And we wait. . . and wait. . . and wait. . . . After a time of 8 minutes plus 30, the hostess who is now cleaning tables approaches us and asks us if everything is okay. I ask her to go please check on the status of our pizza. She says that is it being boxed and will be right out. Almost immediately, the pizza is brought out. That makes me think that it was sitting and waiting to be brought out. . . for who knows how long.  . We are presented with a bill for $1. 08. Seriously. . . We wait for over one and a half hours for some bread with tomatoes, a bowl of pasta, and a pizza, and then you have the audacity to not comp the remaining dollar?!?  . We leave the restaurant. The only thing I want to do is run; praying that the food does not get me sick.","Nice hole in the wall pizza place. Friendly staff. Good pizza. Take out only was a surprise. I didn't notice that till my wife and I got there but great to take home and eat. We will be back.","My first time here for lunch today after a work gig. Got their $9 Margherita pizza (with extra basil) and their beet Caprese salad. Both were yummy! Even though they were towards the smaller portion size, I felt they were enough to keep me full and I had a bit of leftover for later. The staff was super friendly and the ambience was beautiful! Would definitely recommend for an economical and freshly made cheat meal - tons of cheese and dough!","We've taken out from here several times over the years, and it was neither good nor bad, just ordinary take-out, but usually worth the trip for a quick dinner. Until tonight, when it was bad, just bad. Chicken with rice soup? They should call it a lot of wet rice with a few bits of chicken. Is soupless soup the new thing? That went straight into the fridge: I'll think about adding chicken broth, ginger, and maybe some shredded carrots. To salvage the flavorless shrimp lo mein and chicken fried rice, I had to re-stir fry each dish in a bit of sesame oil, adding generous amounts of sliced fresh ginger and minced garlic, and some soy sauce, along with vegetables (just some limp onions in the original, so I put in chopped peppers and some frozen peas). The alternative was throwing it all out and cooking pasta instead, but I was determined to get something for the $20 I shelled out tonight. I've never tried those places where you pick up a pizza, take it home, and bake it in the oven. But now I can say I've done something quite similar with Chinese take-out. Not an experience I want to repeat, but I suppose Julia Child would have been pleased with the salvage efforts.","My oppinion is pretty bias because im from Brooklyn NY home of the best pizza ever! lol. . . my kids liked the pizza here-nothing extrodinary tho. The best part of the meal was the Free bread, I can eat their bread all day. The \"charred wings\" had no char and tasted like anyone else's wings, I ordered the Eggplant Rollatini, I'm a huge fan of eggplant and had very high hopes for this dish but I was very disappointed smh it tasted like something that was in the freezer for a long time, Deep fried and smothered with sauce-No bueno. . the calimari wasn't good either. Service was good but the food was not. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay full price for all of that good I went on a Wednesday when it's not 50% off your entire check, so that's a plus","We come here regularly especially during football season. We love the staff and the gluten free pizza is about as good as gluten free anything can be. The wine list is pretty extensive and my husband loves their fried mozzarella. All around a great experience.","My Dad owned an upscale pizzeria in Oregon and this pizza is better than his-and his was amazing- (sorry, Dad!)!! We got the Chicago style stuffed crust pepperoni/black olive pizza and it was the best pizza I have EVER had. . Cool environment and decor, always seems to be busy, and we had great service. Will definitely be back to see try other things on the menu.","I really like this place; the staff is friendly and quick plus it's not far from my home so that's a bonus for me. We went here last night with friends for happy hour. They have several food and drink specials plus you can get a slice of cheese pizza for $1 (pepperoni, sausage and margarita are also available for an extra charge). I ordered a slice with onion and they did make it for me, but apparently they don't offer any other toppings other than the ones I listed so just keep that in mind. . Another thing to keep in mind, that I wish they would have noted some place or at least told us about before ordering, is that they only give 1 happy hour food item/drink. I found this annoying since 2 slices of pizza and a beer was a great meal and a deal but when we got our bill we questioned the prices and at that time we were told about the policy. That lost this place a star. Hey, I get it, it's a good policy to have but customers who are clearly there enjoying happy hour should be told this PRIOR to placing additional orders. Plus apparently ordering a bottle of wine during happy hour doesn't count as more than 2 drinks? I'm pretty sure a bottle holds 4-5 glasses of wine so again, I do not approve of this policy. If 4 people had shared that bottle would that have been 4 drinks? Anyways. . . it's still a good place to checkout regardless of this recent annoyance.","Have you seen all my photos yet of Five50 food? Delicious!!!! try not to lick the photos! 550 Degrees for the oven temperature for the best pizzas! Come get some!","Ordered 2 pies for Delivery with multiple different toppings and crusts. They obviously have no concept of what 'Light Sauce' is. The 1 pizza has so much sauce, it drowned the toppings. Had to throw it away. There was so much sauce, the pie was bright red, couldnt even tell there was cheese. . The Thin &amp; Crispy was not even close to crispy!. Terrible waste of time and money!","The overall concept is great. Authentic Italian pizza in Montreal, but sadly it needs a lot of work. The service was that of a brand new staff with minimal to no training. The wine service was some of the worst I've ever seen, (and I am no pro myself). Forgotten orders and the lack to correct situations where very apparent. . The staff needs to be retrained and needs a leader.","Good luck parking here and don't park at restaurants next door. . . you'll be towed. Interesting that with a full parking lot the place was half empty once I got in. Long wait for average pizza. . staff need training. Basically all that reminded me of The Giordano's I used to eat at on Van Buren was the sign out front. Thumbs Down. . . won't be back. I prefer Spinatos","With so many pizza options in the area, sometimes you just need to create your own. In addition to the always solid California (the one with the mounds of arugula) option, the opportunity to be a bit more creative and bring together a fantastic culinary dough-based delight at Pizza Rustica is what was in order! With their white cheese base, we added chicken, saut\u00e9ed onions, roasted eggplant, and two different types of mushrooms.","Pizza is very, very good. They use fresh ingredients and great cheese. However, there are some food handling problems - we have been there numerous times and this last time were seated near the pizza prep area where we saw servers who were handling money also handle pizza to move it from tray to serving plates and also sweeping up and handling the dustpan before resuming food service. I didn't need to see this!!!!","Hadn't heard any buzz about the place, but was looking for good local (Green Valley) Italian entr\u00e9es and pizza. Went there for Sunday dinner, only to notice that the big cavernous bar and restaurant was dead. I mean like 5 customers!  Ordered some appetizers:  garlic knots and calamari, but we're told they were out of the fried cheese stuffed with pepperoni. Surprising, since the waiter said everything was made from scratch and I knew those basic ingredients were in the kitchen. \"Scratch cooking\" was evident in how long it took for the food to come out of the kitchen!   Appetizers, which were pretty good, took 20 minutes and the chicken parm, lasagna and 3 pizzas took nearly a half hour more. . The lasagna was all right, but wasn't close to the best I've had. On the other hand, the chicken parm was excellent (tender and very good sauce). The pizzas were good, but not great. We had the meat lovers (good flavor, but soggy crust), the marguerite, (somewhat on the dry side) and the four cheese, which was too heavy on the garlic and slightly burnt. . The servers were friendly and tried to be attentive. All in all a positive experience that I would consider trying again, but if Sunday's business was any indication of future success, they may not be there for long.","Strada241 is a hidden gem in the heart of China town. It's Southern Italian ambiance and decor reminds you of a simpler time, making it a great place to unwind and relax. It offers a nice assortment of traditional Italian plates, such as pizza, pasta, salads and meat and cheese plates. The service is friendly and quick, but not pushy either. It's a great place to go on a date or with a group of friends. There's  a large, long wooden table at the end of the restaurant that can fit 8-12 people and they accept reservations.","This place is gross. I had the white flatbread pizza for lunch. Two hours later I became extremely sick and was for the next two days. Never again.","I am very, VERY disappointed in the direction Smart Gym is going in and feel compelled to update my review. . They cancelled the majority of the group fitness classes they used to have (including my 6pm spin classes on Mon &amp; Tues) in favor of new \"XGT\" classes which start at $59 a month. This is in addition to the membership fee. No other mainstream gym I know of charges extra $ to take classes. This sucks, Smart Gym. . Additionally, as of late I've noticed various CHILDREN on the cardio equipment and using the weight machines unattended. One boy on the stepmill the other day looked to be about 9 years old. WTF?? This place is crawling with tweens and freaking teenyboppers these days and I cannot figure out why. I joined an ADULT gym. I'm a paying member who should not have to wait for a 4th grader to finish up on the arc trainer. This is not acceptable. . Also, a few weeks ago they added a vending machine full of chips and unhealthy snacks and drinks at the entrance. HOW EMBARRASSING. It's like Planet Fitness having those \"pizza parties\". In modern society, we are surrounded by unhealthy food choices virtually everywhere we go, but now I have to be tempted with this crap at the damn gym? . Are you serious, Smart Gym?. I can't neglect to mention that of the three stairmasters in this gym, one of them is ALWAYS broken. Then it will be \"repaired\" and work for a few weeks only to be out of commission again a month later. JUST GET A NEW STAIRMASTER FOR CHRISSAKES!  It's the same one continually breaking! This should be a no-brainer!. And lastly, one of my favorite things about this gym was the fact that they had 60+ TV channels available on all of the cardio machines. I could do my 45-60 minutes of high intensity interval training and be happy with a nice selection of TV channels to take my mind off the misery. Well, that too has changed. A few weeks ago, channels started disappearing and being replaced with a message that says something along the lines of \"Cox is going all-digital and you need a mini-box to access this channel. \" It was only a handful of channels at first but when I went yesterday, it was EVERY CHANNEL! I was livid. So no TV service anymore here. This is literally the ONLY advantage they had over LA Fitness &amp; other mainstream gyms with a lack of entertainment options. . Needless to say, I'm no longer a member and would definitely not recommend Smart Gym to others.","Listen. Casey is on my last nerve. The taco pizza is so nasty. You can order pizza for delivery- if you are that sad of a person- but the delivery drivers are like deadbeat dads. They rarely show up when they say they will, if they do show up the are usually over an hour late, they ask for money for something stupid- like their taco pizza-yuck.","Extremely rude employees. Did not want to serve me. They were all talking huddled in a group. Unprofessional. I ask for tomato sauce and they told me to buy dipping sauce. That it was illegal to give me tomato sauce for my pizza??? What the heck!! The girl that works has such an attitude. The whole staff in this place unprofessional and extremely rude. Will not be returning and will not buy pizza pizza. I will not spend my money on poor managed franchise!","I'm partial to a good Sicilian pizza because it reminds me of my childhood. And for me, Bella Donne does it good. It may not be the best, but I like it and the staff has always been friendly when I call in my orders and pick up.  (I've never had them deliver. ). I've enjoyed their hoagies and salads as well. Nice staff, reasonable prices and location will keep me coming back.","The pizza was \"ok\", but if you're a wing lover you have to try the coal fired wings! Oddly enough they don't have sauces for the wings though? But the wing itself is meaty, smoky and delicious. Served over some bread wedges and caramelized onions. Take out wings hold up very well.","Perfect spot to grab a bite by PNC Park. Conveniently located at PNC park but with an outside entrance. We were here for a ballpark tour, really hungry and running late- Slice on Broadway just hit the spot! Very friendly service and VERY good pizza. We loved the crispy crust, no slappy pizza here! and the Supremo just had the perfect amount of toppings. We all loved our slices, hangry status was averted and we made it to our tour on time. Can't ask for more!","Love it. Nice and fresh, and the sushi pizza is delicious. And I have to appreciate that they make California rolls without avocado for my too-fussy kids!","I'm a New Yorker, so any Pizza not from NY is going to have to work pretty hard to get more than 2 stars from me. That being said, Little Nippers really shines as some of the best pizza I've had outside of NY. Their wings are also very tasty and always freshly made to order. The staff is friendly as well, and despite my infrequent visits still remembered me.","Yesterday I had tickets to the Cavs playoff game and was planning to going to mAsthead for pizza and beer. Shame on me I didn't know they are closed on Mondays. Even on home game days. We decided to go somewhere closer to the arena and knew about this newer bar on Prospect. I wasn't sure the name and as we got closer saw the sign for 811 kitchen. What great decision. We got there about 90 minutes before the game and couldn't of had a better experience. Great service, food, and easy on the wallet during happy hour. After the Cavs won went there for victory beer. The place has    A good selection of beer and booze. The menu is like an Asian fusion if I had to pick something. Serving sushi and fun kind of appetizers. Will be coming back there before and after games!","The atmosphere was great and the pizza was fantastic. We met some friends for lunch and it was a great place to eat and talk.","Absolutely wonderful! Fresh dough and ingredients. We also had the bruschetta as an appetizer delish! Fast friendly service, great atmosphere. The pizza was great, just how I like it. We will be back!","As a celiac sufferer who needs to be gluten free this place was wonderful. Their gluten free standards are quite good and I did not get sick from cross contamination which is always a win. Very quick delivery and the pizza was hot. Will be ordering again!!","Highlights/lowlights. 1) gluten free friendly*. 2) good food. 3) great atmosphere . *g free crust was supposed to arrive the next day we were there. Stopped in to Lucille on the first night they were serving their full menu! The space on the square is AWESOME. The location is great and the interior is super trendy. The huge windows can all be opened to let in fresh air. The three story space is made up of the bar and communal dining on the first floor, booths and tables on the second, the downstairs is where you can see the old bank vault from the original building! I think they do cocktails down there as well? . We expected that Lucille would be busy and they were! They will give you the wait times for the communal dining space (for us this was 10 minutes) and the private dining space (for us this was 45 mins). We opted for communal dining! The communal dining space is basically a long table and you get X amount of seats. If you really hate dining next to people, probably not for you but we thought it was fun. . We ordered some drinks at the bar while we were waiting. We found the drinks to be pretty overpriced for Madison. The HOUSE wine was around $8 and my fianc\u00e9 got a beer from One Barrel (Madison Brewery) that was around $7. $15 for a tap beer and house wine is a bit steep in Wisconsin. . Service was friendly but a little slow. Giving Lucille the benefit of the doubt as this was their first night with the full menu. I had been DYING to try their pizza as I had scoured the menu on their FB page and saw they had gluten free crust! You can do gluten free crust for the wood fired pizza but not the square Detroit style pizza. However, when I placed my order the server said they didn't have the gluten free crust in and this was expected to arrive the next day. Sad!!! While the gluten free crust gives people with celiac disease a lot of options the lack of leaves you scouring the menu. They have some salads, but since I can't seem to ever eat a healthy dinner, I decided on the large portion of the pork belly nachos! The server warned me this was big but I was up for the challenge. My fianc\u00e9 settled on the pepperoni and red onion Detroit style pizza. HOLY COW THE WAITRESS WASN'T LYING THE PORTIONS ARE HUGE. My nachos were probably enough to feed four, and my fianc\u00e9e's pizza was enough to serve two at least. This is good however considering both items were around $17/$18. The Detroit style pizza had six slices which was enough for a full meal and plenty of leftovers. It may cool in the future to see a smaller pizza size emerge on the menu. If you are there with a few people and want to try different pizzas you will have a ton of leftovers and a pretty hefty bill which could be prevented with a smaller size offering. All that aside, the food rocked. The nachos were great and being served on corn chips makes this a great g free entree or appetizer. Pizza was great too! . Lucille is an awesome addition to the downtown neighborhood. I look forward to coming back and finally getting my hands on that g free mushroom and garlic pizza!","Better late to the party than never. . These guys helped us pack our truck when we were getting to move back to Atlanta. Having everything organized and ready to go into the truck was a huge job, but getting everything into the truck without begging and bribing friends with pizza gets old -- we've moved a lot in the past 4-5 years. . The two dudes had our truck strapped down to the gills with room to spare and not a thing out of place. I was really happy with their level of consideration in where everything went and their demeanor in handling all of our boxes and items. I even gave them pizza and Powerade!. I'd hire these again in a heartbeat. Hell, with the way things go, we'll probably end up moving back to charlotte at some point in the next decade anyways. Glad to know they'll be around when that time comes.","Atmosphere:. The restaurant is an open space with hard surfaces. The hard surface net effect makes the place loud. . I was with an older woman (mid-70's) who had a very hard time hearing the conversation.    . Food:. My party was observing lent. We ordered the Egg Plant appetizer, Sweet Pepper Pizza, and the Cheese Calzone. . Each had decent flavor but nothing to take it to the next level of other wood or coal fire pizzerias I have visited. Please note that the pizza are \"well done\" which I prefer (crust must pass the stand test - ie. No floppy slices). The oils from the cheese still made my pizza soggy. . Service:. Our service was great. The waitress was very attentive and kept our refreshments filled. . Price:. Pretty Expensive - You are not at . . . Pick your Chain here. . . . Overall - I really don't think I will go out of my way to visit this place but if it is convenient or other folks want to go then I will give it another try.","Update 05/31/2018: My Son's birthday party was this past Sunday, May 27th, and I am truly in love with this facility. We've been to several different trampoline parks and by far this was has been the most accommodating and amazing experience we've had. I truly appreciate Chad, Seth, and Damon for going above and beyond in making my son's birthday party the best of all years!!! . A total of 21 kids attended my son's party with 3 hours of fun. . Even the parents loved it and want their kids' birthday party there as well. . We CANNOT thank you guys enough for your patience, selflessness, and most of all your support. The pizza provided by Get Air was delicious, and I also hope Seth and the staff liked the Mexican dish I made as well. . We will see each other very soon!","Despite all the pizza options in Las Vegas, this is by far the best tasting pizza around. We don't even mind the drive to Boulder City because the food is always great. Although, don't expect bubbly, overly friendly customer service. I sent my parents here and they weren't impressed with the service quality. The service isn't bad by any means but they're quite straightforward and monotone when taking orders over the phone and it can be a real turnoff for some but honestly, I love it. No annoying, unnecessary banter. Pizza tastes amazing and that's all that really matters.","I love this place. We just moved to Vegas and wanted to try something different. The food was really good. I had the fajita bowl, my son had the fiesta burrito, husband had four cheese pizza, daughter had the bean and cheese burrito. Super friendly staff and very clean. There was a slight mix up in our order where they forgot our daughter's burrito. They got it fixed right away and apologized profusely. I would highly recommend this place and will be back again. If you download their app you also get discounts.","This place is nothing short of amazing. Full disclosure- I've only gotten delivery service from them, but WHAT an amazing service it has been! I very much look forward to visiting their actual restaurant, but as far as delivery, it's definitely some of the best. . I've tried pretty much the entire menu, and everything that I've had has knocked my socks off. Their chicken wings are *UNIQUE*. They cook the entire wing, so be ready for a bigger piece than you're used to. Their blend of spices and sauces is amazing, and you'll find yourself smacking your lips, saying:  \"What WAS that?!?!?\". Their wings are a little on the 'wetter' side than I usually like, but that didn't detract from their flavor or meatiness at all. . I've gotten pretty much every form of meat delivered, and everything has been exceptional. Their chicken TRULY stands out though- I have NO idea what they're marinating these meats in, but it now holds a special place in my heart. Their Kabuli rice is also something special- slivers of carrot and fat raisins with a subtle sweetness that will just draw you right in. . When you're ready from a break for meats (that won't happen) you can order one of their salads- slightly vinegary with a nice cilantro flavor and a crispness that just perfectly accents all of the meat and grains in the dishes. And their dumplings. . . their dumplings are the PERFECT late-night food after a few drinks. . Tonight I ordered their naan pizza for the first time. Please don't make me repeat the word 'amazing' again. I could use more synonyms but that would be an exercise in redundancy. . Bottom line- they're doing something special here and you really owe it to yourself to check it out. Try some new things- you really won't be disappointed. And if you *ARE* disappointed, then WTF are you doing reading any of *MY* reviews?? We could never be friends.","I went here with my neighbor, Tate, who is a good friend of the owner, Joe. The place is a bare bones pizza joint and has an un-pretentious atmosphere that is hard to come by in this day and age. . Joe, his wife, and his little kid were all behind the counter working. Brandon, a regular and a mail man was at their single table taking his daily one and a half hour lunch break over a burger and fries. . I had the Italian sub and Tate had the jumbo wings and a large loaded fry. The fries came out hot and fresh and there was about 5 pounds of them, maybe more. Tate's wings were fried and covered in hot sauce. They were the whole wing, not sectioned and cut and were full of meat. . My Italian sub was baked and had a perfect amount of meat. The lettuce was fresh and not wilted and the mozzarella cheese was melted perfectly. The roll was crisp on the outside and chewy inside; perfect. . I had a great lunch shooting the shit with my neighbor and his friends as we ate good food. The kind of people that staff and eat at Fortino's are the kind of people that give you respect and appreciate your business. I'll definitely be coming back.","Super antipasto that comes with garlic bread, awesome pizza &amp; service was great. . Will definitely be eating here again when I'm working in this part of Mesa.","Very sad to see this place has closed. My nephew and I had gone in the other day, not realizing it had changed owners. Unfortunately, without Chef Polo, Dolce Vino  is like any other , run of the mill Italian take out. Nothing distinctly unique about it. The quality of food was poor and prices were high. We ordered a pizza and caprese plate. Both were tasteless. I wish the new owners the best of luck but I am on a mission to find where Chef Polo went!","With less than an hour before our show we asked our waitress if we had time for dinner. She told us what dishes could be made quickly and got us fed and on our way on time. Diavolo pizza, diavolo shrimp pasta, short rib bruschetta, poutine and raspberry beret cocktails were all super delicious!","O. k. , so this little Benny Fierro's has been in my neighborhood on the south side for quite some time and I have heard few things about their pizza. My only experience was seeing gigantic pizza boxes laying out on garbage day that said Benny Fierro's on them.  \"Home of the Virginia Slice?\"  Ummm. . . what does Virginia have to do with pizza? So, I strolled in and ordered one slice of ham and pineapple Hawaiian style. It was 5 dollars and I was expecting a rather big piece, so I did not order two. .  2nd and third visits - I went back to this place for the specialty slice and liked it on the second try. As a matter of fact I have changed my entire attitude since then. I am not sure why I didn't exactly like the first time, but I have really liked their pizza since then. It is one of my favorite places to buy pizza by the slice. It is a good balance of ingredients and it is not overly greasey, which is a pet peave of mine. The entire pie is sooo huge I don't think I would ever need that much pizza, but they are great to stop in for a quick bite. Plus they have really interesting soda's and teas I can't find anywhere else.","Went for the philly game. Loved the tv on our table. Staff was friendly. Margarita pizza was just ok. Probably wouldn't order again. Caesar salad with chicken (1/2 order--plenty of food). Chicken was dry. 2 chicken tacos, tasty but not enough salsa. 1 chicken taco 1 Carne Asada taco. Chicken was dry, Carne was so tough and chewy barely could eat. Not enough salsa. Enchilada soup was good, not great Lots of chicken, good flavor, good portion. Guacamole burger was large but over salted. Onion rings were delish. Chef needs to work on his food. Prices are reasonable. We will give them another try because it is close by. Lots of food options.","So happy we have something cool in Matthews. We frequent this place every couple weeks and love it. Great wine selection, beer is fantastic, the pizza place blows the peel across the way- away. . . and always nice people working. I bring people to try it and they love it too. Thanks for opening!","Based on the other reviews, I stopped in here during my lunch break to order a pepperoni and cheese pizza roll. The pizza roll is served in bread maybe a foot long. . For $3. 50 the food was well worth the price as it was delicious. However, having worked at a pizza place as a kid, I don't know how it took them 25 minutes to make it. . Still, despite the wait, it was well worth my time and left me very full.","One of my favorite places to go get pizza the staff is always nice and it's always quick good service. And the pizza is some of the best pizza I have had. I would definitely recommend going here if you like pizza.","If the quality of the cuisine were the only barometer in rating a restaurant, I would provide Jackson's five stars. The menu can be pricey with entrees ranging from $17 to $55. Some of the dishes include only bread. The menu is limited, but everything we ordered was delicious: wedge lettuce salad ($7), pasta bolognese ($17), and the excellent, unique bread basket, which includes one that is pizza-like. Butter should be included along with the tapenades or the diner asked if he or she wants butter with his or her bread. Grated or shredded cheese should be offered for pasta dishes. The restaurant is attractive, but it is not comfortable. Tables for two are small and one is placed a couple of inches from the next table. The noise was deafening throughout much of the evening on this busy Saturday night. This is not the place for an intimate meal as one must speak loudly to their companion in order to be heard; even then, it is difficult. Our server was pleasant, but not sufficiently attentive. Water was not refilled as needed and a quality check was performed only when we were halfway through our meals. The restaurant lacks bussers who could help. I recognize anew how much more the superb Franco's Trattoria of Peters Township offers, including a quiet, comfortable environment and Italian cuisine that is second to none and fairly priced. At Franco's I could have enjoyed a pasta dinner for $14 or a chicken parmigiana dinner for $17, both of which include a huge serving of excellent chicken pastina soup. Additionally, Franco's offers a great rendition of the Pittsburgh favorite, fried zucchini, something which is not on the menu at Jackson's.","The food is fantastic, however the online ordering is not as good. Placed order and was given a 15 minute \"ready window, \" which seemed a bit broad anyway. When I arrived, I was initially ignored, and when I was noticed, I was then told it would be another 25 minutes - which ended up being 40 minutes. This is unacceptable and will be remembered if we choose to visit again. No pizza should take more than an hour to bake - come on!. One of the managers did eventually talk to me and said she had reversed the charge and that the pizza was \"on them. \"  it will take a couple of days to reverse, but the effort was appreciated. I still am not sure how a pizza - any pizza - takes this long to prepare.","There's two sections to Boston Pizza, one that is very family oriented and the other where everyone without kids go to. . . the bar section. :) My experience is limited to the family area section of the resto. . People have to take into consideration going to Boston Pizza on a Saturday night in their family room. . . . will earn you a stay with families who'll most likely have children with them of all ages. In our case, we were a table of 12 with 4 children under 3. It was pure madness with the other tables going on but it's a family oriented area so we weren't so paranoid to annoy others. Staff properly put all the families in the same area and I did not see any adults without children anywhere in our vicinity. . I went with \"The Big Dipper\" which basically consists of a thinly sliced steak piled high on a toasted garlic-brushed bun with melted pizza mozzarella, braised onions, roasted red peppers and crispy onion straws. There's also a dip with horseradish mayo. I went with the side fries. Overall, I found my meal to be mediocre. I don't know why but it simply didn't taste all that good. . . the dip helped some but I don't think a Philly steak-like sandwich should require a dip to be half decent. The bread was off and the meat was overcooked of not of high quality. The fries were good but when I got them they were already somewhat cold. . Staff was competent and helpful. Refills of my root beer were done as if on queue and it was efficient. The food took quite some time but the place was VERY busy, so I understand the wait. It wasn't Jack Astors long but still notable enough to be mentioned. . I found Boston Pizza to be a very average experience that I may repeat in the future if we go out with a bunch of children in a family setting. . . . but I'll definitely will be trying something else. I had a slice of their meat lover's pizza and it was good, so maybe I'll try that next time!","I know I'm a pizza snob coming fron NY area but this pizza (with burrata)is outstanding!  Cooked purfectly with fresh ingredients. We tried it a few days ago and wanted it again before we left. Service great and prices reasonable. Highly recommended!","I'm a groomer myself, just do friends dogs here and there since i stopped working at a shop, Unfortunately don't have the greatest tub for bathing dogs just yet! and no dryer! yikes! i had my friend who was in desperate need of her cocker spaniel to be groomed ! and if anyone knows how much of pain it would have been to let her air dry i would have had my work cut out for me !!! so i took miss babygirl to wag n wash to clean her up after i pre-shaved her at home, the man that helped me out was great! and super nice and informative even though i told him i was groomer LOL! but I didn't mind he did great at his job! he checked in every few minutes to see if i needed anything and got me clean towels when asked. I ended up leaving with a bag of bully sticks my golden LOVES!! and a good deal on them too!! and two slices of cookie pizza SO CUTE!!! and babygirl smelled wonderful thanks guys!! DEFIANTLY WOULD RECOMMEND! . ***SHOP CATS ARE TOO ADORABLE!!!","This place is absolutely incredible. The food is amazing! I have had the best pizza of my entire life here. It was a special but it had olive oil, mushrooms, spinach, and more stuff on it. You could really taste the olive oil and it was so high quality and delicious. We went on a Tuesday night and we were seated right away but I have been on other nights and it takes a very long time. But, the food is incredible so I'm generally inclined to wait. Every waiter that I've had has been incredibly nice and helpful.","Large pizza for 5 beers for $20?! I'll be back. Pizza was good, place had a nice divey feel to it, definitely a great place to watch the panthers play this fall.","Not sure if this is a bar or restaurant . It's definitely a loud bar with food attached. So if quite dining is a must forget this place. The Omni suggested when I asked for casual Italian food . I definitely got casual. Personal size pizza was marginal at best . Wife's meal of grilled octopus was very good and worth getting again if I ever feel like getting a 17. 50 scotch Manhattan . I should know better. To qualify as an Italian restaurant. Make sure the name if the place has an Italian name at Least.","I've only had Rascal House Pizza maybe three or four times since I moved to Cleveland nearly 15 years ago, and I've never had an awful experience. I genuinely like their white pizza, which we've ordered a couple times for lunch in the past two weeks. Each time the pizza tasted different. One more garlicy than the other, but still delicioso. The delivery time was pretty decent, especially since we ordered during the major lunch rush.","What on earth was I thinking? . I know Rascal House pizza is terrible-- weird, sweet crust reminiscent of bisquick, sweet sauce, tasteless toppings. It was one of three places to eat on Euclid whilst I was taking my Bar Review at CSU (not as fun as it sounds-- bar exam review, not a review of bars). The other two were an Arby's and a scary greasy spoon. So I ended up having at Rascal House more times than I care to count. Imagine having to study for the most important test of your life AND having to eat bad pizza along with it. The horror. The horror. . I've had it since then, because downtown firms always seem to order it for working lunches. It has not improved. . So, here I am, back at CSU to take a few classes. What to have for lunch. I'm pretty sick of Subway. Nothing at the school food service looks good today. What to get? A salad. How hard can a salad be? Surely Rascal House has a simple, tasty salad. Most  pizza places do. . Swamp water. That's what it tasted like. The lettuce bore the unmistakeable taste of pre-cut, bagged lettuce that had been siting in the cooler for a while until someone opend it and dumped it into a container without washing it.  (I worked at a few dives to put myself through undergrad. I know how that works. )  The carrot shreds were completly dry and had absorbed whatever scary odors were going around the cooler. The turkey and ham were both of the ultra processed, parts-is-parts variety. there was about a tablespoon of cheese and two tiny slices of hard boiled egg. Sad. . THEN, I had to eat it whilst listening to really bad, really loud 1980s top 40. No Cure, no Depeche Mode.  1980s Hambone music. . I'm going out to find an insulated lunch bag.","I'll start with what I like. The most unique thing that I love, is their cheese and salumi. Not that I haven't seen this at a bar before but the fact that I have the option to pick and choose different ones from different regions is pretty cool. I would like to know if they actually shop around for it or get it from WSM. Their pizza was respectable. I like the craftiness and the seasoned oven. As said before not the traditional thin Neapolitan you would expect, still very flavorful. . Overall, I like the route they went and goes great for a wine bar experience. Wine selection is nice, unique cocktails, and craft brews from the bottle and draft. . My pet peeve of this place is that they have only one style of wine glass. Which is a narrower glass, I prefer a wider body for my reds. . I've only been at the bar, therefore I must say service could be better. I usually get handed a menu immediately which is good, then I'm almost forgotten about. Place my order, get my order then I'm really forgotten about. I have yet to asked how my food is. I don't get offered a second drink until they pick up plates, which at that point I'm read yet to move on to bigger and better things. . If you like a wet experience the following is for you. Be careful sitting in front of the wine taps, because when that keg blows you will get a shot to the face.  this did happen to me, the keg blew and wine got on me. He pour ended up being a half glass of bottom of the keg wine. The bartender offered me the glass, I said sure. Come to find out she charged me full price for it. The  kegged wine average wine with a huge markup. . I will agree the price are high for what you get. Which is really my only real con for why I wouldn't go there. I would love to spend more money there, I just need to have a more pleasing experience, and that every dollar is worth it, and as of now it's not. Whether the price point is better or service or something new, humble is my 'I want to relax quietly somewhere with a glass of wine' place","The pizza was just ok. I ordered double cheese. If there was double cheese I couldn't tell the difference from a regular pizza. I can't tell you if the cheese was good because there was hardly any on the pizza. Very disappointing. I'll try another place for my next pizza. I ordered the butter garlic crust. It was very good. That was really the tastiest part of the pizza. I don't get pizza for the crust.","Love the location. I meet here often with friends. Great for pleasing everyone. I usually get the Fontana burger. (Idk how they spell that) and the hubs gets the fried shrimp. I hear the pizza is good but the oven is usually closed. . Also, staff walk around with a \"salt gun\" to kill flies. GREAT idea. Love it. But a little too close to me while I was eating.  . Delish. And fun environment!","What an amazing time! Never been to Pittsburgh before and this is a hidden gem! If you can go for jazz night and grab a pizza!","I finally got to try this pizza restaurant and it was so yummy! I will forever now come here when I have my pizza cravings, they have delivery as well. Really cute decor inside ad the staff is so nice.","Family owned business that is pretty good. One of the best, if not best pizza place in Strongsville area.","My husband and i go here almost once a week the pizza  is so delicious it make us feel like we are back in new your or jersey  i absolutely  love it and their dinner dish make me feel like my mother witch is born and raised  in Italy  made them. Its a nice clean place to just relax and have a great meal the service  is wonderful  some  time    it takes a little  longer to receive  our food then other  times but from what i  Being  in there there are only two waitress and they dont work the same shift  i prefer  going when the little  blonde girl is  there the other one isn't  as friendly  and don't  provide  very good customer  service  but i do recommend  everyone  try this place at least once the new cooks and staff  are great compared  too 3 years ago","If you are looking for transitional Japanese cuisine, this is not the place. If you want to try something different, this place is highly recommend! Overall food was all very tasty and high quality but my favourite was Tuna pizza. Very flavourful and crispy.","We got takeout. Order was correct. Portabella pizza was good, but I'd probably leave the blue cheese off next time. Salad was good and more than enough for two people. They gave us a ton of breadsticks and the cannoli came with chocolate sauce and chocolate chips! I would definitely eat here again.","Had dinner at the bar. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the entire cheese selections. We were lucky to sit in front of the fiery pizza oven! Anything that can out looked so amazing, we had to order a lardo pizza. It was \"buttery\", cheesy, and just sweet enough for consumption of its entirety. Definitely will come back to order off the rest of the menu","Good place to meet some friends. We had a large group meet at Duke's to have a little holiday cheer. Service was good considering how crowded it was. The bar was overwhelmed by our group and another group. We had some pizza and wings. The pizza had a medium crust and was good. The wings were somewhat crispy and tasted good.","Great steam punk decor. Many unique combinations of food. The salmon pizza was overly salty though. Thought the music didn't match the decor. Staff was very friendly and attentive.","Petit endroit magique o\u00f9 la pizza est hallucinante. Tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s abordable et vraiment romantique.","You know what, after further review I do have to update my other review. I've eaten here 4 or 5 times now, and I have to say that the pizza here is actually awesome. . The gotham and the spicy one (I cant remember its name) are very delicious. They obviously use high quality ingredients, and have consistently made a delicious pizza every single time. The crust though. . . I never knew that crust on a pizza would make me say \"wow, this crust is so good\" at least 3 times per pizza. It's perfectly cooked/burnt to perfection sourdough. . The drinks are good, and the service is also very good. . One thing to consider before you sit down though is that they only serve certain things at the bar, and certain things at the table. So that can be a little confusing, and really the only thing I can say is maybe not great. Other than that minor detail its all good. . The pizza is really that good.","We love this place!  It's about a 10 minute walk from where we're staying this summer and we come almost everyday for delicious croissants, ice cream, breads, desserts, pizza and lasagna.  . We've become great friends with the Parisian chef and the staff. Very friendly and kind. He actually taught my wife how to make croissants. . . which was a dream come true to be taught to bake by a French chef.  . My personal favorites are the chocolate Almond croissants (a bit heavy and very sweet, but thats perfect for me) and the curry lasagna. . We had a custom fondant cake made for my son's birthday for less than $20 that he loved and was really good. . The $1 crossiants are light and buttery and my wife loves the chocolatines. . Nice comfortable atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating.","Disappointed. Getting our meals after ordering took too long and the last of seven meals came 8 minutes after the rest. . I had the calamari marinara, the sauce was NOT homemade and fresh. It was served on linguini NOT the angel hair pasta I requested. The person ordering the pizza said it was only average. The Caesar salad I had was only OK. We would not return here.","Stuffed the food was amazing! My bestie complains about everything. . . . But she loved it pizza was really good, mussles were excellent. Corn beef so juicy, and the fish was meaty, clean and crispy!!!","Just had the Rigatoni Bolognese which was the only thing I had yet to try in the 6 yrs I've been coming to this fabulous neighborhood restaurant. The Pizza and Pasta dishes are to die for. The chalkboard specials are always worth a peek. My wife's favorite pizza is the Brooklyn Bridge with meatballs and roasted peppers. The service is always friendly and the make a mean Manhattan at the bar. Louie and Marie welcome all their guests like family. Don't hesitate to make this a regular stop in North Scottsdale/Carefree/Cavecreek area.","The dinner-and-a-concert thing was getting unreal last year, but this would be our final outing of 2013. To top off our season of live experiences, we had one more Stage AE show to catch as well as stomachs to satiate beforehand according to protocol. I kept forgetting about a certain North Shore food-and-drink destination named Soho, so with them in mind, Kay, a mutual friend, and myself strolled on over after parking the car to see how they measured up. . The interiors invoke a noirish urban landscape not unlike Bruce Timm's vision of Batman's Gotham City or the city of Chester Gould's Dick Tracy with a sparsely detailed skyline acting as the focus of the dining room. Swankiness be damned, our gracious and gifted server Jess treated us like Rat Packers despite our denim-and-band-shirt attire, serving us above average food with agility, style, and congeniality. . To kick off the meal, our power trio shared a serving of Soho's Thai Shrimp. On a bed of greens and lemon wedges came an octet of plump, reddened sweet/sour prawns that dazzled our palate with their Asiatic/Oceanic blend of sugar, sting, and brine. . Offering the proverbial \"a little of everything, \" Soho also crafts a fabulous Buffalo Chicken Pizza. It was a must, and in lust I fell, deeply. . . . http://www. youtube. com/watch?v=FnI36r9sdG4. A puffy, doughy, floury, artisan-proud, stone-baked crust held moist cubes of chicken breast, a typically tart tabasco sauce, and a a gloriously glutinous blend of mozzarella and provolone. At 12 inches around, this was a magic carpet ride to pizza pie paradise. . The Caramel Turtle Bundt Cake was almost akin to a chocolate sticky bun with its adhesive, candied walnuts. A scoop of vanilla cream soothed the heat and richness of this igneous breakfast treat turned dark and inverted, lacerations of caramel amplifying the sweetness with slightly sinister salty bent. . Soho: Far from So-So.","Living in Los Angeles, but being an east coast guy, it can be trying sometimes dealing with the certifiably awful, tasteless pies Angeleno's call pizza. I wasn't expecting any different of Vegas, but upon a casino shop worker's recommendation we tried Five50 for a slice and a beer one night. We sidled on up to the bar for a late night snack. I had the forager, a white sauce, mushroom, spinach and ricotta concoction, while the wife had the simple five cheese. . Wow, good pizza. Really good pizza. No, seriously, really good pizza. So good, we came back the next night and ordered a whole cheese with whipped ricotta and wood oven fired tomatoes. Even better. Really an eclectic take on a classic east coast pizza, done wood oven style with crispy crust. They also had a good selection of pricey but tasty tap beers. . Put aside for a minute that its rather expensive for pizza , a single pie is $25 to $30, and beers run $8-$9 cocktails $14, then again everything in Vegas seems to be pricey these days, this was easily the best pie I have had in LV to date. Cost knocks it down from 5 stars, and service was spotty at times, but certainly not terrible. . Recommended if you need either a quick slice or a whole pie, a single pizza would serve 3, and is plenty for 2. Recommended!","Wish I could give this place ZEROOOO stars. . staying in a hotel and was suckered in to buying the 2 for $15. 99 pizza anyway. . . terrible choice. . . one of the pizzas has nooo chicken on it. . the ingredients and sparse. . . just an effin waste. . . ohhj and they wouldn't delivery to the room. . I had to come to the lobby to pick it up. . wish they would have told me ahead of time. .","We tried this new neighborhood place a couple nights ago. It's very plain inside &amp; there was no one to greet us or acknowledge us. We sat at a table in a nearly empty place for about 5 mins. Still no one came over. I got up, found the waiter &amp; this was a sit anywhere. He said yes. Sat back down, when he came over we told him we lived in the neighborhood &amp; it was our first time there. Ordered the pizza  it was good, had nice thick crust, the pepperoni was small round spicy pieces, cheese good. We got 1/2 square &amp; it had 12 squares. Way too much for 2 people. . We will go back one more time because they serve a Buffalo classic, beef on weck. I hope it will be a little more welcoming next time!","this is the best pizza I have had in Pittsburgh! The pepperoni pizza was prefect. we ordered the twisties as well which were amazing. The bartender was very nice and the prices were great. Definitely worth a trip to the south side!","Pizza and lasagna just showed up, 30 minutes after the delivery time they quoted (which was 45-60 minutes). Pizza is cold, might as well have been made yesterday. Salad is fine. Lasagna is ok tasting, warm-ish temperature. Garlic bread is cold. We understand Friday nights get busy for pizza places, but reflect that in your quote time. Or don't quote anything at all. And you better be damn sure you send out hot food. We could have had frozen better than this. Judging by appearance only, it's probably pretty good when it's hot and fresh but we wouldn't know that via their delivery. This was our first call, definitely won't try them again. Woman who answered the phone was rude and unhelpful when we called to check on the status of our order. Go elsewhere!","This brand new location of the rapidly expanding franchise replaces a pizzeria/bar that I haunted since I was just a smurf. So upon entry, I almost expected WW to impress me as payback for buying out C. J Gino's and one of the best pizza pies in town! Well alas and alack, I've been back to WW three times since they've opened and I haven't yet felt remunerated. . Some notes:. The wings are good (albeit not Buffalo good). . They're big, they're expensive, there's about 100 flavours, and they're breaded (blasphemy to any Buffalonian). . Their heat rating chart is out-of-whack (\"hot\" is not hot at all). . Since they have about ~100 flavours, choosing is a real pain since who knows what \"Garpar\" or \"Lock, Stock and Barrel\" actually taste like in advance? Sure there's the sampler platter, but you pay even more per wing just for the variety. . Wait staff is nice and knowledgable, even though it's a brand new location. I was pleasantly greeted by an out-of-town \"BOH Trainer\" who is a representative from Head Office who stays with the new franchise until it's up and running smoothly. Very impressive!. As of my last visit, the patio is was not licensed, so all brewskies must be chugged inside.","I got what I expected when I went to this restaurant. . . . . . above average deep dish Chicago style pizza. I really liked the atmosphere of the sports bar/pizza joint. This would be a great place to go to watch the game. All in all the food is good, but slightly overpriced in my opinion.","Went for a late bite to eat after a long day. Being new to this area,  I wanted to find a spot for a quick decent meal. It was pasta night with 15% off on a Tuesday, but I had a steak sandwich, which was done perfectly and very tender. . All the extras were piping hot, except of course the salad. Very satisfying casual meal. The waitress was friendly, and service was good. They have take out and delivery, so I may try a pizza from there one of these nights. . The atmosphere is casual &amp; comfortable. I was there during a slow time, and was pleased that the service was still prompt. A decent family restaurant which I will return to occasionally. . Went back a second time for pizza. I was not as impressed with the service. A different waitress was on shift and the atmosphere was more rowdy, which I was not in the mood for. Still, the pizza was good, and it hit the spot, once again.","The pizza here is really really bad. My boyfriend and I came with a group of 8 people. One person in our group has a gluten-free diet, and with there being such limited gluten-free options for pizza restaurants we were looking forward to trying Mark Rich's. Unfortunately, I doubt we'd ever go back. . Each person ordered a different pizza. Jayse and I shared, ordering a large cheese with tomatoes and half artichoke. The crust could best be described as a tasteless, soggy cardboard, and the toppings on each pizza were sparse. For the artichokes on ours, there was only individual artichoke leaves (no actual heart pieces) spread around the pizza very sparingly. You couldn't even taste them. The food was paired with poor service from our server, making for a very disappointing meal. We wouldn't recommend this place. There's much better pizza options here in town at similar prices.","So a friend and i ordered from here, its  been a while since i ordered pizza, so i was surprised and impressed with my experience. It was also the firdt time for me with trying new York style pizza, i was not disappointed. My fire and i got a large new York style pizza eith sausage, pepperoni,  and onion with parmesan breadsticks. Both were great, the breadsticks were good, but what stood out the most was the pizza. It wasnt greasy and the flavors were great, they all balanced each other out. I highly recommend  this place.","Totally mediocre. I went on a Saturday night, so they should have been at the top of their game. Based on reviews, I was expecting something wonderful. I had the caesar salad which was delicious except for the pretzel croutons which were too tough to chew. Then I had the shrimp risotto. Only three little shrimp! The shrimp were good but the risotto was not. It was cold and the sauce tasted like Chef Boy'rD. My friend's broccoli side order was not put in right away so it came after the meal. It was tasty but it was strange to eat it like a dessert. . There were lots of servers standing around talking to each other. They seemed bored, waiting for food to come out of the kitchen. I asked for a napkin because I didn't have one at my place setting and it took a long time to come. I should have just grabbed one from the next table.  . Anyway, I was so annoyed by the whole experience that I used my phone while we were waiting for broccoli to make a reservation at another restaurant for the next day. . The ambiance is nice, quiet enough to have a conversation. Oddly, there is a TV in the dining area but not in the bar. . Maybe the pizza would have been better. I saw some at another table and it looked good. But with so many restaurants in Vegas, you can do better.","We went here today for lunch. The food was average. We had a Bruschetta appetizer and a medium deep dish Pizza, and while the Bruschetta was very flavorful, their Pizza lacked any flavor at all in their sauce. I broke it down and tried each item separate. The cheese was good, the sausage was good, the black olives were good, the pepperoni was 'eh', but the sauce was very bland. It took 45 minutes for our pizza, but luckily we had our Bruschetta to help pass the time. I did have to get up, walk to the back of the restaurant, and ask for silverware and refills on our drinks, so the service was not so good either. I think we will go somewhere else next time. When I reached out to Giordanos, it took 2 weeks for them to get back to me. My Wife and I chose not to return, because of the way we were treated. Fletcher and his team should visit Oregano's or Babbo's to learn how to run a restaurant, because I doubt if they have a clue.","Will never order from here again! Their medium pizza is the size of a Dijorno but w thin crust! Totally overpriced and not worth the money! I'm from NY, and we eat real pizza w real sized slices!!!  The website pics are a farce. Went there only bc it was recommended by a friend. Won't listen to her ever again!","My daughter celebrated her 8th birthday party here. . We got our own private room, pizza, drinks, , and we were able to bring our own cake. . Our host was Keilani and she made sure everything was organized perfectly. Your two hour party pack includes jump time for all the children with a private dodgeball game and then cake and gift time in the private room. They even clean everything up for you no big mess for you to clean up! They have a rock climbing wall as well which is pretty neat when they reach the top they can ring a bell, this was my daughters mission but she was unable to make it, maybe someday soon! The kids absolutely enjoyed being here and we plan to come back for jump time in the future. Thank you Rockin Jump and Keilani for an awesome experience!","Unconventional Flavors on Conventional Oven Crust = Amazing Pizza!!!!. This place is delicious!  Super fresh ingredients!  The salads are loaded and are bursting with farm fresh flavors!  The herbs in it burst with flavor. These are some really fresh salads. I didn't get the caprese, but next time I have to. Someone next to me ordered it and it looked incredible!. This area around here is starting to become a real fun place. It's air conditioned and cool, but has a unique look and feel to it. This place is located in a really cool spot. You can also sit outside, so the choice is yours!  . There is a brewery right next to it, you'd almost think it was the same place. Luckily it kind of is, you can sit over there and drink a brew!  If you don't drink they also have bottled sodas (the goods ones!). They have an arcade emulator if you want to throw down with some fighting games (including some streetfighter classics)!. Fire and Brimstone is also BYOB and has no corking fee!!!  So you could go pick up a bottle of wine at the winery next door, or bring something else. Just don't bring open bottles. I have a feeling this area may soon be overrun with Hipsters, but what can you do?. So now what you probably came for: the pizza. The crust is wood-fired perfection!  The crust is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It does no bend when you pick it up. They have some conventional choices like pepperoni, cheese, margherita, but the daily specials and build your own allow for some unique creations.  . When I lived in Germany, a lot of people there loved corn on their Pizza, which they do here. Today's special was a lamb and feta pizza!  They even allow you to put an egg on top (weird here, but in Italy and Europe is normal). The Fire and Brimstone pizza is great!  It's like a really good meat chili on a pizza, not very spicy though so anyone will enjoy it. All the toppings were super fresh and some meats made in house.  . If you like some great crust and amazing topping you really need to try this out. I recommend coming on the weekend early and spending a few hours walking around. The Coffee place next door has some great desserts, so you can stop in there. Or just come to booze it up and eat some pizza!","Super friendly service and the food was so quick out of the kitchen. Loved the Adore Salad and our pizzas - so good! Will be back soon for sure.","We love this place. Great for the young boy to find friends and run around before, during and after our food. . The kids choices are not as great as I would want. Full size grown up food is always amazing. . The grilled bbq pizza is good but it is hit or miss on how burnt the bottom is. :(. The farm is a treat. We spend more time on dinner when we are here. Life slows down for us a little. . Get a malted vinilla shake. Sooooo worth it. . Garlic fries/green beans are overloaded with garlicky goodness. Can you tell I am hungry as I type this? . A bit pricy to eat often for us. But we are never disappointed.","I went to dinner here for the first time because I heard great things about this place. After dining here, I realize people go here for the ambience not the food. It's a nice little locally owned pub/cafe. The service was excellent and our waitress was very nice and pleasant. The food on the other hand was extremely overpriced, contained small portions and lacked flavor in general. The food wasn't bad mind you but it just lacked flavor and that special umph to make you want to return. It certainly didn't warrant its prices. Im not cheap. I'm more than happy to pay over a $100 a meal if the food is worth it but when you get Cheesecake factory quality food that is prices 3 times that amount, . . . well you get the picture. I ordered fish and chips and the fish contained two small fried hallibut chunks. My wife ordered one of the pizzas. The waitress came back and said they didn't have dough ready and that they could make it on \"french bread\". They ended serving my wife brucheta with melted mozzarela. Yes, it was pathetic. We complained to the waitress and they did nothing to take the item off the bill. My wife and I decided not to make an issue of it because we will likely go back there to have a drink and relax as it has a nice environment but we will clearly not order dinner there as it extremely lackluster. The duck tasted moist but unseasoned. The key lime pie was too tart and had a strange aftertaste. The Asian-Cuban appetizer was one egg roll split in half with some beef on the side. I don't know what they were going for there.  . Again, this restaurant is designed to be an upscale hangout for the local Ahwautukee and Chandler 40-50 crowd as opposed to offering great cuisine. I wouldn't go here with the interest of dining. I do want to emphasize the \"hang-out\" factor. Imagine if your mom and dad decided to dress up and hang out with other couples at a bar. That's honestly, the reason a lot of people like this place. Imagine Cafe Boa with bad food and you get 56 East. The only reason it doesn't receive two stars is the service was great and the ambience was nice. The food was weak. If you do eat here, order just 2 appetizers and have drinks. Don't order any of their dinner items as you will pay too much for lousy food.","Very good service, cool restaurant and sitting outside in the misters to cool off was great. The pizza, of course, was a wonderful reminder of home (though I still prefer Lou Malnati). I also had the chopped salad which was very tasty. And on a side note, the faucets/hand dryers in the bathroom were kinda cool.","Apparently I had a different experience here than Jason L. But I suppose they had a few months to clean up their act.  . I met up with a few friends, and S of N were having a two for one special on all menu pizzas. We got two larges, and they were fantastic. Yes, it was a tad greasy. . . but its New York pizza and that is how it is suppose to be. We also got the BBQ wings, which were great. . My only negative is that it took a bit long. But, with two-for-one pizza I imagine they were getting pretty slammed in the kitchen. I will be back, even with the new Native NewYorker down the street opening soon.","Great atmosphere and good food. . Kinda pricey for a casual place. $13-17 for a pizza. Same prices for entrees as Tomasso's. . Will go back for HH only. . Central Bistro across the street has comparable or lower prices and an amazing HH.","Came to this place completely by accident. We meant to go somewhere else and saw this place and decided it was too neat looking so we had to give it a try. . The 4 star rating is heavily based on the food. The actual condition of the restaurant is more like 3 stars. It has nice ambiance but if you start looking too closely, you'll notice it is very deteriorated. Perhaps, why they dimmed the lights so much! :p. The food was delicious. All except for the bread, weirdly enough. It wasn't warm or fresh and was served with butter packets, not oil. Oh well. We ordered the goat cheese bruschetta and one of their pizzas. Can't remember which, but it was pesto based, not sauce. I loved it. The dough was doughy, not crispy. For dessert, we had a mildly spicy carrot cake (which also had goat cheese! Yum!) My husband and I split all 3 items and it was enough for dinner and leftovers to bring home.","Decor is modern and attractive. Our server was very attentive. Where we found Giulietta fell short was the food. This is not elevated cooking but basic Italian. Both the pizza and pasta dishes were bland and lacked flavour. Pizzeria Libretto has better pizza and Terroni, more flavourful pasta. When we gave it the \"would you go back\" test, each person in our party proclaimed No.","Best pizza I've had so far while living in Phoenix. I had the deep dish but they make thin crust as well. . Clean restaurant with a friendly staff that is knowledgeable about the menu. . Lots of variety on the menu and a great beer selection including local brands.","Last week was my first visit to to the California Pizza Kitchen and I have to say, I really enjoyed it. It was a great place to grab dinner. The pizza was a perfect size for two, with mild appetites, to share. The outside seating was nice, and although service was a bit slow, the waiter was very friendly. I will say that I was never offered a refill on my drink, which was a bit disappointing. The traditional pizza was great. I really like the flaky crust. I feel like it has been bake with olive oil or something - it is much better than other pizza crusts that you would find at a \"take out\" place. For dessert, I went against the recommended butter cake/ice cream and went with the red velvet cake. It was fantastic.","Dinner 7/14 Ordered the shaved pork belly  for starters. Highly recommended. Then went with the Gotham Pizza. Pick off the sausage first then devoured the pizza. Solid meal. Like anything in Vegas it's overpriced but you can't go wrong. Good selection of draft beers as well. I'd go with the Ballast Point, Calico Amber. The service was stellar as well.","My wife and I went here expecting good things. The reviews on yelp were high. We walked in the front door and the bar tender and the manager just stare at us like, \"what do you want?\"  We were confused--trying to to figure out if we were supposed to seat ourselves or be seated. Finally a waitress tells us we can sit wherever we want. We sit outside and are given menus and water. As we are looking over the menu the aroma from the herb and tea house next door  becomes stronger and stronger. We decide to move inside--no problem. Our waitress was friendly and suggested the calamari or eggplant appetizer--we go with the fried calamari. The calamari comes back in a timely matter and looks ok. We tasted it and it was disgusting. I've never had calamari fried this way. . . it was fried in the same type of manner as fried chicken and it had a dirty oil taste. The fried part was light and crispy but the after taste was like burnt oil. We told the waitress and swapped it out for the grilled calamari. The grilled was definitely better but very chewy. The only good thing about it was the sauce. . I ordered the margarita pizza and my wife ordered the chicken panini. My pizza was pretty good. The center of the pizza was pretty soggy but the sauce and cheese were a 6 or 7 out of 10--I'll take it. My wife took one bite of her panini and thought it was gross. I thought she was over reacting so I tried a bite. It wasn't good at all--the chicken was dry, the bread too hard, and the broccolini bitter (which the owner said is how it's supposed to be).  . At this point we were really disappointed. It's one of the worst feelings going into a restaurant hungry and looking forward to a nice meal and being disappointed and leaving hungry. . The owner took the panini and fried calamari off the ticket and apologized. The apology didn't seem very heart felt--seemed more annoyed. Some people have had good experiences here but I will never go back. If you do go--don't get the calamari or the chicken panini--and expect the pizza's crust to be soggy in the middle.","I love there steaks here, for me it's either here or smugglers, pizza is great, love doing a prime rib and pizza dinner. Always take my friends from out of town here","Chain-like food in a chain-like setting. The pizzas are ok, but not outstanding. The burgers are pretty good (but not blow-you-away good), the beers are pretty good (but not the best you can get in Champaign -- go to the Blind Pig or Triptych for those), the service is always friendly and chipper. But definitely adequate for a casual bite with friends. Their signature beer battered bacon should be tried once, and then quickly forgotten (it's amazing in that way that you hate to love it). My major complaint is that they over-salt things -- salads are too salty, fries are too salty, etc.","Hands down the best burgers I have ever had. The Fontina Burger is to die for and even the fries are fantastic. The pizzas are fresh, crisp and very flavorful. The Fried Green Beans are also a favorite of mine, but only indulge if you have unconditionally loving friends and family around because it will give you garlic breath that could take the paint off of walls. My husband likes the more traditional Farm Burger, Jumbo Fried Shrimp and Onion Rings. You really can't go wrong with anything you get here. The food is high quality, fantastic flavor, giant portions and the prices are great! My husband and I frequented this place on a weekly basis while we lived in the area for 2 years. Do yourself a favor and eat here.","I have been eager to check out the Brewery Market event that's been happening at the Wynchwood Barns on select Sundays (1pm - 5pm) over the summer - http://brewerymarket. com/.  . Each Sunday features a different microbrewery and their beers. The feature beers on this particular Sunday were from IndieAle House, which is a new brew pub set to open soon in the Junction area. . By the time we arrived around 2:30pm, they only had the porter left so we grabbed a few of those to try. The beers come in 12 oz. plastic cups and cost $5 each or $7 for glass mug that can be kept as a souvenir . We also got a personal sized pizza to share ($8). It's grilled in an oven on the premises so it was hot and fresh. . The Brewery Market is cash only and beer/food tickets can be purchased from a small desk by the entrance. We checked out the event space, greenhouse and surrounding garden areas to see what was growing. The area around the Barns features a nice grassy lawn, a off-leash dog park and a big playground with a splash pad. Very family friendly indeed. . Free street parking is readily available on the residential streets. Just make sure to have a designated driver if sampling a lot of beer. . The Barns and the Brewery Market makes for a fun day trip on a Sunday afternoon. I have heard that the Farmers Market on Saturdays is also worth checking out.","Had the Sonoran Dog. Came here just for it. Bottom line is the bun was delicious and toppings all fresh and good. The dog itself was ok. A Nathan or Sabretti in that bun with the fresh toppings would have been great. Located in the SE corner of 83rd and Indian School behind the pizza place.","Well I asked for extra cook time on my wings, and seems like I got laughed at when told her mother the order, then they placed my pizza with my friends pizza which was very unacceptable; because I don't eat pork for one! Then they both had the nerve to tell me my pizza didn't touch hers. First of all how do you know if we came in the same car???? Plus who does that without asking???? And she ordered hot wings which looked like my soggy ass mild wings. No wonder why the place is  dead!  Stumpy's off Northern and 12th St has great  Pizza!!!!","Came here on Valentine's day as I wanted to try a nice italian restaurant. At first, it seems like we we're entering a basement but once we got inside it was beautifully decorated. Great customer service and very nice waiter who made sure everything was to our liking. They served us garlic bread upon arrival. We ordered a lasagna and all-dressed pizza. Food was tasty. Reasonably priced. We would definitely come back.","I've ordered from them on several occasions and their customer service is always spot on!  Deliveries have always been on time and most importantly the food arrives hot. This is some of the best pizza in town and is always my go to. I recently dinned in the restaurant for the first time and just like the delivery, everything was fantastic. Customer service is polite and enjoyable and they make you feel right at home. They took great care of us and, as always, the pizza was great!  . I'd recommend mushrooms &amp; jalape\u00f1os or pepperoni &amp; banana peppers and a slice of cheesecake to finish it off.","A family owned business, everything is made to order. Great pizzas, sandwiches, wings, fingers, appetizers, a kids menu, calzones, strombolis, anytime specials and Lunch specials. Call ahead of time for a pick up or a delivery. You can use the Yelp ordering system called Eat24 and your food will be ready for you when you arrive. . Help a family business grow, remember how Mama' used to cook? You can't go wrong here. Tell your kids, they like pizzas, a large cheese slice for $2. 00, yes $2. 00!. www, superpizzanv. com  702-565-1600  Arroyo Grande and Sunset.","I absolutely love this pizza place. They have a couple of locations throughout the valley but the location is my favorite. The staff is very nice and helpful. . This location has indoor and outdoor seating areas. . Great for kids since its s casual atmosphere. . The pizza is amazing and the best. The don't have boneless wings so that kinda sucks but the regular wings are good. The pizza can be a bit greasy for me so I just blot it with napkins. Most people wouldn't mind but for those out there that are like me just a heads up.","We ate here after a long day at Carowinds with our 2 young boys. Judging by the name of the place, we expected a casual tavern, but when we walked in we felt a bit underdressed. We sat anyways and since they brought out some kid menus and crayons, all seemed fine. I'm glad we stayed!!. I loved the ambience and food. Would love to come back for a date night. I ate the sirloin flatbread with goat cheese and balsamic reduction and it was amazing! The flavor combo was so unique. The sweet potato French fries were also the best I've ever had. My spinach salad was also good. My drink Carolina on the Beach was excellent. Our boys split a kids pizza and my fries and had plenty to eat.","Looking for a local spot that's not going to break your pockets and has some great food? Look no further. When I'm home and just want a beer or a piece of pizza. I always come to Empire. You will go in and you can sit at the bar, in the dinning room or on the patio. You will definitely meet some locals and have some good laughs. This time i ordered a philly Cheese stake and some fries. Make sure u get some buffalo sauce on the side. Food came out hot and the waitress was on point. Overall a good experience and like always I'll be back! The food is good and even better service. It can get crowded at times but it's a damn restaurant, and is worth the wait!","We ordered the gigantic 28\" half Maui Waui half pepperoni  and had to try the the cannoli too so we got a caramel cannoli and a strawberry one. Holy pizza for days! It was delicious! Just the right amount of chewiness and crispness to the crust and plenty of cheese! The cannoli were crispy and sweet deliciousness as well. Only reason it gets 4 stars is that I couldn't fit the left overs in the fridge! Lol! I guess next time we just need more people to help us eat it! Great value too!","They always do a good job. We had an issue one time where our \"extra cheese pizza\" really didn't have extra cheese. They gave us credit for our next visit. I appreciated that.","My girlfriend had told me how great this place was, so we gave it a try. We ordered a deep dish cheese  pizza and a greek salad. . The pizza was phenomenal. Tasty crust, ample cheese, delicious sauce. . The salad was the disappointment. After my girlfriend talking for months about this being her favorite salad, it was a mess. I give points for it being fresh, but there were barely any toppings. The pepperinchi were banana peppers, there was very little feta, etc. . We ordered late so I'm hoping they were just out of ingredients.","Great place! The pizza's are amazing. . Crystal was our waitress and she was awesome, very attentive and came by our table often to check on us. .","Totally decent NY style pizza. I think Secret Pizza at Cosmo has a better white pie, but the service and kicking beats are definitely better here.","I've been a big fan of the original Windy City Beef N Dogs location on Lake Mead since its first week. I'm thrilled to welcome a second location and as an added bonus it's even closer to home. The new space is next to Boodles Lounge. They'll be keeping later hours than the original location, hours are 11am-9pm daily, but they intend to keep the grill going as long as there are hungry folks to feed. It has the potential to be great late night grub. . No matter the hour, the food is just as well done as it is over on Lake Mead. Italian beef and Chicago dogs are still top notch, and they've added additional menu items like the gyro, corned beef ruben, and pizza puff combo. . Now, with two locations a taste of Chicago is easier than ever to be had.","We went there for lunch on a Wednesday. The lunch menu is fabulous. The service was great. The pizza was delicious. My husband had the pizza on the lunch menu and it was a good size. The crust was thin and the mozzerella was fresh. Just delicious!! I had the Honey Hot wings and they were pretty good. The wings weren't saturated with sauce so that was nice and it had a nice bite to it. The total bill for 3 people for lunch was $25. 00 before tip. We will be going back!!","Really average pizza in a fancy setup. The crust was not crisp enough, instead we had a limp crust which was weighed down by too much cheese. The spicy pizza had hatch chili peppers on it. . . And the garlic bread was so oily, it seemed to be fried instead of baked. The tomato sauce was great though.","I've been getting subs and pizzas here for years and they never disappoint me. We usually do their pizza on Monday nites for their $9. 99 specialty pizzas. They're . Alfredo Chicken is superb! If you want. a change of pass, Bellacino's is excellent!","Wanted to get a steak or veal sandwich and nope!  California Sandwiches was closed!  QQF! (equiv of WTF in french). After flipping out the yelp app, we ended up at Oregano's. Been in this mall a lot. . . they have the Ontario Service Centre here, but never ventured into the restaurant. . Sunday morning, 1PM. . . hungry with no place to go. Sounds like we're having Italian!. We were the only ones there. Not a busy time - the wood burning pizza oven was not even lit. Nonetheless, I wanted a sandwich and nothing is going to stop me. . . well almost nothing. . The clan settled on a Veal Cutlet sandwich, a Chicken Parm with Penne, and a Steak Sandwich. Told you I was going to get my sandwich!  Kind of good cause it was a great deal!. $8. 95 for any sandwich with the soup of the day. My steak sandwich was $8. 95 already - so soup's on!. . Them!  Yay!. The tomato soup with wild rice and mushroom was pretty good, the bread they gave us was toasted with garlic butter-ish stuff. . . not so good. . The chicken parm was bigger than the 5oz and the bed of penne was super large. Oh. . . speaking of large. . . the sandwiches were humongous!  After the soup, it was hard to have all that food. It was basically two meals as we took half of the servings home. . Not sure what it was but the sandwiches were missing something or maybe the buns were old (they were toasted and buttered). It was not all that enjoyable. . Is it worth a second trip. Yeah. . . next time, I think we will go when the place is hopping busy.","My wife and I were visiting Phoenix and this place is just across the corner from Hotel San Carlos. We were looking inside when one the the owners literally opened the door and welcomed us in. Although we only had a pizza and salad, they treated us like family. We will definitely visit again.","I love the tgin crust pizza. Founders favorite is really good and so is the pepperoni","Good service but I'm rating it with a one star because the food was not very good, especially for the price $$. For appetizers I ordered some sausages, cold in the middle, they brought me another order of them but they just weren't good, very dry. And I got fried zucchini, no Bueno either. For my entree I got chicken parm which wasn't bad but like I said too $$, you could go to Olive Garden and be more satisfied. Oh! their bread was good so the pizza may be on point but I didn't try?","We decided to head to Naked Pizza on a Friday night and found the location to be in a strip mall. We soon found that the restaurant wasn't really a restaurant but more of a storefront where you placed and picked up your order, with the exception of several small tables just outside the door. Upon entering the location was open and bright with their menu posted largely on the wall. Basically you choose the size of the pizza, crust thickness, choice of sauce, choice of cheese. and additional toppings. As with most pizza places there are \"specialty\" pizzas to choose from too. . Within 15 minutes of ordering our pizzas were ready and we chowed down. I definitely noticed a difference versus regular ol' pizza in the crust alone. The ancestral blend was definitely grainy in texture and different than what I was used to. With that being said, it was pretty darn delicious. As always, when vegan cheese is an option I'm pretty happy about it. . I think Naked Pizza could grow in many ways if a few ideas were considered. Have a more spacious area for dine-in eating and provided plates and utensils for those interested in dining in. We literally had to eat out of our boxes since no plates were provided.","New York pizza, this is not! Where the crust wasn't soggy, it was tough and rubbery. Add that to canned mushrooms and frozen spinach (at least it tasted like frozen) and you've got one disappointing calzone. My husband, raised on New York-style pizza, was not impressed either. The only reason I'm not giving it only one star is because I was able to eat it.","I've been walking past this place for the last couple of weeks, trying to figure out when it would finally open so I could give it a go. I live next door so it is a very convenient location to fill my pizza cravings. . Tonight was opening night apparently, and it was pretty slow. They had a lot of bored looking employees pacing about. I was even asked if I worked here by staff. . Cool joint. Apparently its a franchise that started in Italy with locations all over the world. This is the first one in Canada. The chairs are made of recycled clothing or something funky. I sat at the bar and just shot the shit with the bartender and and off duty hostess, both of whom made some solid recommendations. The atmosphere was pretty chill and one of the owners greeted me and thanked me for coming. . I went with the Diavola pizza (mozarella and spicy salami) off of the recommendation from the bartender. It was tops. The mozarella was perfect, the salami just spicy enough to give you that unf, and the thin crust crisped the way I like it. The pizza came out lightning fast, like uncomfortably so. Like, I got my beer, was getting ready to take off my coat, and the pizza arrived, piping hot and fresh. . Pizza's are anywhere between $10-20 and are all 12 inch in size. I crushed mine and probably could have ate another one since it was so tasty. They also have appetizers and pasta. Apparently they have all you can eat gnocchi on the 29th of every month. I can't imagine that's healthy for you but the gnocchi did look and smell delicious. . They also appeared to make some killer looking drinks which I'll have to come back to try, especially their varieties of caipirinhas. Not Italian, I know, but they damn sure looked good. As the saying goes. . . I'll be back.","Here to watch the Oddball Comedy Fest with Amy Schumer, Aziz Ansari and 8 other comedians. The show provided lots of good laughs (4stars for that). . I was going to give this 2 stars, but really that was for the \"draining experience\" for attending a popular show on the last day of CNE!!  If you are mentally prepared for the crowds, it's tolerable!  I personally do not need to experience it again. The entire experience left me drained. . . crowds lining up getting into the amphitheatre, crowds in the amphitheater, crowds getting out of the amphitheater, crowds leaving the CNE grounds (we took the streetcar). . However, this is a review about the venue, so I give it  3 stars.  . Learned some really important lessons from this visit that I'd like to share below.   . 1) Good thing we got row 100 seats (ground level seats / non VIP) so was allowed to enter through the VIP entrance (did not know prior to purchasing tickets). The queues for all the back rows were humongous!  I would not have had patience to go through that. . 2) The tickets say the show starts at 5. 15pm but when you got there, the main acts do not start until 7. 10pm!  (The gates open at 4pm. ). There were some side acts that started at 5. 20pm but it was standing room only and so so so crowded you could hardly move or even see. And honestly, people were waiting for the main acts. . 3) Once you pass the gates, there is NO RE-ENTRY!!!   If we knew that, we would not have trapped ourselves with the 1000s of others inside the premise to be subjected to limited fast food &amp; expensive drink choices. Would've definitely ate at a restaurant before entering. . With 2 hours to bypass time, we stood in line for what we thought was the best food option:  Rancho Relaco gourmet (Mexican) food truck. There was only one other truck:  an ice cream one. Unlike other reviewers mentioning more truck options. The Amphitheatre had their own concession stands like pizza pizza, foot hotdogs, chicken tenders, beer/drinks . . . . etc. Rancho Relaxo was ok, it took us 45 min. to wait in line to get our burritos. The order taker was really awesome and friendly but we weren't really here for the food. Was forced in a way to try it because of the situation. Perhaps we will try their restaurant location if we are ever at College/Spadina. . 4) purchase you tickets from credible sources. Eg. Ticketmaster. . Finally when the gates opened, we were led to our seats and someone was already sitting there with exact seat numbers on their tickets!!  They said they purchased their tickets from kijiji from someone who couldn't attend the show. We purchased ours from ticketmaster. We had the venue management look into it and the other couple got led out by security because we think they got scammed by someone selling fake tickets!!","Here is the story;. We took our son and his family to the movie Point Break. . Movie and seating was great. We ordered pizza and it sucked. It was cold, chewy and soggy. . When the movie was over my wife went over and told the counter person about our experience with the food and that we were very unhappy about the food. As we were leaving and standing outside the doors the \"On duty manager\" Jared, tracked us down outside and listened to our complaint. He apologized repeatedly and went back in and not only refunded our money spent on the food but gave us a gift card for the amount we spent on the movie. . The company that owns this business needs to know that their manager Jared truely knows the meaning of \"customer service\" and went out of his way to find us and completely make our evening unforgetable. . We will be back.","This is now our go to pizza place. I love the pizza, fresh veggies and authentic flavor like you would find on Murray Hill. My son loves the wings and cheese steak sub, the ladies that run the place are super friendly. Nice to see a family business among all of the chains in Strongsville.","Great pizza. Bar staff was exceptional (don't remember his name but he's a surfer). Happy hour prices are good. Will go back!","Well the service was average. The atmosphere was kind of confusing. It was as if the place didn't have an identity. They wanted to be classy, but they sold pizza. It was also too wide open, like a college hangout. Waaay too expensive for college students. I didn't particularly care about the burnt crust on the pizza either. The pics in the restrooms, waaay too raunchy for kids!","I really like this concept and their food. Normally you can get in and our of there quickly during lunch but lately the service seems to have gone downhill. I normally order a salad they have been taking forever. I love that they make your salad to order but when there are 5 people in line ahead of you, it can take awhile.  this is my only complaint.  other than the service, great place for lunch. you can order pizzas, pastas,  sand, and salads. . all very good","Went here for lunch with a friend last week. Agree that parking is kind of nightmare. . . however, once inside, the spacious wooden bar and well-trod wood floors felt warm and welcoming. We had the Green Goat pizza. The crust was a little burnt, but it was tasty nonetheless. I was still hungry a while later, so I had a cup of the clam chowder: very tasty, but a bit thin. I also had cheese curds. These were heavenly. The best I've had in Madison. Even the Ranch dressing was good, and I find Ranch usually repellent. . CONS: The wi-fi didn't work, and I needed it for the business I was there to conduct. . I felt like I was inconveniencing them when asking questions about the menu. . Hey, nobody is on all the time, eh? That's cool. . Lastly: I saw that they have clams and oysters on the menu, so I will definitely be back. Another Green Goat is also in my future. And one of those tequila drinks with jalapenos in it.","This is typical southern- New York style pizza, and I don't mean Staten Island. I mean it is what they think New York style pizza is south of the Mason-Dixie line. . With that said it isn't bad, but if you close your eyes you aren't going to think you are in Brooklyn.","Hazelnuts on the green beans. . Pistachios on the pizza. . Some sort of delicious seed-thing (anise? coriander? i should know but i don't cook. it was yum) on the olives. . And caramel on the chocolate chip cookie/vanilla ice cream dessert thing. . Combine this with that amazing glass of Argentinian white I had and you've got a pretty tasty treat. . Humble Pie made a pretty inventive, attractive, tasty meal, and they didn't brag about it or anything. . I'd totally go back.","Very good food! I work in Lincoln Square Mall and it's nice to see good places to eat or shop at joing the Lincoln Square Mall, I have lunch there often and the pizza is great! The Chorizo stuffed Mushrooms are to die for! The space is large so it would be a fun place to host a get together at. I would recommend their pizza to anyone!","The pizza is okay, not the best. Their wings are not good. They also took too long to deliver.","Been coming here for years and it is simply the best! Amazing homemade pasta and pizza and wonderful staff. Family owned :)","If there was less then one star that's what this place would get. . . . It's horrible don't waste your time or money!! Ordered the white pizza its was very very salty. We each had one piece and tossed the rest. Jalape\u00f1o were okay we ate those. Then we got a slice of tiramisu it was frozen! And got the balalaika and it was stale. It was the worse meal I have ever bought!! I will say the delivery drive was very nice. 40$ not well spent!!","We ordered some takeout on a Saturday night. We tried pizza and a meatball sub, and both were great. We mistakenly ordered four Arancini for a family of five, but they are HUGE!  Very tasty, but we should have ordered two instead. Highly recommend this place.","I have heard a lot of people knock this place but I don't know why. The pizza is excellent, the toppings are of very good quality and the cheese is outstanding. Try their green olives on a pizza, not something I would order anywhere else but from here it is delicious. The fried mac n' cheese sounds nasty but its surprisingly good. Best pizza in Madison.","This restaurant is a great, fun place to eat when staying at the Venetian. If you have a choice, definitely go for breakfast over dinner, as the food is significantly better. . My girlfriends and I had a great time eating here, as it is outside and right by the pool so it is a very relaxing atmosphere with really good service as well. Breakfast was delish, but lunch was mediocre. I ordered a pizza that left something to be desired. . Overall, this place is a great, relaxing place to eat when you want to chat with friends or family and eat some good food.","Terrible service, just terrible. Every time. Isn't the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results? Shame on me. . Most recently, I called Pizza Hut because I'm avoiding Papa Johns for political reasons. They told me that they needed to \"confirm that I had given them the correct telephone number. \"  First of all, in this day and age, what business doesn't have caller ID!?!  In any event, I confirmed that, in fact, she had my correct phone number. Astonishingly, she said she needed to call me back to \"further confirm. \"  As if that's not idiotic enough to require two phone calls to order a pizza, she told me, \"if I don't call you back in 5 minutes, you need to call us back or else we'll cancel your order. \"  Yeah, um, okay. I'm going to sit by my phone with bated breath for five minutes, and if you don't call back, I'm going to call you back. So I can have the privilege of eating your semi-disgusting, totally unhealthy pizza. No thank you. You can go ahead and just cancel it right now. I'm pretty sick of Domino's, but I've had far better service from them. . Oh, and by the way. . . if you order online to avoid the ridonkulousness, the estimated time is merely \"an estimate\" that you need to call and confirm with the store. And so if their online \"estimate\" is, say, 45 minutes off, well that's your problem, buddy.","my husband and I along with a couple of friends ate here on Saturday night. It was the first time for me and the hubby eating here. We arrived early and had some time to kill. We walked the property and the nearby housing development. . The food was great! My husband ordered one of the pizzas, which was big enough for one person or for two with small appetites to share. I ordered the farm burger with bleu cheese and a side of fried zucchini. The zucchini was pretty fresh tasting which is nice when you are used to prepackaged frozen stuff. . I was a little apprehensive about eating outdoors because you are in a farming area with lots of bugs and I did see a sign near a tree that said to beware of falling scorpions. Yikes!! I was pretty much on the look out for bugs the entire time. . I would love to go here for breakfast sometime as they have some really tasty sounding dishes. . The food is a bit on the pricey side, but it is good. . I would assume this place is packed  most of the time, but on this night there was plenty of seating. . Be sure to check out the bathroom. On this particular night and perhaps everytime they were showing \"Thunderbirds are Go\" on the tv.","My husband and I went to Windsor last Saturday at around 4pm. Have been there before and enjoyed. This time was only a 2 out of 5 and that is my husband who is usually happy with his meal. . He ordered the porkwich sandwich. he said it had no flavor. I ordered the Berkeley Veggie Burger. It was the worst excuse for a veggie burger. I always will go toward a homemade veggie burger. This had no flavor other than a mushy texture served almost cold  on almost raw kale. What is going on?Service was poor at best. Not only to our table but the table next to us had to get up and grab his waitress to get ketchup. . We used to love Upward Projects Restaurants. Seems like something is amiss. Last time we went to Federal Pizza the manager took my pizza off the bill without my saying a word. Reason they put raw broccolini as a topping on my pizza. I didn't put that evening in Yelp. I just thought it was a fluke. But twice???. I am glad they have a thriving business and wish them well. Just might need to hire more of a staff to accommodate the business.","The Bread Company is one of my favorite restaurants, and is one of the things I miss most about U of I. I ate here frequently as a student and as an alumna I make sure to stop in every time I return to campus. The atmosphere of the restaurant makes me feel like I'm taken away from the stress of every day life. They have a fireplace in the corner and white lights strung up to make it feel romantic, but it is modernized with the art that they have on the walls. My husband and I usually share an order of cheese fondue and a gourmet pizza. The Bread Company offers a nice selection of wine and beer, including wine by the carafe. I can't forget to mention their selection of fresh baked cookies. The sables and chocolate macaroons are delicious. Great atmosphere, delicious food, and reasonable prices - I love this place!","Anyone that knows real pizza will agree that this place serves the best Napolitan pizza in Montreal. The dough and crust is simply spectacular.","I have eaten here several times and normally it's not to bad this time around I got food my order was all wrong . . I ordered boneless wings and got traditional wings that were undercooked pretty badly and they forgot my ranch(which is minor) . . . The pizza however was very good. . . It was a late night order but that doesn't mean the quality should go down hill. . . basically it was 40 dollars down the drain!","Definitely one of the better hole-in-the-wall pizza places in that part of town. I used to stop by there all time the on the way to the train station. . The slices have always been a little bit more expensive than other places, but the size of the slice and the taste usually trumps it. . Also, the sesame seeds on the crust are a nice touch.","I took my 2 sons there on July 18 2015. I am a pizza snob being from Brooklyn, there pizza and crust was very good. Service was top notch.","I'll be kind and give them 2 stars for timely delivery and service. Other than that, the food was flatter than Roseanne Barr singing The National Anthem. . R&amp;B's describes itself as \"The Best Pizza Place In Pittsburgh. \" . I think not. . If a doughy pizza severely lacking in flavor is \"the best, \" I'm moving. Thankfully, we have much better pizza parlors around these parts, so consider R&amp;B's tagline a grave misnomer. . The Ranchero Steak Hoagie had soggy french fries (check the bread too), Steakumm's-grade meat, cheese, and some ranch dressing to keep it from being an utter failure. . Curiosity can kill the appetite. Thankfully I have more than 9 culinary lives. Meow.","This place is amazing. Like others have pointed out you start with picking a crust and then you can put whatever you want on your pizza for one low cost of ten dollars. The GLUTEN FREE pizza is the best. I like it better then the regular crust. The owners are fantastic and even when they messed up my gluten free pizza twice, the suporvisor Bri handled the situation with ease. I seriously respect her and the business. I will be back and I think everyone should go here. I wish they had one on ASU's campus. It would be so nice to grab a personalized pizza. . All in all LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!","I have eaten here 2 times since moving to the area a little over a month ago. I have yet to be disappointed. So far I have had the cheese ravioli and the pizza and I wasn't let down. The pizza is even good cold, which I am pretty picky about. My only complaint is the price. It's a little steep for pizza.","I'm giving this place and extra star because the arugula salad was delicious. However, the pizza was the blandest pizza I've ever had. I have never salted a pizza to try to add flavor before but I did it here! Due to the blandness of the pizza, the extremely slow waiter (no sense of urgency what-so-ever!) and the high prices it drags this down to 2 stars. I won't return. There are much better places to eat in Vegas.","We were very excited to try this place! Unfortunately, we were stuck here for upwards of 3 hours and the staff seemed to really be struggling. After being seated we waited 20 mins before our drink orders were taken. Once we were finally able to order our food our waiter insisted on simply memorizing everyone's orders (6 people at the table). Several minutes later, another waitress came out to confirm our orders as she was having difficulty deciphering what they were (they were illegibly scribbled on a piece of paper). We then waited an hour for our pizzas to come out only to find that one of the pizzas had a random ingredient added to it that had not been requested. These deep dish pizzas take 45 mins to cook so we weren't about to send it back and have another made. All of our pizzas were room temperature. . The manager was kind enough to come out, apologize to us, and offer a discount. We never complained about the service so I'm guessing she simply noticed that we had been sitting there for an obscene amount of time and felt bad. . When it came time to split our checks, our waiter took nearly 25 mins printing, re-printing, and swapping around receipts at the cash register. At this point we were all exhausted and just wanted to get out of there!. Overall, all of the staff were very friendly and apologetic. I would not visit this place again. In my opinion, it was too expensive, the food itself was mediocre, and I just don't want to ever risk being trapped there for 3 hours again.","The pizza is by far one of the best in the city and some of the best I've had period. However, as a regular customer (though it's soon to be former), the delivery takes anywhere from an hour and fifteen minutes to an hour and a half and by then the pizza is lukewarm and has to be thrown in the oven. . There's a million other pizza places in Bloomfield.","They often say the key to good food is keeping it simple and make it with love. Well I will talk to you of such a place and it's called Taglio Di Roma!  For starters you order first at the counter by choosing your pizza and there is a lot of choice. Once you choose and get your drinks and pay they reheat your pizza and bring it to your table. The dough is amazing, light and has these air bubbles that are so crisp. Now when you add quality ingredients to the mix that's where the magic happens. Over all nice look to the restaurant, clean lots of helpful staff but their secret weapon is the great food. By far one of my top pizza places around. To taste it, is to adopt it, and then you will know what I'm talking about. Compliments to the chef and staff you have a winner in your hands! See you soon!","The BESTEST freshest pizza Ive ever had!!! The dough is so soft! Plenty of meat toppings! Be patient, they make everything as soon as u order, nothing frozen or fake. GREAT service &amp; the owner is super nice &amp; easy to talk to! Cozy setting for a date or family outing. LOVE it here!!!","STAY AWAY!!!!!  Absolutely atrocious pizza and wings!!  We went there for my daughter's 5th birthday (luckily they don't' know any better. . . )  I would NEVER visit this dump again. Service was mediocre at best, the pizza sauce tasted like it had sugar in it, the dough was gross, the cheese was barely melted. Now let's get to the wings. . . . it really isn't hard to make them. You put them in the deep fryer take them out and toss them in sauce. I ordered garlic/parm. I got melted parmesan in a butter soup. No taste of garlic. Fast forward. . . . . . all of us had to run to the restroom several times after eating here and I'm still feeling it today. I will spare the details. . . . I have never been so irritated with a restaurant before. STAY AWAY!!!!","Great wings of all kinds. Cooked well. Service is great, salads are fresh. Lots of food for the money. Delivery team is frendly--and the delivery to 1/2 of Robinson Township!!!!!  Hoagies are good, although we've yet to try some of their more ambitious sandwiches. . Not health food by any stretch of the imagination, but if you are jones'in for a wing, this is the place. . Give it a try instead of pizza next time--you will enjoy.","We had a great experience here. The waitress was on it! We had a group of 7 and sat in the couch area to watch the basketball game. They put the game we wanted to watch on all tvs for us. Happy hour prices were cheap, food was good but not great and we ordered every item on it. The Margarita pizza was the best. They had a great 80's band too, super fun place.","This is my favorite pizza. The pizza takes time to cook. Don't expect to come right in and eat. Oh man, is it worth the wait.","Staff was nice and the pizza came out very quickly. Sauce was OK and everything seemed very fresh. The crust is a hand tossed thin crust New York pizza(the original is in New York). With all that said it was good but nothing crazy great. I would eat here again with no complaints but I don't think I would ever crave it. I had a meatball, mushroom pie. The 2 star rating is not meant to be a dig but I just didn't think it was anything special. I can't believe this is really the best pizza in New York as they claim.","Loved the happy hour here!! With 4 glasses of wine and a pizza between my friend and I, we got out the door paying about $40! That's super cheap for Vegas! . The design of the restaurant was super cool and chic, we sat at a loungy, low couch with a super cool lava-rock coffee table. . Wine was delish, and the pizza (sausage, red peppers, olive oil base) was good-sized and wonderful. . Service was prompt and attentive. This is a great place for dinner or a light happy hour snack.","The worst pizza I've had in a long time. Worse than Delissio. I came here because I was starving and honestly, I should have just gone home. Had to wait for 25 minutes anyway. . Had a chance to see some of their other creations being made, and it's not pretty. This is one of those places that are rare in other large Canadian cities but still exist in Montreal, where the food is actually BAD. Like, below reasonable standards of quality. . Conclusion: never again.","I live in Boulder City and wanted to take my grandson for pizza. The help was not friendly and the pizza was mushy and undercooked. We asked for it to be cooked a little longer and they acted put out. Will not return. Love Vinny's.","First, the owner is not customer friendly, she did not seem to care at all. Second, the prices are outrageous, $3. 10 for a donut and $4. 50 for a pizza bun which were good but nothing exceptional. . . Not impress at all. . . Will not go back. . .","I was about 3 miles into my run, and had this tug for pizza. Sure, I could run in and out of the nearest Pizza Pizza and call it a day, but the sincere struggle was in resolving whether or not it was going to be worth the 3 miles I had just run. I decided I'd be more intentional about my search for a good pizza. About 0. 5 miles later, I found myself at Levetto. Feeling a bit self conscious about dining in with sweat dripping down my face (and looking pretty rough, might I add), I had come to terms with ordering for take-out. . I'll start by saying, I really appreciate the casual atmosphere of this place. The reality is, there aren't enough establishments that are able to offer a good specialty menu without serving up a pretentious vibe, no matter how cool or casual they are meaning to be. Sometimes people want to eat a fancy pizza without the full dine-in experience. I like that I could order my food, pay upfront and have the option to dine in or not. In fact, did end up dining in-- after all, who cares if I look a little rough??. I ordered the Peking Duck Pizza, and this WAS worth it. . A really good balance in textures and flavors-- savory and sweet. The fresh cucumbers and green onions worked perfectly to offset the richness of the duck. The crispy crust really brought everything together. . I will definitely be back to try the other flavors!","Ordered a pizza online. . . original pan pizza with stuffed crust. What was delivered was not what we were expecting. Called and spoke with the manager Mike who proceeded to argue with us. . . no apologies, no offers of a credit. We won't be ordering from them again.","I love this place. It's not the best pizza in the world but it's definitely on my top favorites in Phoenix. My favorite days are Wednesday's here, half off bottles off wine. Can't beat 14$ for a nice Chianti. Antipasto and pizza is a great meal for us to enjoy over a bottle of wine. I'll definitely keep coming back, especially on Wednesdays. Always good service which is very important to me along with the food. Only negative is. . . I wish they had cannoli's ;)","I know that few people resort to Yelp reviews before ordering pizza, let alone from major chains like Dominos, but after repeated shortcuts I cant help but rant a little. . Every time I order the cheesy bread, instead of being 8 slices of bread ready for dipping, it is uncut and I need to cut it myself. I know this shouldn't be a dealbreaker but seriously, 3 of 3 times uncut? Ridiculous!. Also because when you order a large pizza its cut into 8 slices, I once asked for it to be cut into 10 slices instead to help with portioning, but sure enough, still only 8 slices and a completely uncut cheesey bread. . The pizza is is fine in taste and when you order online at least there are no surprises with the price when it shows up, but sometimes its the little things that can turn one away.","I am a long time and very picky New Yorker who knows good food. I was in town for a few days and was looking for a good local place that had reliable salads and maybe a good pizza. Thanks to Yelp, we were directed to Sapori D\"Italia. Coming from New York City, and having spent a good bit of time in Italy, we were delighted to find Gasper and his wife's place in Fountain Hill. We knew right away, watching Gasper make the focaccia, that he was  an authentic Italian talent - from Sicily,  via NYC. The homemade mozzarella was terrific, and the Margherita pizza was simple, light, and flavorful. The crust was delicious - wood fired with a fresh pizza dough made with flour imported from Italy and nice and thin. Add homemade fresh mozzarella and fresh basil and tomato sauce and you have a classic pizza. Best of all, we enjoyed an endless Happy Hour deal with Barbera at $4. 00/glass. Probably the best wine for the glass deal I\"ve ever experienced in the US. (You can get deals like this in Italy. )","My favorite pizza in Vegas. I always order the Mediterranean Salad add salami. Its always crisp, fresh ingredients &amp; delicious vinaigrette dressing. A glass of Napa Cellars Chardonnay perfectly chilled. And a large meatball, ricotta, sundried tomato topped with fresh basil pizza so I always have leftovers to go. Absolutely, devine.","this place has been super trendy and is always packed since it opened, I decided to finally try and see what the hype was about. . . I honestly wasn't too impressed. One of the first things we witnesses while sitting down was the manager going to a group of people and telling them they had to change tables because the one they picked was reserved. . . despite the restaurant being almost empty. We got an entree of calamari and fried shrimp, the calamari was pretty good but the shrimp was very average. I had the 4 cheese pizza bianca, and while it was tasty it was SOAKED in oil. Like so much oil that the plate was yellow. I have had much better, especially for the price.","First impression is that this place is very clean but a little confusing- you walk in and see a buffet-type set up, but it's not being utilized and looks like there's a lot of junk around the kitchen area. I was immediately greeted and handed a menu, which has American breakfast specialties on the front, and inside is a small kabob selection, naan pizzas, and burgers. Very odd combination of offerings. . Ordered the chicken kabob platter to go, and was offered a breaded chicken wing to sample while I waited- they are trying out new menu items. The wing was huge and mostly composed of breading, which is not what I'm looking for at all when I'm ordering wings. Flavor was okay, but the wing itself was just weird. . Got home with my food in a reasonable amount of time and it was nice and hot- the kabobs were delicious, and my BF snagged a few bites even after devouring his sandwich. The rice in particular was very good: I'm not one to rave about rice, but it was moist and flavorful, and had some white, some yellow, and some orange in it- likely a combination of white and saffron rice, with additional seasonings. The naan and salad were also fresh, and the portion was generous, and on par with the $10 total. Best part of the meal was the cilantro sauce for the kabobs- it was killer. Highly recommend, get it on anything.","Ordered some pizza through Uber eats. Fast and friendly service. The pizza was really delicious!","There are different classes of pizza in this world, barf pizza, bad pizza, meh pizza, good pizza, and oh-my-god-I'm-in-love pizza. Oregano's has pizza better than oh-my-god-I'm-in-love pizza. The sheer amount of amazing that they put into their pizza blows me away. Granted this style of pizza is not for everyone, if you don't like New York or Chicago style pizza (thin crust or deep pan with a tiny bit of spice to both) turn away now. For those who like this kind of pizza, this is the best (that I've encountered) of its kind. The taste of their pizza entirely makes up for any wait that might occur (depending on how busy they are). Their skillet cookies are better then any other I've ever had. As soon as it hits the table my entire family digs in and it's gone in a flash, we all love it (try not to burn your tongue on the heat of the freshly baked cookie). Did I  mention it has ice cream on top of it? My only real complaints with the place is the overwhelming loudness of the music and the long wait for both seating and food. Otherwise this is one of the best restaurants I've been to","A good sports bar. Good food, reasonably priced, with your typical beer menu. . Great staff. . . very friendly. . Lots of TV's, and well placed. . The Smokey burger, fish and chips, and wings are good. I'm not a fan of the pizza, but only because of the choice in sauce. . . the crust is good, as are the toppings. . We often will catch a hockey or Jay game here. . Recommend checking it out.","Ma solution de rechange quand je ne veux pas sortir dehors pour aller manger. Le bistro se situe \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur d'un pavillon de l'UQAM. . Le service est rapide, et sympathique. Le serveur Alex est mon favori il est vraiment sweet. Pour le menu, c'est un menu bistro : soupe \u00e0 l'oignon gratin\u00e9e, salades, menus du jour, sandwiches, paninis, pizza, poutine etc. La bouffe est vraiment ordinaire \u00e0 mon avis, mais c'est mieux que n'importe quelle caf\u00e9t\u00e9ria. . Les prix sont raisonnables surtout lorsqu'on prend le sp\u00e9cial du midi. Le bar est assez complet et ils ont des sp\u00e9ciaux tous les jours. . Aussi, il y a un comptoir pour emporter pour les plus press\u00e9s, les sandwich sont bons et rassasiants !","Can never go wrong with a reasonably priced large pepperoni pizza. Fast service and never had any issues with them.","I really love this place. It's super consistent and solid Pizza. We used to live around the corner from this joint and it was our go to. It's unfortunate that they've started to charge for egg on top of the Pizza, but after trying every pizza on the menu both of our favorites are the Saucisses Italens Douces with added garlic and an egg. The pesto sauce on top is the perfect addition. We've also had their cesar salad and a cheese fondant dish in the past, and both are delicious. The place is fairly prices for a dine-in napolitan pizza. Compared to most italien pizza joints outside of little Italy, no. 900 is definitely my favorite and my go-to!","Doesn't get better than this. Service is usually amazing, haven't had many issues with the staff, if any. . Their deep dish is to die for! Usually I'm not a thin crust gal but even their thin crust is great!. Cheesy garlic bread is an amazing starter! The \"KaBoom Dip\" wasn't impressive. . Their \"original pizza cookie\" (aka pizookie) is the best around. BJ's has NOTHING on this desert. The cookie dough is lightly baked so it feels like you're eating raw cookie dough and ice cream. . Biggest plus? AMAZING PRICES!","Terrible pizza. I can buy a better pizza at HT.  Staff is very unfriendly. I don't see why this has so many stars. Nasty is the word to describe the unsavory taste. I would rather drive 15 miles to Wolfmans Pizza.","This place has great pizza. I remember coming here after getting out at St Joe's and getting a large pepperoni and Sausage. Eight years later I still get the same pizza. The one important thing to remember is to bring cash. The staff and the owner are all very personal employees. Definitely going to be placing an order today as soon as they open.","Canada Drive-in is always a must stop when visiting family in Chateauguay. This place has been around for as long as I can remember, and is your one stop shop for Quebec's delicious fast food offerings. . From the unbelieveable pizza (puts all Ontario pizza offerings to shame), to the smoked meat sandwiches, to the legendary Canada Drive-In special hot submarine sandwich, and to the ever so classic poutine, these guys do it right. The best fast food you can ever dream of. If only this could be brought over the border to Toronto. . . . See you next time!","I held a position for 5+ years that consisted of constant travel. I covered US &amp; Canada. The US division for the company was based in Jersey, so I spent a lot of time on the East Coast. I've had the privilege of tasting many of the best pizzas that the US had to offer. This is the Second Best Pizza I've ever had! Nothing even comes close outside of Connecticut or NewYork. A true Italian style pizza in Fountain Hills! Great family style service as well. How lucky are we. . .","Value lunch deal. . .  the slices are huge. . Ate here today with a friend. Pretty cheap pizza slice with two toppings. . . I've eaten at pizza places that have cost 2x as much that left me hungry. . . this wasn't one of them. . Definitely would go back. . There are only a few tables, so not a great place for a group to dine in. The size of pizzas though would be great for carryout/delivery.","Before a Suns game recently, my Family and I stopped into Blue Hound for some drinks and appetizers. We attempted to go to Arrogant Butcher (been there many times), but it was packed. Having heard good things from another family member, we decided to give Blue Hound a try, and I'm glad we did. The inside decor is trendy and simple. We sat at the couch by the door (since that was what was available) and were quite comfortable - except for the occasional draft from the door. Our waitress was ok, she wasn't entirely too friendly, but she took care of our needs. . As for the food, we ordered pretty much all the appetizers. The biggest highlight was the scones with bacon jam. In fact, it was so good, it's inspired me to make these two things at home to see if I can replicate it. We also had the popcorn, which was good and the sliders, which were alright. The pizza with duck was great (could have been crisper) as was the other items we had. . Based on the previous reviews it seems this place, being new, might be hit or miss. I'd say give it a try if you're in the area. . . why not? Trust me, it's worth a visit for the cheddar scallion scones with bacon jam!","Not the best pizza I've ever had by far. Very greasy! Wings were decent enough but those are pretty hard to mess up. I ordered there motz sticks and they brought me cheesy bread sticks instead. My son had the ravioli and he liked it, but it was cold when it was delivered so we had to reheat it. Took an hour to be delivered, and their location is only 3miles from my house. With so many other pizza places around, I will not be a return customer.","The pizza is amazing. I love the deep dish stuff. Don't ever tell me how many calories - but the stuff is amazing. . Tried their salads and those were good too. Typically, I say that most restaurants do one thing really well - however, they do many.","This is my pizza place. I eat here at least twice a month. The prices are great and the pizza slices are giant. I get the plain cheese pizza and am happy eating just one slice. I ordered the entire pizza once and it was great too, however, I expected it to be as large as the slice of pizza, but it was not. I still go there a lot because it is so easy to eat there. Pull up, generally a spot in front of the door, despite being busy, walk in, order. The staff is always friendly and inviting. The pizza order does not take long and there is plenty of room to sit. But I generally like to take my slice home. . They recently changed their name due to not being confused with other pizza joints with the same name. That does not change a thing for me. I am a fan and I cannot see anyone not liking this place. Well, unless you do not like their thin crust. But that can be solved by ordering the thick-style pizza crust. . In addition to pizza, this place has also desserts, sandwiches, pasta and other things. I tried their wings once at a party and they were great! This place also delivers! I cannot stop raving about this place.","It never fails, I am always impressed by Wolfgang Puck's restaurants and Lupo doesn't disappoint. . It was by far some of the best italian food I've tasted in the U. S. The pizza was awesome. The cheese he used was so good. I didn't want to stop eating. The spaghetti was delicious. It had just the right amount of spices and flavor. . Prices were reasonable (for Vegas), particularly for the spectacular food we ate. Service was okay. Our waitress went missing for a while, despite the fact we told her we needed to leave at a certain time to get to a show. . Bottom line is: you cannot go wrong with Lupo. Delicious! I want to go back now.","This place has stiff competition as there is a good pizza joint right around the corner and then some other spots nearby that serve good pies. . We called in before hand on a Sunday to make sure they are open. . We went for a Margherita and Lana (White Pizza). Also added a bit of the greens on the Margherita. I ordered a glass of Cabernet for good measures. . The pizza took its time but the service is top notch. . On to the main . The Crust is not overly thin nor is it New York Style. The sauce on the Margherita was decent and hits most of the right notes. I would say one of the better pizzas around this area. . A great addition to the pizza scene that's heating up this city. . 4 Stars.","Awesome oven brick pizza! I can't believe this was my first time here, I'm glad I decided to give it a shot. So we went in and unfortunately they were out of meatballs (which was a bummer) so I decided to order a pepperoni pizza instead, SO GLAD I DID. The best thing about it was that at the end of my meal I went up to the register to pay the difference between the spaghetti and the pizza and they told me it was on them and apologized for the inconvenience. I love a place with great customer service. I will definitely be back.","Really nice folks. Made my pizza fresh and ready. Btw, this pizza taste so good pre-heated (if you can't finish it in one sitting). Street parking can be a hassle as you have to pay to park on murray. But if you can find a spot on one of the side streets, chances are youre okay. Btw, crazy mocha is close by so you can get a fresh coffee while you wait for your pizza. Near major bus route too!","Horrible service. Rude people on the phone. Delivered the wrong pizza. Still tipped the driver $5 on a $15 pizza. Quoted 45-1hr. Got here in 1. 5 hours. Did not apologize. Did not deliver to the elevator even when they asked my tower and room number. Made me come to the valet. Bad experience. . Lost the phone number for the best 24 hour pizza on the strip so if someone could recommend something, hollaaa at yo girl. . And since I should talk about food. . . pizza tastes like the pizza they give you in elementary school. Cheese = rubber. Good thing: they gave me some cheese and pepper. Cool. . *edit: some properties don't allow for the delivery guy to come up. They could've told me this.","Strange place. . . Rocking club like music with a pretty big Italian menu. We ordered the pizzas which were just ok.","Hell yeah!  This place is legit!  Ordered a two topping LG with a dozen wings for 22 bucks. Their hand tossed crust game is strong; fluffy and soft but good outside crunch. Sauce is sweet and zesty. Sausage has good fennely flavor. I was so pleasantly surprised by how much cheese was on the thing!  Most places are pretty skimpy with that stuff, it being the most expensive food item they have. I am a connoisseur of pizza and wings my friends, so trust what Im telling you. They are neck and neck with Nellos (pizza-wise) as far as flavor but surpass them pricewise. I will NEVER order Domino's, pizza hut or papa john's again. Their wings are pretty good. They could use a brining, but they are cooked very well (fried of course) and the skin comes out taut and crisp. None of that soggy fatty ball skin textured shit that you can't eat and have to throw away even though it is potentially the best part of the wing! . *note: always order your wing sauce on the side to retain maximum crispness. . Bravo!  It's so hard not to eat the other half of the pizza right now!","We order our pizza from here often on Fridays. It's far and away the best pizza in the Annex and the dough is so good. We love to get the Donna peppa and margheurita. Also they always have very fast service and very friendly owners !!","Julio was our server last night for an impromptu meeting and dinner. Calamari great, kale salad great, put four pizzas were perfectly cooked and delicious!","Had dinner here last night and was very impressed. The atmosphere was very cool and even though they were quite busy, everyone was nice and the service was great. The husband and I shared oysters which were great (the pepper mignonette was delicious) and the cauliflower antipasti which was not great. The cauliflower had waaaaaayyyyyyyy too much vinegar on it. Both of us had pizzas for our meal. Mine was the vegan sausage and mozzarella pizza and he had the real sausage pizza. Both of us loved them. Excellent crust and taste. Very good wine list and decent beer list for a wine bar. Their cocktails are delicious. I need to spend more time in Lakewood.","Amazing!  You create a pizza like you would create your sub at subway. However, unlike subway where your stuck with the meats on that sub and each sub has its own price, here you choose what ever you want and it is one price. The toppings are awesome and plentiful, dont be shy, ask for what ever you want. The pie is large (11 inches) so it is easily shared or you will have leftovers. The quality is there, the price is great, and the service is amazing. Great job and great concept. They have very tasty gluten free crust!","I've ordered twice for pickup. Both times my food was ready and great! I've had the Greek pizza and the Manhattan Special 8 topping calzone. They were both excellent, I will be going back.","The name and the concept do not go together. Red, White and Brews = American gastropub. Right? Wrong. Predominantly Italian fare. . Place was packed with a 40 minute wait on a Friday night in late July. All staff were super polite and attentive. Clean throughout. . Portions were large and priced fairly. Not a lot of beers to select from given the name of the place. Shhhhh. Don't tell the owner the beers are priced lower than pretty much every place that serves beer!. Only one burger on the menu. Cooked perfectly. . Complimentary garlic bread was yummy. . Coconut shrimp were jumbo. Cooked well. And tasty. Sweet potato fries coated in flour before frying only so-so. Chicken barley soup was a meal in itself. . Creme brulee was big and well prepared. Flourless chocolate cake was excellent though the strawberry puree it was floating in tasted off. . Next trip we're going for the brick oven pizza. Of all the entrees we could see, the pizza looked the best. . This is a great place to take a family. Even young kids. . Glad I looked passed the name and gave the place a shot. Quite happy.","Nice place to eat. Wasn't amazing or anything, but I liked their pizza. Got a 12 inch pie for just 10 bucks and the bread dough they use for the pizza was quite tasty. Good stuff, wouldn't mind eating there again :)","We ate here after buying a Groupon-. It included two appetizers two entr\u00e9es and a dessert.  . We started off with calamari and the mozzarella salad- both were very good and I'm Italian and lives in New York City and it was quite good. . The mushroom pasta with tagliatelle was also excellent and the pasta was fresh.  . The white pizza was well-made cook well and covered with a ruler and it also was good.  . The service was a little slow but the waitress was very helpful- and she did have other tables. . One very loud group of eight or 10 people with children. Very loud very obnoxious and they caused us to pack up our meal and leave early. We wanted to have quite a conversation but that wasn't going to happen. . I looked at the wine list and they had a few good wines at reasonable cost.  . I would recommend going if you get a discount or Groupon. -. However be warned in advance this is more pizzeria than Italian restaurant. There was zero selection of chicken there was no source of protein on the menu at all it was all carbohydrates or pasta or pizza.  . That being said if you enjoy eating a lot of white flour with good sauces on it you will enjoy your meal here.","The delivery guy took 20 minutes to find my address and he missed part of my order, pizza was cold","This was the first time for this location. The location I go to most often has a history of bad service. I'm happy to say that this location did not follow suit.  . We went on a saturday evening. . . no wait to sit outside, was told 20-25 mins for indoor. . . . indoor only turned out to be 10-15. Everyone was friendly, service was good, and the food was very good. . . . and at a fair price. . They serve traditional Italian dishes, a few Oreganos originals, and have awesome thin crust pizza!  They sport a full bar, so you can have your favorite beer, mixed drink, or wine to wash it all down. . All in all, a nice evening out to dinner.","Had my baby girl's birthday here and it was great. We were assigned a server and she was super attentive. Anything we needed, she was there. Wish I would've caught her name. The pizza is actually pretty good and they have Mich Ultra on tap. Dare I say I caught a good buzz there. Worth taking a look for your next kids party.","So first off I am extremely picky about my pizza, and this place nailed it. I was up in mesa for a motorcycle meet up, and the locals recommend this place, so we took off down the road. We got here and it was almost like a bar vibe, with the self seating and walking up to order. I told my local friend to get what she thought was good. She got some kind of meat pizza with pepperoni, sausage, ham and something else I believe. All I can say is it was amazing. I had to stop myself from eating more, but its hell to ride a bike so full. The service took a while even though they were not busy, but worth the wait. All in all, I recommend this place if your in town, so good!","I guess I should've yelped before dining here :-/ . . . Pro's:  atmosphere, friendly staff &amp; location in the linq. . Cons: the worst chicken parm ever. . A $24 entree I had to add salt and pepper to  (probably why they have shakers on the table); oh and don't send incorrect order back, they'll just add what they need to and send the EXACT SAME PLATE back out to you. .  . If you sit inside, facing the tv's during early afternoon hours you can see in the tv the reflection from the kitchen. . . That's how I saw my daughters pizza go back for some pepperoni and just come right back out to the table. . . Smh. Oh but if you're eating here the calamari was delish and the steak sandwich was good!  Too bad the cons I experienced will keep me far away from here.","Amelio's has reopened as Amelia's and my life is complete! When asked what my favourite casual restaurant/meal is, the answer is, hands down, Amelia's. To the person who posted that this was possibly the best pizza in all of the province, I'd like to offer that it is probably the best on the continent. The pizza is the best, period. It's served hot (and that isn't as obvious as it sounds), the vegetables are fresh, and the side salad is crisp, with a tangy vinaigrette. If you opt for the subs, the vegetarian sub is chock full of fresh fare, not the stock green peppers and lettuce but rather eggplant and zucchini. As for their tomato sauce, I'm sure it's illegal. Whatever the secret ingredient is, it's kept me loyal since I discovered the place (as Amelio's) in 1994. Only caveat: I wish they were open on Sundays and Mondays! They don't take plastic, but there's a cash machine on the premises. They also serve Dr. Pepper in a can. . . the only way to drink soda! I wish I could give Amelia's SIX stars!","Good pizza for the south. Thin crust and good cheese. Quick delivery to our hotel. Decent price. Will order again.","This place is a hidden gem. Had the stuffed pizza, and it was extremely flavorful and delicious. Definitely will be ordering again when up in WI.","Service was great. Friendly and fast. Did not think it was crowded like some thought but we did come  at 5pm. The meatballs are really good and have to agree with most here a must. Garlic bread was also good. So get the staples for sure. . My wife had the Penne with vodka sauce and added some changes, she loved it. I went with the pizza Quattro Stagioni. Good but if you love super thin cracker style cruse this is not it. A bit thicker than I like. So it gets a 3 but for service and friendly people it's a 5.","Is this a joke? Am I being punked?! This tastes NOTHING like Chicago deep dish. It literally tastes like Di Giorno's frozen pizza. Maybe that's why it takes so long to cook, they have to go fetch it from the grocery store. The garlic parmesan fries took forever to come out as an appetizer and when it did, they were limp and soggy, sad and uninspired. Parking is ridiculous as well. Service was ok, a little overbearing for my taste. What a waste of a palate. Scratch this one off my list!","Amazing pizza and HALAL options too! Yes halal pepperoni pizza!! Truly the best I've had in town. Wings are great too. Owners are nice and clean place.","No complaints. The service was perfect. Two college kids with great attitudes and friendly service. They walked us through how it worked and even cleaned off our area while we sat and talked. . The decor was modern and very hip. Not a huge fan of the graffiti but it gives it individual sense of style. The pizza place really stands out I comparison to any resteraunt I've been to due to it's system and decorum. . Lots of toppings and because they have such a hot fiery oven it can heat up numerous toppings . . Items looked fresh and up to code no wilted veggies and the spinach is put into olive oil? . Also had a steak and blue salad. Just right amount of balsamic and cheese. Great portions for 20 dollars I was so full and ready for a nap. . First place I've been to in Scottsdale that really impressed me.","Love the pizza and the dish Christopher's Pasta is delicious ! Really cool atmosphere inside very nice place and good service. Ashame I just found out about this place been missing out!","Definitely a place to check out! Our server Trent was always attentive and did well making sure we were always taken care of. They're only five days old but the staff is already killing it. I had the nachos and the mozzarella and basil wood-fired pizza. Both were delicious. The drinks are mostly rum based, which is not a problem with me. The hotel nacional is a must have! Overall I'm extremely excited to experience more of the drinks, food, atmosphere &amp; fun that this place has to offer.","Workers are very friendly every time I've come in and the pizza is absolutely amazing would highly recommend this hidden gem to everyone.","Here's what I learned from my journey to Sal's:. 1. When your husband commits to meeting his cousin for dinner who is in town for business, get an address of where he is staying before looking for restaurants, because when your husband says Glendale, he really means Avondale. . 2. Expect that many of the area restaurants close at 8 pm. Sal's was the welcome exception. . 3. Do not, I repeat, do not follow GPS from Scottsdale, unless you like a half dozen unnecessary freeway changes. Why the hell did I need to get on I-17 or State Rt 143?. 4. Skip all the research and just go to Sal's. Who doesn't like a good wood-fired pizza?. 5. Order Sal's Special Pizza. . . pepperoni, sausage, peppers, onions, and mushrooms. Something for everyone. . 6. Do not stuff as much pizza in as humanly possible, as they will box up the leftovers. Skip my advice, and it's a long ride back to Scottsdale. . If I lived in the area, Sal's would be a go-to spot for me!","The waiter was great, he brought us garlic knots at no cost for the kids! The pizza was really good an I'm from NY!","O bom deste lugar \u00e9 que voc\u00ea pode montar sua pr\u00f3pria pizza, e eles t\u00eam muita op\u00e7\u00f5es boas. Eu amei!","To be honest, my boyfriend and I were trying to get into Lady Marmalade, but the line up was just too long for brunch. We walked by this place enroute to Bonjour Brioche to check out the line up there and were quite intrigued by the menu. The place was busy with lots of holiday parties going on and we thought  \"why not?\" . We were greeted immediately by a really tall host, who we later found out was pulling triple duties as a server and the bartender as well. . The atmosphere was friendly, however very loud. We realized it was because the music was way too loud, which caused everyone to have to yell over each other and the music to hear themselves. . Service was great despite there being only 2 people (including the host/bartender). . We order a pizza, meatballs and a kale salad. . I can't remember which pizza we ordered, but I believe it had spicy sausage on it. It was delicious and I don't think you could go wrong with ordering any of the other pizza's either. . The meatballs were good considering I'm not a huge fan of meatballs, but my boyfriend loved them. . The Kale salad was good. A very large portion with deep green kale leaves, unlike the chopped kale at grocery stores. Ask for the Pancetta and bread crumbs on the side if you're looking for something healthy. . All in all, it was well priced fare and a good experience. . 3. 5 overall.","We're so lucky to have this place close by for our lunch spot go to! Unique style pizza that is incredibly tasty- you can taste the freshness and quality of all the ingredients.","Great pizza. Sometimes when I order a slice for lunch it's slightly burnt, but that doesn't stop me from coming back. This has never been a problem when ordering a whole pie. I highly recommend stopping here.","We had to wait forever and the pizza wasn't good. I went with 5 other people and none of us liked our food.","So far in our first few months in Toronto this has been our favourite spot for pizza.  . They seem to have an endless list of pizzas to try and the flavours are really different. It is cheesy goodness and what I would call home style pizza but I haven't had anything in Toronto that touches it yet. . Will be returning.","The pizza was awesome. A very big piece for only a little money, but we came in 1. 5 hours before closing, and there was only one piece left and it didn't seem like they were willing to make more even though there were two of us. It was a very weird experience.","First off a confession: I've never stepped foot inside of Pasta Brioni. But I've been getting taking out from the joint since, literally, the day I moved into my house. I stick to the basics--a nice pollo con penne dish and a white pizza. I like it. The delivery is quick in the neighborhood and the drivers are always cute. I'd choose Brioni's over any chain any day, but I'm that sorta gal.","Excellent wine selection, food and service. I really enjoy the environment, very chic place. Reasonable prices. If you go, you have to try the spinach and Brie pizza.","On  Monday January 2, I arrived at 9:02pm for a 915pm reservation for 3 people. The waitress requested that we wait while the table was prepared in the dining area. After a few minutes the table was ready. However, she asked if we would like to sit at the bar. We politely declined. She then indicated the table would be ready at 915pm and to leave and return at that time. Meanwhile, it was about 9:07pm. We left and walked around Old Montreal for a few moments and returned at 915pm. When we arrived, she politely escorted us to the same table that was prepared earlier. Very awkward. Not to mention the pizza appetizer was amazing, but the main courses Lasagna, Gnocchi and Pescadora were cold when they were brought out. Overall, between the hostess and the selection of food I would not recommend this place. However, our waiter was fantastic. I hope Bevo-Pizzeria uses this feedback constructively to improve the overall restaurant experience. Great Potential.","Simply THE best pizza anywhere. Very good donuts also though i haven't eaten any donuts in years (from anywhere). Very nice staff. Friendly and on the ball. Timely service. . Did i mention really great pizzas?. And at more than reasonable prices.","Although I'm always scared to order because of all the bad reviews, my order has never taken more than 30 minutes to get to my house. The pizza is good too. I do always order online so I can't speak for the service over the phone. Online is cheaper too so I recommend doing it that way.","Finally went to try this place out. For a Thursday night, they were pretty busy. After arriving we were able to sit down immediately, and greeted fairly quickly by the waiter who brings water. The decor and environment is very nice. It seems like they were a little understaff for the amount of business they did have though. It took about 10 minutes to get a drink order in, then to order food. The bread they give you for starter is really good, we did ask for more when we ordered our food and the request was not fulfilled till right before our actual food was brought, about 30 minutes. The kitchen is open so you can watch them make pizza and pasta, which we watched our pasta get hand made and that was enjoyable, along with the taste of everything was amazing. I gave it only 4 stars because the understaffing was obvious and waiting for two beers, to place a food order, wait time for a side order of bread, in my opinion was too long. We ordered the starter meatballs, 2 beers and one spinach ravioli. The waitress did her best, along with one other waiter, the rest seemed to only drop off and pick things up. I would go again, but with the hopes not that the food is made faster but that the controllable small requests are fulfilled in a faster manner.","If you like sweet crust, sweet sauce and cold pizza then this is the place for you! The crust was dry and so sweet that it could have passed for a mediocre cookie. And the sauce was sweet to the point of cloying. The cheese had already begun to congeal and harden by the time it came out. The wait staff dissapeared and were impossible to get a hold of. Its as if they knew we'd send it back if they made eye contact. . The appetizers were pretty good but the portions were so paltry that they barely provided more than three bites. The description in the menu was that they were \"great for sharing\" Um. . . . no, methinks not. . Honestly this is the worst pizza I've had in years. I don't understand the hype, perhaps just the Pittsburgh Ross Park location is bad. But I know I won't waste my time or money there again. If you want good pizza pretty much any other place will give you a better meal and for a lot less. . My recommendation for amazing wood fired pizza (and far cheaper) is Piccolo Forno in Lawrenceville. I'm sure there are tons of great places in da burgh for Pizza. CPK is NOT one of them.","First time at the new location. Very spacious inside. Everything we ordered was delicious - pizza roll is HUGE and loaded with cheese, pizza and hot chicken parm sub were yummy. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Rest rooms very clean. Can't wait til they bring back the lunch buffet!","Just wish the pizza was a little bit better. It wasn't bad but not worth what you pay. Great service, however we were one of the only people there since we got there right when they opened","Gotta give it a 4 since the pizza is pretty good, not the best, but the best you will find on East Sahara.  . I have never dined in, and probably never will because the place always seems a little dead and the waitress/cashier/hostess/manger person is always having a spat with the cook. I have picked up from here many times, there is always a different person running the show are that individual has never been very personable. . They do not deliver, so dine-in and carry-out are your only options. Definitely call ahead and time your drive to arrive at the restaurant after your pizza is ready. Get your pizza and get out! That is my advice. . The pizza has been consistently good. You won't be disappointed with the pie.","They are always friendly when I go in they always show me the pizza before I leave to make sure it's right and the pizza is always hot","I was Craving pizza and this place definitely satisfied that.  1st pizza place I've had since I moved from up North. So far so good.","We love this family owned pizza place! The staff is very polite and friendly and the food is fresh. They even make their own ice cream! Pizza AND ice cream? Heaven. . It's a casual, everyday-looking family owned place with not the greatest of parking but, still so well worth it once you have a taste! . I recently tried their garlic/parm wings, which were unusually great, so if you like variety, give these folks a try! Can't go wrong with anything. Next time I'm trying the Stromboli. . They are all about the food and service, which is exactly what I love about them. The dining area is kinda small but they do deliver!. Don't get me started on that homemade, delicious ice cream, with flavors like banana pudding, chocolate almond coconut and key lime!","I was here about 2 months ago, (hey i been busy ok)  this pizza was very very good , I had  2 slices of white cheese pizza one with spinach one with tomatoes, 1st)  I was completely stuffed for about $5 bucks and it was some of the best tasting pizza Ive ever had - this side the mississippi . . . im serious, and ill be back","They make pizza to go, but it seems like people mostly go there after a night of partying. I ordered a pizza to take up to my hotel room at the D and we enjoyed it. Don't eat it after it cools down though!","Amazing pizza and calzones - and nice staff to boot! We never have any leftovers.","Have been twice. Acceptable food, even if marginally overpriced. A better price point would be 2 simple pies and 2 drinks for under, rather than over $20. . My only complaint is with staff. The place is new. I get that. They hire kids. I get that. Training is hard. I get that. But managers are right there, not observing. First visit, a young man working the pizza line and cash register grew frustrated and began banging his forehead and hair, gently, against the food prep surface, in full view of customers (I did discreetly say something to the young man, but not the manager. Give the kid a break). Last night, a young lady also working line and register decided, again in full view of customers, to spend her time arguing with an apparent boyfriend/brother/whatever about why he *couldn't* apply for a job and work where she worked, for a long time, ignoring customers waiting and shaking their heads. . Management needs to be more observant, to step in when teens (who just don't know better) don't behave as they should in the workplace. Their training needs to include behavior as well as how to build a pizza or work the cash register. . And get some modestly larger beverage cups. What you have are too small.","Standard Pizza Nova, meaning my go-to spot for chain pizza. Consistent quality, fast service, no issues. Had a slice of Canadian - all good. . But the best part was listening to the guys in line after me (while waiting for my slice to heat up) asking if in the future they can call ahead to order their pizza instead of ordering it there and waiting for them to make it. Um, yes - yes you can. They hadn't heard of being able to call in - what? Lol ok maybe they're new, still - it was entertaining and a good way to pad a review for which I really don't have much more to add otherwise.","The first time we went, the place had been opened for a week. Food was average. Nice neighborhood joint. We had a server that was clueless and ruined the experience for us. I gave them some slack because it was opening week, but the server had no idea of the beers they served. We decided to give them another shot a month later, the service was great, but the food was still not that great. For some reason they season the food with quite a bit of salt in everything, which really ruins the flavor. We tried two pizzas which came out undercooked and the lasagna which was ok minus the insane amount of salt and being burnt on the bottom. . Great ambience for a drink, but the pizzas, pastas are not that great.","My cousin and I came here for lunch early on a Saturday, like around 11. We actually found parking. We tried the day before but could not find parking. So here's the lowdown on my lousy star rating because I love Oregano's. This location and now this experience was horrible. The food was awesome but that's only going to happen if you are lucky enough to find parking or walk here. . First; the parking SUCKS. I cannot scream that loud enough. When the \"Bear\" diner or whatever it was called was next door on the corner, the parking was manageable. Now, Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers is there. There is simply NO parking. We came on a Friday afternoon, late, around 4 and we drove around the parking lot twice before leaving and heading up to Valle Luna. I feel sorry for the Karate place and other businesses in this shopping center because the parking is horrendous. . We sat on the patio. It was a nice day, not 100+ degrees yet so we opted for the patio. Plus, as we walked into the host area it was freezing inside. There was no way I was going to sit in an ice box so out we went. There was a large, 12+ group on the patio closest to the parking lot. At the far end of the patio was a couple. The host sat us in the middle, next to the fire pit. I was ok with this because I get annoyed when I get sat next to people when there are tons of empty tables. I know about the whole server section thing but when the patio is empty, the patio IS the section. . Second; when the server or a runner or a manager or WHOMEVER brings a plate of food, if there is an empty plate sitting on the table, CLEAR IT. This didn't happen. We ordered a great large house salad to split and when we were finished with it the pizza we ordered arrived. The runner put the pizza down and off she went without taking the empty salad plate. Oh well. . Third; Stealing. Yep, you read that right. When our bill came it was $31. 93. I put down a $50 bill and asked for change. I got $18 back. OK, I know what you're thinking. It's only 7 cents TJ, really. But it's STEALING. The server has no right to keep my change even if it's just 7 cents. This was something that was stressed when I got my degree, what was taught to me in culinary school and by my peers in the hospitality consulting world and should be considered common sense. My cousin and I talked about this and wondered how much change would be owed before the server actually included it. 10 cents, 25 cents. And if you think about it, if a server kept 7 cents from every table they handled, that would probably amount to a nice chunk of change (sorry for the pun) over the course of a year. . Our server was Christian. As I said, the food was good. Our large house salad ($6. 39) was great. I get it every time I'm at Oregano's if I'm having pizza. It is THE BEST SALAD deal by far.  . The Pizza was good but as is the case most of the time with the thin crust, the outer edge was burnt. I know it's a thin crust, but if the crust is ALWAYS burnt on the edges, maybe Oregano's should consider investing in commercial crust shields like they use on pies. The black edges just do not look appetizing and to be honest, are carcinogenic. (just saying). I love the fact that almost always I'm asked if I want a drink to-go. Which I appreciate. So that's the dilemma. . Crappy parking, table not cleared, not the right change, great salad, great pizza but burnt crust, to-go drink. 2 Stars.","Wood oven pizza very good. I made my own. Real cheese, fresh ingredients. Good garlic bread to start. Staff very nice, music not too loud, tables a good size. I nearly fainted when my bill came to almost  $29. including tip for a personal sized pizza with 4 toppings. I only had water to drink. Pizza on the salty side.","As a far west-sider, Noventa is a great spot to stop in for a quick lunch. The staff is very friendly and the pizza is delicious. The pizza is made in 90 seconds in the brick oven with a very crispy crust. I have had their mozzarella with cherry tomatoes and pesto, as well as the gorgonzola salad. All of their ingredients are super fresh, the staff is wonderful and the prices are reasonable. A great little spot to have on this side of town.","Red, White, and Green pizza -- Yummy!!!  (I think it's the same one Morgan T recommended. )  I make trips across town just for that pizza.","This was our first time here. Our waiter wasn't that detailed as to how the pizza should be ordered and well didn't even read the menu until after we order. . Anyhow we order 1 pizza which is 6 slices. . I forgot the pizza price but each topping is $2, which adds up quickly. LoL. The pizza was yummy, nice and flavorful. Crust was thin and had crunch. . We also order a salad which we also enjoyed, it had beans in it. . Service was good, but could have been better. . Price is high compared to other joints. . . . Pizzeria and Blaze is a lot better, but here in Vegas you sometimes have no choice when your hungry and don't want to leave the hotel.","This has become our go to pizza place. I love there crust and all there specialty pizzas seem to have there own seasoning on the crust (I think I've had all the specialties). There pasta is ok and there zucchini needs more if a crunchy batter but its still ok. The delivery people are always nice and friendly (I think he prob doesn't even have to gps my house anymore. ) and it may take up to an hour sometimes for the pizza to get here but it's always hot and fresh. Had a forgotten soda once but i hot a free one next time. Really good place.","we ended up at Sauce before the oregon pep rally for the national championship game, mainly because we were already in the area and it wasn't too busy.  it's one of those places where you order from the counter, find a seat, and they bring the food out to you when it's ready.  the pizza is thin crust, which i like, but it really have much flavor, which was disappointing.  the atmosphere left something to be desired as well.  i didn't love it, i didn't hate it, it was ok.  i would go back again out of convenience, but it wouldn't be a destination spot for me.","Delicious pizza!  We had the Magahritta and House special. I highly recommend this place to anyone in or visiting Las Vegas.","Sicily's Pizza is so good. The pizza is so tasty and the price is so CHEAP!  I love this place and go there all the time because it is such a good deal for delicious pizza. Please don't hesitate to order pizza here. It is delicious, cheap, and very fast service!","Love this bar. We have been visiting the Burrell inn for years. Amazing wings, pizza, beer, and apps. The chicken salad is a weekly take out for my family. I get it with breaded chicken. If you go to drink ask for the river hound it's Jameson red bull and grenadine, it's fantastic and they make it best. The owner is almost always there and he makes you feel welcome. If you don't like the smoke the outdoor seating areas are complete with coverage and tv, s. Please go to the Burrell Inn . INN FOR THE WIN","I could have saved money by buying a frozen pizza from Costco and bought frozen chicken fingers. Pretty much what I received. Won't go back there. And we even picked it up, was not even hot. . luke warm at best.","Episode 1:. I almost forgot I alone can eat a whole Neapolitan pizza with a Salad and a Dessert. . as I have the Lunch Prix Fixe. . . So for 6 of us and 5 of them males. . . I should have ordered at least 6 pizzas. . . . but with these 3 pizzas. MARGHERITA, ALSICCIA E FUNGHI, SPARTA  Though tastes good but did leave us unsatisfied!!. Piola's pizza selection is quite good. . . and I love thin plate bread type pizza. Though they can be baked for a little longer without being burnt, then they would have be perfect!!. Episode 2:. All you can eat Gnoochi with 12 different sauces at $14. 99. . . Good price if you are into gnoochi. Personally I found the gnoochi at Piola is not too good. . . Some are too starchy. . some are chewy. . . some are mushy. . . really lack consistency!!. And after a few round. . . I swear I am not going to have any gnoochi again for a while. . . . BTW, the Sangria ($26/pitcher) is really good!! Great for sharing with your friends and the best part of the meal!! Too bad it is not a All You Can Drink Sangria Night!!. Services were excellent both times. . . Piola is great for groups as our server was able to give us all separate bills!!","Very yummy NY style pizza for a great price! A slice of cheese was $4 and pepperoni was $5, which you can't beat on the south side! Full of flavor and you won't walk away hungry. . . They also have a good selection of pops to choose from, even some I have never seen before! The ranch was not very good but amazing pizza!","Have only been there once since they reopened, but I would definitely go back. It's a nice casual restaurant with friendly staff. The hoagies were excellent. The pizza looked good, I plan to try it next time.","So I really wanted Italian food, but something different to where I normally go. Ester's Kitchen has a great atmosphere with delicious food. The interior of the restaurant is so nice from their yellow booths to the clay plates. I ordered the Agnolotti pasta dish with a Tarantella cocktail. The pasta was great and the sauce that went with was sweet yet creamy which I'm always here for. The cocktail honestly tasted a bit like black licorice and peach ring candy at the same time, but I must say I enjoyed it. For dessert, I had the Butterscotch Boudino which was great as well. It had a little cookie crumble on top and it wasnt too sweet. The staff was kind and our waiter made some great suggestions considering it was our first time there. The only drawback was the amount of food you get. Once I started to really taste the pasta, it was all gone.  . I may try a pizza next time.","Great food &amp; drinks, great prices, service was awesome. Hubby had the beef tips and I had the chicken piccata. Our kids (3 &amp; 6) shared the cheese pizza and we all shared the wedge salad, phenomenal.","Really good food. Wings, a sandwich, and a pizza were ordered for delivery,  it took over an hour, which is the reason the 5th star is missing. Had I been told, I would have picked it up.","I don't now if I can write a fair review since my significant other and I stopped by at two pm in the middle of summer and were literally the only people there BUT we had a nice time. Cheap beer, some cool drink selections, and the bar guy was nice. We got a flatbread which was pretty good too. It's not five star pizza but it hit the spot and it was a good price. If we move to Tempe this would be somewhere we'd visit again!","The 2nd star is for the convenience of the location - if you're attending/exhibiting at the las vegas convention center, you can walk right into the center in minutes. That's the only plus. . I don't know where to begin. I'm sitting here in a 19 dollar office chair, i can't hear the tv over the noise of the minifridge (sounds like a helicopter is about to crash into the room) and i just paid 20 dollars and waited an hour for a room service pizza that was served on the plastic tray that they microwaved it on. I went down to meet someone for dinner and a girl tried to steal my phone near the exit to the street. There has been a room service cart down the hall with old food on it for 32 hours. 3/6 lights in my room are operational. I bumped into a wall and dust came out of the ceiling. There's that number of cops that makes you feel like something is wrong instead of feeling safer. The water pressure in the shower is so low it feels like someone is just sweating on you. The mattress looks like a mountain range. . The staff have all been very helpful and friendly.","I think the best part about Chinato is the service. Definitely hands down one of the best greeting crews in downtown Cleveland. I'd definitely like to come here more often to spend my night with this lively crew!. The pizza is also pretty good here too.","Sabrina was our server and was awesome  . Always checking back and offered a pitcher of margaritas that we agreed on and were great . The ribs, the fried shrimp and the flat bread pizza were great .","Loving Heist. They have it all. They have a great menu and an awesome bar. Then when you think you've seen it all, they have a huge brewery taproom.  #WhatWhat. Love this place. We stopped in after a mother's day brunch. Great servers and service. Stephan, the man behind the bar, knew his stuff. And, he was all about talking up the goodness of Heist Brews.  . We thought we were coming in for a quicky drink, but we stayed and ate a wood fired pizza. #GoodTimes. . I enjoy the beers and the Bacon and Cheese Flatbread wood fired pizza is the stuff of legend.  . I live the parking, bathrooms rock. The price is decent. The pizza was a bit small for $12 but after $3. 75 Drafts, I'm golden.  . Great service from Sky and Stefan","I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The pizzas are spectacular, and they have really good gluten free crust for all you fellow celiacs. . I recommend the Chicken Caesar &amp; Parmesan pizza. It's basically an olive oil crust with a caesar salad on top. It sounds odd, and is a little tough to eat cleanly, but it is totally worth it!. Also, the business model is super efficient, and all the employees have been very helpful and friendly.","This is my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh. Don't know why exactly, everything just comes together perfectly at this place. 6 stars.","Quite frankly, I don't get the hype. None of the crusts are particularly good--the guys making them have no idea what they're doing. Crusts shouldn't be semi-soft (even if it's regular), and the thin crust is simply mediocre. . And then there are the specialty ones. If you want something that's really vomit-inducing, go for the tailgate pizza. This is simply mediocre pizza at best--cheese and pepperoni can really only be compared to Dominos. . I'm a \"Coastie\" (I hate that term. . . ), and we take pizza pretty seriously back East--I would also like to note that the pile of dough and glop you get in Chicago is not pizza. Justice Scalia certainly agrees with me on that note. Glass Nickel, though? Sigh. Sigh. Sigh.","Great pizza , best in downtown Las Vegas. prices are good service is very good and fast give it a shot if you're downtown","My family and I came to Upper Crust after receiving a free pizza card from Yelp's playdate. It was a pretty long drive for us, but well worth it. We had good service. We asked the server what she suggested and she said that the mozzarella was a must. I always ask for suggestions, but normally still order what I originally wanted. This time I listened. I am so glad that I did. The fried mozzarella was wonderful!  I would order it again. It was sooo fresh!  We also ordered the mushrooms which were ok. The pizza looked beautiful, but it tasted ok. . . it needed a tad bit more marinara. I would go back.","We have been ordering from Papa John's for years but lately some of the orders seem a little stingy in how they're prepared. One prime example are their chicken wings, they seem to be less meaty than in past orders. One other example are the topping proportions. When I order extra cheese I expect the pizza to be dripping with it and both pizzas came where I could see empty spots where they had no cheese.","Very good pizza but also very expensive. Not sure this would be a regular pizza stop because of that. Friendly people.","I ordered 3 WELL DONE &amp; THIN pizzas. One cheese, one extra and one green pepper, sausage, onion. . When I got my pizzas they were soggy, undercooked and all the toppings were in the center and there was about 2-3 inches of crust. The pizzas were so thick and soggy. I asked for thin and well done. . So I called to see what was up with the pizzas and the woman on the phone was so rude. . So I paid for disgusting pizza and rude customer service. Pizza Hut would have been better than this.","This is the worst hotel experience I've ever had in my life. It took over two hours for chicken fingers and pizza. And they came back to the room at 4:30 am to take the food back? What hotel comes in and confiscates the food? This is outrageous. They woke everyone in the room up. Worst mistake ever staying at this shit hole.","One of my new favorite places to eat. Love the modern wedge salad with chicken and one of the employees suggested pepperoni and bacon on the Margherita pizza which I've had several times and simply love.","My hubby and I decided to check out 12 West Brewing and while here, opted to try Fire and Brimstone next door. I was asking the guy (James) about the lamb options for the hummus as I used to live in Turkey and love me some spicy ground lamb! I told him about the little pizzas in Turkey called 'lamacun' and he was like, \"hey, want me to try and replicate it?\" Hell to the yeah! I am now a huge fan of this place! One, when does this happen?? Never in my life has someone opted to veer from the menu and be creative just for the fun of it. Two, it was quality food and super flavorful. Three, the beers at 12 West are bomb and you can eat the Fire &amp; Brimstone's bomb pizza while drinking bomb beer. We will absolutely be back and will recommend to everyone we know!","The Autumn Greens salad tasted average (drowned in Apple Vinaigrette sauce). . The pizza quality tasted average compared to Pieology. Choose the Genovese over the Gianna. . Pizza are 11 inches and are cut in four. If you can't eat much, I would recommend sharing a pizza with someone. You'll probably get full from 2 slices.","Let me start off by saying the only reason I didnt give this place 5 stars is because it is extremely pricey! However, it is delicious! I know many locals try to steer clear of the strip but really this place is worth a visit. Be prepared to spend some $$ though. . This place is one of my top pizza places. We opted for a full pepperoni pizza as I dont care for slices. The pizza was flavorful and the crust was amazing. Definitely recommend if you love pizza!","Last night, I was lucky to have gone to PIzza e Pazzi for a second time. . I went with a couple of friends (based on my recommendation). . Although we noticed one bottle to be over-priced, considerably, on the menu, I believe we had a very reasonably priced, and good-tasting, Chianti. . We shared a appetizer of rice balls with mozzarella - it was crispy and tasty. . One of my friends ordered a red pizza and was brought a white version. . When we questioned our waiter on this, he said \"I think that one should be on the white menu\" . . . well, that's not really a good enough answer; he definitely should have informed us before finalizing our order. . While our table had very mixed reviews of the pizza, I was extremely pleased with the product. I had the Tre Funghi. . The crust was crispy in parts and bagel-like in other. Perfect in my mind. . The sauce was tasty . . . the mushrooms delectable. . The spicy oil was good . . . however, I would have loved some pepperoncini like they have at Terroni (which happens to be one of my fave spots for pizza). . Most importantly, I was blown away by the engagement of the owners . . . Sandrelle and Danilo. They stayed at our table for a good while chatting with us about everything and nothing. . We were treated to Grappa at the end of the evening . . . and for dessert, Danilo put together a plate of everything so that we could try it all. . The new location is opening soon at Christie and St. Clair . . . watch out LIbretto and Queen Margherita, there is a new kid in town, and they want to take the crown!. Salute Pizza e Pazzi!","Average mall with mcdonals, fitness center chinese resturant pizza pizza. Metro Price chopper etc. Nothing fansy","Very nice place good selection of draft beers and happy hour. Been here a few times and Adam the bartender is awesome! Very personable and informative for travelers. Recommend this place over the kitchen bar across the street. Food is good and pizzas re very good.","We drove from Grand Canyon to Los Angeles, but insanely decide to drive off the path just to come and eat here, not the city (Sorry Vegas!). Well! It's our first time since their expansion. Same menu. Service and food were excellent as always, but food came in not as hot as usual. The great addition as part of expansion is the wood burning pizza oven!!  I love the oven.","I would not recommend this place at all. . Menu was not good. . There was a 96 dollar steak that didn't even come with a side next to some pathetic pizza options. . We decided on only appies. . We had some cooked cheese which was some burnt disgusting mess and a cheviche which was some tiny pieces of seafood swimming in oil and lemon, gross!!. I would never go back !!!","Very fast delivery but this very well might be the worst pizza I've I've ever had! High prices very small 12 inch pizzas very little flavor. I'm not being mean but I don't know how you can really mess pizza up","First of all, the food wasnt great, the pizza was flat and flavorless. The customer service was AWFUL! We wanted to order 2 main st pizzas. The server said to us, in a nasty voice, there is only one piece. She asked the chef if there was any more coming out, he said no. I had to ask when there was going to be a new pizza. The wait was 15 mins. We waited and ordered 2 pieces of pizza, mozzarella sticks and parmasan  garlic fries. The garlic fries were doused in garlic and no parm. The mozzarella sticks were the only good thing about this experience. Except for the fact that we got back to the room before we noticed there wasn't any dipping sauce, or forks. When we went back for the sauce and forks the employees were standing in the middle of the dining room talking. None of them even glanced at us, and we were standing at the cash! The chef came out from the back and asked us what we needed after about 2 minutes. He obviously doesn't deal with customers often, but he was the only one that was willing to help. Worst service I've ever had at any restaurant I've ever been. Simply awful.","We just ate here with a group of six. We're from out of town and had no idea that the restaurant was closing in 20 minutes. We we're seated on the sidewalk tables. And our waitress (her name was Amanda) didn't tell us about a last call then was very rude when our party asked to order more drinks. Amanda even went as far as lying to us saying that she told us there was a last call. She neglected to stop by our table often enough for refills and brought us our 2 pizzas but didn't show up with plates for us to eat off of for 5+ minutes. Amanda might be better off working as a greeter at Walmart. . The margarita pizza was a bit soggy, but the barbecue pizza was pretty good. They also serve lemonade in flimsy plastic cups. . .","Best pizza!!friendly and prompt service pizza is always fresh and hot when it's delivered!!. Definitely generous on the toppings","We have been here many times and it is slowly going down hill, sad to say. It took 45-60 minutes for our food to come out. Once we got our food, the pizza was burnt. I actually spoke with the owner. He apologized and voided the pizza and sent a fresh one home. So, great on the customer service. . . . not so good on the wait time and quality of food. I wish them the best and hope things improve soon. . UPDATE:. Silly me. Someone reached out from the restaurant claiming the menu was totally overhauled and under new management. Nope. And still no knowledge of happy hour specials, server had to go check the price on every beer we asked about. Just here to use my $8 coupon. It's sad, really. Maybe Panini's or Winking Lizard will buy this place?!?!","Our go to place in town. It took A LOT of trial and error to get here. We've tried a lot of the supposed \"best\" pizzas in town but none compare to Pop up Pizza. We lived in San Francisco for years and this is the only pie that comes close to the best out there. . We get delivery most of the time but sometimes have to go pick it up because their driver doesn't start until 6p which seems a little ridiculous. I'm not going to deduct a star for that because, the pie is so good, I'll pick it up if that's what it takes. . The Goodman is awesome and the garlic knots are the best I've ever had. Don't believe it, try one yourself, you'll be hooked!","Wife and I tried this place (delivery) since it was close and got good reviews. I have to say it was some of the worst pizza I've had in a while. I would easily prefer digiorno over this. The toppings were bland and the pizza dough was very hard and stale tasting. Unfortunate since I was really hoping it would be good with how close it is.","Ordered a Slice and some wings. I did not expect the slice to be huge. Their one slice is the size of small-medium pizzas at other places. I love the taste and it was done in NY style my favorite. . Saw that they have a huge 28 inch pizza. And also many subs and salads, spaghetti and more than enough appetizers to fill you up. . Not many people inside most orders were carry out. I always support local businesses and this place is run by husband and wife. . Definitely give it a try. However expect a little wait. Everything is made from scratch!","This place has become our favorite pizza place in the east valley. Their speciality Pizzas are just down right amazing. Friendly staff, great location, nice patio, byob and a great brewery right there. We love it!","Rude staff and owner. Sitting at the bar, we had to keep asking for service for both drinks and food. Those around us had no problem. It wasn't busy either. We ordered 1. 5 hr before the kitchen closed. An hour and 15 minutes later we learned that they had forgotten to put our order in. Since the kitchen was now about to close, they didn't want to serve us. When they reluctantly did, none of the food was even luke warm. The owner insisted that she buy us a drink or free dessert to 'correct' the problem if we keep the cold food (fried fish). Sent it back, 10 minutes later we're told that they're going to make us new food (what were you doing the last 10?). 15 minutes after this, still sitting with an empty glass and no food, we left to get a frozen pizza.","Great pizza. Looks like a hole in the wall but if deserves a chance. This is the best pizza I've found in Cleveland yet. Good prices for the pies and friendly staff.","I love the fact that this Dominos is in my backyard. When Im in a pinch, to tired, or just flat out lazy, I order carry out from this location. . Dominos makes all kinds of pizzas, and now subs too!  They make thier pizza quick, and you can order online, phone, or walkin. . I walked in last night and placed my order. The place was clean, staff was friendly and professional. Those three things keep me coming back for more!. I plan on returning to this location for more pizza in the future.","What a treasure!!!! The pizza is outstanding. My husband had the Philly cheesesteak. Although the flavor of the sandwich was good it was sparse on the meat. Had the Sal's pizza and wings both very good. We will be back.","Wild mushroom and fig pizza was exceptionally lovely. I skipped the arugula. Crust is quite good, nearly as close to true Italian as you can get in the US. Keep up the great work, and I will be ordering this regularly. Thanks!","Had a bbq chicken pizza which was pretty good! Odd atmosphere. . . . Not busy. Mix of young and older people. I was here for the dinner crowd, so it might be different later.","What the heck happened to them??? I recall several years back when their pies were REALLY good, New York City back home tasty good like Rocco's on rainbow/215 and Verrazano's further up on Rainbow and Flamingo. When your hungry, you gotta eat but it was very bland, like chewing a rubber cheese with less sauce and I thought Little Caesars were bad. I'm from Manhattan and I DEFINITELY Know what pizza's suppose to be and taste like. I asked for bacon and they grabbed chopped sliced a piece of ham to make it look like it. A rule of thumb. A pie may probably taste what it looks like and hopefully not too salty at that . . bottom line, I got what I pay for.","I was stoked to see there was a deli/pizza/grocery area in our hotel. I unfortunately wasn't too impressed with it though.  . Pros:. + Convenient if you are staying at the hotel. + They have a few necessities should you have forgotten something at home. + Open late . + Lots of sodas/juices/drinks to choose from. . + Staff is friendly enough. . Cons:. - Very overpriced (yes, its Vegas and most places are overpriced. . . nevertheless still irritating). - Wish the deli had a few vegetarian sandwiches on their menu. - No vegetarian premade or microwave food - well except a green salad, that gets so boring to us veg-heads. . - The Cheesecake Factory cheesecake that the deli was selling was super stale tasting. At $5 a piece for a small portion, I would have thought it would be fresh. Both the banana foster cheesecake and the red velvet cheesecake we tried were pretty bad. . - Pretty expensive pizza and it didn't look the best so we skipped it. . This hotel is amazing, but I wish someone could make some improvements to the food assortment and quality in The Marketplace.","Somewhat similar to McGill Pizza. I was not a fan of the sausage. The pepperoni also did not have that much flavor, but that seems to be because the sausage was overpowering. I did like the crust, which was crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. There was more than enough sauce of the pizza which tasted nice, not too bold or too sweet. The only major issue that I had was that there was a piece of plastic or parchment paper cooked into the pizza (under one of the sausages). If I were to return, I would probably just get a cheese pizza, as they pile on the cheese and it tastes great. However, if you get a cheese pizza, I would recommend having it well done.","Good food, rude service (except for the waiter), way too expensive. When we arrived they refused to sit us because we were waiting on two people. More than half the tables were empty on a Wednesday at 8pm. There was no chance they would fill up by the time our entire party arrived. The waiter was nice but did not refill our water at all. The pizza was good with lots of cheese but certainly not worth the price. When we went to checkout the guy was pretty rude and took forever to give us our change. Also, how is such an expensive restaurant cash only? They can easily afford a credit card machine and should have one for $30 pizzas.","Ordered a pizza to a nearby hotel and they never delivered it and charged my card. . . Not sure what kind of scam they have going on. Beware of this place.","Fresh, fast and flavorful. . . what's not to love!?!  We ordered at the register and grabbed a table.  . The hubs and I split a Gorgonzola salad and margherita pizza. Salad was awesome; walnuts and dried cranberries w/and balsamic and olive oil dressing. The pizza was was also really good. It comes in one size fits all, which happens to be about a 10\" Napoli style pizza that's cut into 4 big wedge slices. It could easily be eaten solo or shared if y'all's appetite is light or you're ordering other items. Perfect for a quick lunch or fast dinner.","I wasn't sure what to expect when my friend suggested Italian food on Spadina (Chinatown). Man oh man, blown away!!! Such fresh pasta and pizza. The pizza dough was so fluffy but crispy, and oh so buttery. The noodles were prepared perfectly and magically absorbed all the yummy flavours of the other ingredients. Definitely going back to Levetto in Chinatown. Almost forgot to mention that the service was top notch! Great experience :)","We had the BBQ pizza and the Fontina Pesto burger and they were both delicious! :) The bun on the burger was soft and the meat was moist!  The scenery around the restaurant is beautiful! Misters are installed so it's nice to sit outside even on a hot day. My husband and I enjoyed a nice lunch date. We'll definitely be back.","I went there January 2012. First off, the food was gross. The salad was premixed and they wouldn't even let you pick any of the toppings out yourself you had to find someone behind the bar, which was harder to do since they only had one girl working the front for a little while. The lettuce was not crispy or fresh cause it was sitting in ranch WAY before I got to it. . The pizza was even worse. I completely understand the strange choices like cheeseburger pizza but a lot of pizzas were like that. They only had 2 pizza that were adult friendly. Those 2 pizza tasted like they were under the heat lamp to long and became dried out and hard. . The staff was really friendly but there was one worker who pretty much yelled as he worked. I was standing at the bar, while he was standing right next to me, he was talking to another employee who was standing on the other side of him but he was talking to him like he was yelling across the parking parking lot. I was VERY annoyed. . I went home to the website to find a email address to complain too, but the one they had on they site wasn't even working. Will not go again!","I have loved this restaurant, nice change of pace for area. Also have had issues ordering, kids behind sneeze guard learning customer service but pizza is good and love the Char house salad. Wondering if they changed their ranch dressing and crust lately? Seemed different on our 6 visit. They have great options for beer and wine. Favorite pizzas are the meat lovers and Piandina and cheese, though I was just told they won't have provolone cheese anymore.","Bonne pizza dans un beau cadre dans la Petite-Italie. Jeudi 20h30, restaurant rempli + terrasse ext\u00e9rieure remplie, heureusement que j'avais r\u00e9serv\u00e9 via une application de r\u00e9servation. Beau cadre int\u00e9rieur, ambiance italienne sympa dans la Petite Italie. En entr\u00e9e, salade d'endive 10$, l\u00e9g\u00e8re, plat principal, pizza  Diavola 15$, une des meilleures pizzas sur feu de bois que j'ai mang\u00e9. Prix corrects. Service ok. Client satisfait, j'y retournerai s\u00fbrement. . 4/5 visit\u00e9 en ao\u00fbt 2015.","Maybe my expectations were too high, given it's comparison to spots like Pizza LIbretto, but I was disappointed. And Libretto this ain't. . The atmosphere at Pizza e Pazzi was bustling and full of good energy. The owners (or managers?) actively on the floor and the servers hustling continually. Lots of engagement. We had to wait about 15-20 minutes for our reserved table because the party before us took their time, but it wasn't a big deal. . They started us off with some chewy walnut bread and nice condiments (caramelized onions, a vegetarian dip that I couldn't quite identify, sauteed mushrooms). Service was attentive, although the server seemed very disappointed that we weren't ordering lots of alcohol. . We all ordered salad and mains. The salads were decent. My mixed greens were literally just that with some very sweet cherry tomatoes. A little watery, maybe. My husband ordered a special salad of bufalo mozzarella and shaved truffles which should have been spectacular (especially for the $25 price tag) but was instead just average. The cheese was maybe a little too salty and water-logged. Not as nice as some high quality mozzas I've had in the past. . Pizzas were very good - just not outstanding. My tre funghi was yummy, but was under-seasoned to my taste. The margarita was much better (probably because they use the salty mozzarella that we tasted raw on the salad earlier) so it had more flavour. . Overall, it was very good pizza, if a bit doughy for this style. I agree with a recent reviewer - in this area I'd pick Marcellos over this place. It's more homey and less elegant but the flavours are just so much richer and they are much more generous. Pizza e Pazzi should focus more on their flavours and not try so hard in the \"We're new and chic\" category. Why would we spend $75 for a dinner for two (sans alcohol) when we could spend so much less and get better food elsewhere?. Vegetarian Score: 6. 5/10. Not as much choices as in other italian spots for veggies, but you won't walk away hungry.","Great pizza, excellent quality, good prices and always, always super friendly service; by everyone. Owner is all about supporting the community, such a great quality!!","I always order from here when I'm craving pizza for lunch. The pizza is greasy &amp; delicious, a bit over priced, but it's better than the other pizza shops that deliver to my work.","Spent a great, hot day walking around Toronto, and ended up at the Distillery District. As I'm not a tourist, I know that despite the charm of the bricks, the allure of the patios, and the line-ups out the door suggesting otherwise -- most of the food in the Distillery sucks. They charge you a premium because it's a tourist destination, but the service and the quality is usually lacking. . Instead, my friend and I started walking along King, not sure where we were headed. When we passed Mangia and Bevi, totally inconspicuous and only a stone's throw away from Distillery, I mentioned I had read it was good. You could tell they had a patio, even though no one was sitting on it. . Upon further inspection, they were indeed open. I went inside and the server came out and brought some chairs for us. I though the service was lovely - we were outside, but we never had to flag her down, we were never left without water. Our food came out as we asked (appetizer with the pizzas) and the bill came out promptly after being requested.   . The food was awesome. Pizza crust was delish. I liked the pizza we had with the grilled artichokes, mint, pecorino. . . . soooo good. The white pizza we had, with mushrooms, was good but made better when we added the meat from the carpaccio appetizer to it. Definitely a cute little spot; washrooms are kind of weird and in an office building with a number code to get in so ask before you go hunting for them. . Kitchen closes at 9 pm too, which is good to know before going. They take resos even for the patio!","This pizza joint at the Plaza is better than most food courts have. Its good, quick and reasonably priced. They even have good veggie options. If you're hanging out downtown, this is a good place to grab a quick bite and even a beer if you like. Staff was friendly and service was good.","On a summer Monday in Montreal when most restos are closed and are only a few restaurants open, we decided to try this place located in le plateau. We had a caprese salad and the truffle pizza. Nothing special but it did the job.","Meh. I feel like the pizza at streets of new york is pretty plain jane. . I came here for lunch with my boyfriend, the restaurant was clean and not too busy. Actually,  it wasn't busy at all. . Our server was nice, but we didn't see much of her so when we needed something,  she was nowhere to be found. . We were pretty hungry so we started off with the garlic bread sticks. When they came out, it looked like melted cheese on hot dog buns. The bread was frozen previously,  you could tell by the way the bread reheated and tasted. The marinara dipping sauce was also very watery and tasteless. . When our pizza came out, there was so much grease on it, I was surprised. The pizza was also pretty plain. Nothing special. . Overall,  I'd say that streets of new york is an over priced pizza place fir those who also enjoy pizza hut &amp; dominoes.","The food is amazing. We get the Grandma G's pizza and margaritas every time we go. The only downside to Oregano's is the noise and wait. I have never seen the wait shorter than 45 minutes and there is very little space to wait in. It's also very loud. But the food makes it all worth it.","After an unfortunate experience at New Tribe (just across the street), I came to Adrenaline when I woke up one day and decided that I wanted to get a tattoo. Some people wake up and say that they want to have pizza for lunch. Some wake up and say they want to go swimming. I woke up and said, \"let's get a tattoo\", so I did. . I went to Adrenaline because I had been meaning to try it. I knew a few people that went for piercings and tattoos and had no negative things to say about them. I agree. My tattoo artist was funny and kept the conversation going the whole time. He was funny and he was pretty good. I got a tattoo on the back of my neck. Line weights and shading was excellent. I've had the tattoo for 2 years now and it's still solid in color. . I was really pleased with my experience at Adrenaline. Great for walk-ins- only waited about 10 minutes for the next artist to be free, doesn't charge ridiculous prices, and has a great team working for them. My next tattoo, if there is one, will be at Adrenaline.","We normally get pizza. This time I tried the philly steak and cheese. Very disappointing. The bread was dry on top but the bottom was soaked in grease. They used orange cheese which didn't go well with the steak. . My husband got the calzone which was cold inside. Disappointed with this meal.","Really good pizza. . . we have not tried the other menu items yet. It appears the place is a hangout for a lot of regulars. That says something about the food. Service was fine. Only issue was people going outside the front door and smoking on the patio (close to the door). I didn't think this was permitted.","Great pizza and a really large selection of craft beers. Daily specials as well as happy hour special of $5 personal pizza and 1/2 price craft beer. Will be back next time I'm in town!","Duck Poutine Pizza. The sole purpose of coming to Bannock!. Bannock is a hip Canadian restaurant that is located on Bay and Queen directly across the Eaton Centre. The place itself is bustling with businessmen and hipsters all the same. Nice dining area with some odd decor and a small cafe on the other end as well. The menu isn't huge, which I like, and offers some nice comfort items like sandwiches, burgers, and pizza. But enough with the foreplay, onto the Duck Poutine Pizza ($16). . There's a reason many of these reviews you're reading is talking about this one dish. Never before have I heard of combining three items as popular in Ontario as pizza, poutine, and duck confit. The duck poutine pizza sounds like a problem for the arteries and Bannock actually did a fair job with it. . The pizza itself is a thin crust with a layer of mozzarella cheese and thin gravy. Then comes chunks and pieces of duck leg confit slightly cooked and topped off with an immense (overkill) amount of french fries. There was also a strong hint of rosemary, which didn't tickle my fancy. The pizza is HUGE and is possible to share between four people (or two hungry men). Sadly, my underwear must have been on too tight as I wasn't even man enough to finish a third of the pizza. . I enjoyed the different flavors you were getting from the pizza. The cheese was melted perfectly to where you had bridges of cheese stemming from the pizza to your plate. The fries were crisp and the duck meat was good. However, I just couldn't shake how salty the entire pizza was. The portion of the duck leg was rather weak, and they seemed to balance it out by throwing on more fries. The execution was a bit lackluster to say the least. . Overall, the pizza was a bit of a disappointment but was still rather good. It's a unique enough dish to where you better order it. My girlfriend absolutely loved it. (Her heart, maybe not so much, but she did). Bannock is good for people watching too as it's in a busy part of town (since it's right by the Eaton Centre) and is well worth a visit. \"","Have been here a few times and I am a fan overall. . I do love that they closed in their patio area to ensure a greater space as eating in their original space is tiny and unpleasant. . I get a pizza every time I go. Most recently I ordered the Genovese pizza with extra pesto. So delicious! Finished off the meal with a scoop of gelato, mint chocolate chip. Again, it was delicious! However, the one scoop was $7 which is far too much for the amount you get. You can get an entire tub of ice cream for that price. Yes, I get that home made should mean something and fetch a higher price. But not $7, perhaps $5?","Stopped by Old Montreal for a night and went to Yelp to find a place to eat. We were steered to Bevo because of the great reviews (and because hubby loves pizza) and we were not disappointed. We came around 8:30 on a Saturday night and, judging by all the full tables, were expecting to have a wait but were happy when we were seated right away. . For apps, we ordered the calamari, which was cooked and salted perfectly. Also, the waiter recommended that we try the Arancino (risotto ball with meat sauce). So good! Wish we ordered one to take home. . For an entree, we shared a pizza. Note that these are 10-inch, 4-slice pizzas so they are okay to share if you have appetizers, but not otherwise. We had the pizza with prosciutto, portobello mushrooms, and mozzarella. Delicious! And that's coming from New Yorkers! . For drinks, the old-fashioned is good and strong, if you're into bourbon. Try the berry mojito, if you want a cocktail. I also had a prosecco Sangria, which tasted similar to a mimosa but with a kick. . Overall, we loved the ambiance of Bevo. There was a variety of age groups here and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Seems to be a good place for groups - as we saw a bachelorette party and a birthday party being celebrated here. Also, they played great music!","If you're in Vegas, this is a must!!! I'm a huge fan of Chef Morimoto and we came here thinking we'd just dine here. . . never expecting to meet him! He was at the sushi station helping the other chefs and we walked in front of him and I busted my phone out to get his picture. . . he posed for me!!  We ended up getting a few pictures with him and he is such a nice man. . . doesn't speak English, but he's a cool guy. . Onto the food. . . the tuna pizza is to die for. The portions are very limited, but it's a great appetizer for three people to have two pieces each. I devoured this. . . so crisp and light. . My seared snapper wasn't that big of a portion but the flavor and texture. . . . goodness gracious. Simply delicious. My table also ordered the whole crispy fish (totally worth it), Chinese broccoli, and steak. Everything was scrumptious!. This is now my new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.","Still great pizza and wings. Loved that I can order off Yelp and pay too. Go there, walk in, get food, and be on my way.","Best pita bread IN THE VALLEY! I crave the pita bread enough to make me order a salad (a basket of it comes as a side with a salad) and their Ranch dressing is tasty (Hidden Valley packet tasty). . My go-tos are: the goat cheese (with spring greens) or the gyro feta salad. Salads are around $10 but pretty filling. . Non-pita lovers can get burgers or pizza :)","This is hands down the best pizza in our area. Ppl that prefer dominos or papa johns to this dont know what real pizza is.","Good pizza, Italian sausage was my favorite topping here. Small no frills dining room, delivery is better.","I'm a big fan of O&amp;B and comfort food and poutine! Of course I had to come to this place! Had to order the roast duck poutine pizza since I'm a poutine fanatic. When it came it looked delicious with lots of fries on the pizza. Unfortunately I found that the duck sauce didn't really go that well with the poutine. I guess I like my poutine salty. . For desserts I tried the s'mores pie and donut and they were divine. Ultimate comfort food for sure! It was very rich and flavourful and had great texture. Overall the atmosphere was great and the staff was awesome. The place might look not too great on the outside and close parking might be harder to find. I guess I will just stick to the original poutine.","Awesome place. Went for the first time today, beautiful patio and very rad decorations inside. Server had great recommendations, I settled on the Scarborough fair pizza. YUM! Was quiet when I went in but loved the atmosphere. Will be back!","Who doesn't love a store specifically for carbs? I feel like it's a little piece of heaven. . This is one of my regular stops during the weekend. I usually pick up some of the montreal bagels or a baguette (much cheaper than Cobbs). . and sometimes for fun I buy their pizza dough which is brilliant. . The staff has always been friendly and every pastry I have bought from there has been incredible. . If  I could give a venue 6 stars I would. . afterall this place has a great staff, amazing selection and some of the cheapest pricing.","This place is so f*ing good. Yes I have been to Italy multiple times and enjoyed the amazingly cooked pasta and pizza there and yes 99% of restaurant in America screw it up. Pasta is supposed to be al dente ok? Well yes the pasta here was cooked perfectly and the sauce so tasty. The bread is garlicy just the way I like it dripped in olive oil. I heard the manager or owner speaking Italian which explains the authentic dishes. . The only draw back the tiramisu was just ok","This is easily the best pizza in town. Have ordered multiple different items from this place and all were excellent! Always delivery within a timely fashion","Very fast seating, very nice Waiter and the food came out fast. . . Pizza was excellent as well as the wings. . . Wife and daughter loved it. Their specialty pizzas are awesome! Great food and Atmosphere!","My wife and I stopped in on our way to an expo. We were greeted by the smells of cooking pizza crusts - yum!  The place was very busy at dinner time on a Friday. We sat at the bar and our server was quickly over to us and took our drink orders. She took our order for the roasted cauliflower pizza with a big smile - supporting our choice. . The atmosphere was cozy and not over decorated. We enjoyed our salads with a very good dressing. . Our pizza came out quickly and we were overcome with the awesome smell of our pizza and we're delighted even more with the taste!  The small was enough for both of us plus leftovers!. I would highly recommend stopping in for a pizza and beer. I know we'll be back next time we're near there!","Having tried several of the restaurants on Baldwin St. , I figured you couldn't really go wrong with any of them! Boy was I wrong! Famished, my boyfriend and I decided to venture to Cafe La Gaffe for an early dinner. . Although everyone else in the restaurant seemed to be there enjoying a glass of wine, we were there for more than just a drink. Since it was too early (around 5:00) to be serving dinner, we were informed that the only two options we had to order from were the Appetizers and the Pizza's. . We decided we'd share some grilled calamari and a mediterranean pizza. The calamari was ok, nothing special on a bed of romaine lettuce mixed with some red peppers (again, nothing special) but no specific complaints. The 'pizza' was made of a dough I've never experienced before, it was very crusty and hard to chew! It didn't taste like pizza dough whatsoever and we were so disappointed we didn't want to finish the meal! . The only positive thing to say about the meal was that the vegetables tasted and looked very fresh! I'll have to say, I probably will never go back there seeing that Baldwin has many other great choices to choose from!","i really enjoy this pizza, not only becuase it's 24hrs and extremely reasonably priced, but it's just really good.","My friend waited in the pasta line for 45 minutes before she even ordered. My other friend and I ordered our pizzas and finished them before our friend waiting for the pasta had ordered. After approaching the manager about her frustration, he was rude and disrespectful. This place is completely inefficient and has no structure.","The pizza is out of this world and the service is too. A huge thank you to Dillon for coming in clutch with the sauce recommendations","Our reputation as a mecca for pizza continues to grow and Crisp certainly adds to the legend. This is almost a new category (Grandma style) and it doesn't fall under the normal classifications (Neapolitan, Chicago, Standard New York, etc. . . ) that dominate our landscape. . The crispy, buttery crust is the star of this show and it is closely followed by some incredible, tangy tomato sauce. Some might complain that your piece isn't drowning in cheese and that is ok because the two aforementioned items make the experience special. Pizza has become a multifaceted affair around here and Crisp is just one more wonderful way to explore the dish.","Good tasting pizza,  it looked a little under cooked, but it was tasty. Maybe it was my fault, because i like a little crispy, and forgot to mention to them on the phone. Thanks.","For years, Lot 17 has been my go-to location for anytime I need to meet someone for a meal. Many of my friends and co-workers are picky eaters and everyone can always find something they love to eat! My favorites include the stuffed burger (bbq sauce, mushrooms, onions, and peppers are stuffed inside the deliciously grilled burger), pita pizza, and sweet potato fries. The servers are always friendly and attentive, and have never made a mistake with any of my orders. . Good beer selection, friendly bartenders, and the jukebox in the bar area creates a fun ambiance (especially when everyone starts singing \"sweet caroline\" all together). . During the nicer weather, there are a few tables outside -- but get there early if you want to enjoy them!","I read something about this being one of the best pizza places in the U. S. , representing the state of Nevada. That was surprising! I passed by it a couple of times in a shady shopping area and decided to try it out in my own. The pizza was good, but I wouldn't go as far as saying it's the best in Nevada. The people there are pretty nice. I went back a second time and it was just OK. The bottom was soggy, and I don't like that in a pizza!","We had a big crew come in for brunch and the hostess greeted us promptly and had us all set up on the patio which was very cozy. I loved the open kitchen concept and seeing the pizzas cooking in the wood fire oven. We had great mimosas, an amazing Bolognese dish that they serve with all homemade pasta and local organic ingredients and also the pizza margherita which I couldn't resist seeing the oven. The staff was kind and friendly and the decor was so unique. Great new place and our favorite new local hot spot.","Been here more than a few times.  . -Service has always been good.  . -Food has always been fresh. . -Atmosphere is typical sports bar style. . -Price is reasonable (about $15 per person with drink) and happy hour drinks are fair.  . We've had the wings, pizza, calzones, California cluck, kids meals. . . all are good.","What a horrible experience! Our server quoted us 40-60 mins for a small deep dish pizza for two people and it took close to two hours. They allowed too many take out orders. . . believe me I watched everything that came out of the kitchen. So it looks like the best way to go is order take out. The deep dish pizza was good. . . better than the competition, but that awful time estimation left a bad taste in my mouth. We asked to speak to a manager and he didn't comp anything. . . not even our drinks. Very poor experience. I only recommend visiting dine in within a couple months, unless you don't mind waiting ridiculously long.","I was here couple of days ago and pizza from the pizza bar was amazing. Decided to bring the kids to try it and got nothing but disappointment. We ordered 2 pizzas. The Margherita  and the Gotham. Both tasty but very very saggy. . Not worth paying $26 for a cheese pizza and $28 for a pepperoni pizza. . Service sucks or maybe it was just our waitress. . Just get your slice at the pizza bar!!!","I run a 25+ bike ride. i stopped in a few times before to confirm our arrival on a tuesday. Honestly, i thought this place may be a bit too stuffy for our band of dirt balls and miscreants, but boy was i wrong. . They put aside an entire booth section for us, Took care of us with a happy hour special, My pizza came out when we were getting our checks. . . . FREE PIZZA. They took it off without me even having to ask. Thats customer service. . Oh yeah and the pizza. HOLY F**** its good. i got the Carvinorium. . . or something. its their all meat pizza. Im from NY so you know I'm gonna be picky. This pizza. . id give it a 9/10. I was completely floored by the quality, balance of crust to toppings. . . the grease. . . . . ohhhh the grease. . All in all, we descended upon them with 25 pizza and beer hungry monsters and NO it wasn't perfect, but they took care of us. Good customer service has nothing to do with everything being in place, its about how you handle errors and your attention to detail. Props to Revo.","Papa johns is my go-to place for pizza delivery! This location in particular has always gotten my pizza to me on time and the delivery guys have always been very friendly.","Decided to give Crawfords a try since Ive been a bit unsatisfied with my regular repair shop overcharging me. . Guess what? Ive find my new\"regular repair shop\"!. Really great honest guys working here. They got me in at my scheduled time and completed on time. They didnt try to up sell me. Gave me fair repair quotes on the things i  asked for a quote. . I stayed till repairs were done. Couch is more comfy than it looks. Oh and Brad. . . . get some lady magezines for us girls! Lol . Emberressing moment. . . . i went to pay with my debit card and it wasn't in my wallet. Ah! No really i want trying to pull a fast one. I had ordered a pizza the night before and left my card on the table. . They let me leave the shop with an ankle monitoring device. . . . . no not really, they were cool. I ran home and got the card and to their happy suprise i returned to pay. Everyones happy. :). Thanks guys! I'll be back for the other repairs.","So friendly and accommodating!   The food was great. Had thin n crispy pepperoni pizza, Italian sandwich and roaster chicken!   It was all fantastic. Restaurant was spotless and lots of tv's to watch sports!   Will definitely be back!   Service was as good as the food.","Dragon Fire is awesome! The dragon fire with the ghost pepper cheese is my favorite, with the bronze dragon being a close second. Their specialty pizzas are all really good, but with the speed of their cooking and the wood-fired oven you will get a little bit of a burnt taste. In my opinion, their regular pizzas (plain sausage, pepperoni, cheese, etc) are just average. . The service is really great. Dave and his staff are always super friendly. Like I stated previously, I love all of the specialty pizzas I've tried from them but their regular pizzas are a little too burnt-tasting for my liking.","Holy Cleveland, the antipasto salad is huge! Pizza slices waiting for you. The pizza is delicious. Tower City location is great. I am a fan!","What a find! Perfect pizza, Bloody Caesar and rose. Wine. Sitting outdoors on a sunny day under the awning was lovely. . Crispy crust, prosciutto, mozzarella, mushrooms and rocket, the perfect pie. Open brick pizza oven cooked to perfection!. Inside is very smart, well designed and great upstairs.","While in Vegas we were on a budget and as usual everything is so expensive. We found this place and it was awesome; great wings and even better pizza!! We got the cheese pizza and it was great.","I was not impressed with the Daily Planet. It was about 12:30 a. m. and I was in need of a bite to eat before heading back to the hotel. I ended up here and found it to be pretty disappointing. . We had three or more servers and I appreciate teamwork, but none of them communicated to each other to get our orders right. It was kind of bothersome, but we just wanted food. . Prices on the menu were high and I and decided on a chicken sandwich. The food took a little while and when it arrived nothing about it looked appetizing. . We ate as much of the meals as possible, but is was not worth the money, time or calories! . Next time I'll find a pizza place!","I try to come here whenever I'm in the area. They have the biggest chicken tenders for a good price and they're always piping hot when I get them. The suicide sauce is my favorite. Going to try the pizza next time I'm around. . -----. My girlfriend and I got a 14 inch meat deluxe the last time we were in. Hands down the best pizza we've ever had. The pizza was stacked with toppings. Perfectly cooked thin and crispy bacon, with a quality ground beef in there as well. Amazing crispy and flakey yet soft dough/crust. This was after a 25 minute drive back to San Tan Valley before we could eat it. The kind young man that helped us offered us plates and napkins just in case we were going to eat there. Can't wait to try some pasta next time, wish there was another location out around queen creek. They would make a killing out here with the rapidly expanding community.","Went to 3 Brewers for lunch with colleagues and was wowed by their beautiful patio. Sadly my excitement only lasted for 30 seconds before my heart was broken into tiny pieces - they could only accommodate our group inside. We spotted a few small open tables. We offered to split up. . . . anything for a spot in the sunshine. Denied again. We headed inside to the back room whose windows allowed us a nice view of the patio. That counts for something, right?. The menu had a great selection of food and drinks. I ordered a ceasar and their flatbread pizza. Fast-forward 30 minutes and we were still without drinks (or waters). Dehydration was kicking in and our server was MIA. . Our food and drinks finally showed up 40 minutes after we arrived. The food was tasty but I'm pretty sure they served us the saddest ceasars in Toronto. I mean throw in a stick of celery or something. Have some pride in your ceasar garnishes (full disclosure - I had a sip before snapping the pic). Anyway, I digress. Meal was decent. I just felt bad for my colleagues who finally got their pints 5 minutes before it was time to head back to the office.  . TL;DR:. Food was good. . Patio looked great from my indoor window seat. Saddest ceasar in the city. Service could have been better. It's lunch time in the financial district. I know it's busy, but come on. At least give us waters while we wait.","Oh, Glass Nickel. How I miss you. Ordinarily, I'm all over Glass Nickel -- they're fast, prompt, the food is good, great toppings, great variety, the works. When I realized I couldn't eat gluten, I was super excited to see that Glass Nickel offered a gluten-free crust option. . Strike #1: The gluten-free crust only comes in 10\". Still, it's a specialty item, so I can understand. . Strike #2: It costs $3 extra to get said 10\" crust. Okay, well, I guess they don't sell many of them. . . . Strike #3: The taste and the texture. Grainy, chewy in a not-good way, cardboard, soggy, flavorless. Too thin to support the pizza, even by pizza-with-lots-of-things standards. The edges were rock solid, like cardboard, and overall it was. . . severely, severely disappointing. SEVERELY disappointing. . I completely understand the challenges and issues with a gluten-free crust--I'm an avid baker and a science geek--but given that they offer a cracker crust, I see no reason why a popular restaurant can't find a good flatbread recipe and use that. . 3 stars, but only because their regular stuff is great. Truly disappointing from a gluten-free standpoint.","Stuffed mushrooms? With what? Fried mozzarella? If you like 5 pounds of cheese. Garlic pepperoni pizza. We'll lets jut say I won't be hunted by vampires any time soon. It was hard to take and we love garlic. The server was nice but Un-attentive. My boyfriend never got a 2nd beer and was never asked if he wanted one. I had to give him the rest of my Moscow mule. By the way the Moscow nuke was delicious. I guess kudos to the bar tender.","We order every time we visit Vegas. Everything we have tried was really good. We always get the cheese, the blonde on the beach, a salad with mushrooms and olives, hot wings, and a veggie pizza. They're not expensive and they use really good cheese and veggies. We really wish there was a location in Los Angeles.","Great pie! They know how to make pizza here. Crust, sauce and cheese are all done right.","Incredible food!!! I love that you can get half portion pasta dishes because sometimes a full is just too much. My boyfriend and I like to share a pizza and a half pasta and it's the perfect amount! If you like fish, I recon their swordfish. It is sooo flavorful and presented beautifully. Also, their bread is so good but (beware) once you start. . you cannot stop! Great atmosphere, great food, and great service. I always enjoy my time at Chinato.","Came here on a Friday around 6 and was seated right away. Its a cute little place and had a nice vibe. I was here with Jessie B and we ordered  a few of the small plates. Since we sat at a table we did not get HH prices. . o-well. We wanted to be comfy &amp; not sit at the bar. . So we started with crab &amp; artichoke dip. . it had real chunks of crab and was super creamy and came with toasted bread slices. . Next was the sashimi. . I know its a tapas style place but there was only 3 pieces. It was so yummy I could have eaten 3 orders!. Last was something we got talked into by our waiter who was very friendly &amp; even brought us extra ice for our sippy cup drinks we already had walking in. . We were gonna get the pizza pops but he said. . ehh. So we ended up with the crazy mac &amp; cheese flat bread. . It came with a pesto/ranchy sauce for dipping. It was soooo wierd. . I still dont kno if I loved it but it was something different for sure. . There is a very good selection of yummy small plates. . something for everyone. I love that!. And I really loved the server being so nice &amp; helpful. Thumbs up!!","I was looking to go to Vegetarian Haven but they didnt open til 5pm so I walked a few doors down and saw Cafe La Gaffe. It was 4pm on a Thursday. I asked to sit outside and eat. It was nice they have 4 tables in front. I had the Med. Pizza. It was real nice. The pizza was great, the crust was Excellent, the toppings very nice. Too much for just one person. In between the pizza slices on the plate is a very nice salad. I had water with lemon. The prices were nice too.  $15 plus tax. I put the picture up of the pizza. The street is nice and quiet enough to sit out and eat. It looked like a nice bar inside. The waitress was attentive.","Went here for dinner on Sunday evening and was very disappointed at first by two things: The price ($15. 50) and the customer service. We were practically yelled at by one of the managers that we were in the wrong line as we walked up--at the time there was no one else in the line but us, so we did not understand why she became so angry. As we continued our meal the waiters were pretty much non existent and when they were around were very tight lipped and rude. The one bright light in all of this was the food was actually good--I had the chicken noodle soup, salmon, sweet/white fish, spinach salad (added onions and cucumbers), slice of pepperoni pizza, and two small desserts (red velvet cake). They had an awesome selection of desserts--I just wish that they had the same diverse selection in their dinner items especially for the price. I do not think that I will be returning to this buffet and I do not recommend it to anyone. For the price I think that you can do much better in variety and customer service.","This is so amazing place. We went there to have couple of drinks and got good seat. Happy hour menu was also really nice specially potatoes and pepperoni pizza. . We will be back to see more Vegas sunsets.","I have the chance to frequent this establishment very often. They have the best stuff pizza I've ever had. Papa John's, Pizza Hut etc. Pale in comparison to what this little restaurante can cook up. There are all  different signature items on the menu. They also do delivery and take out if one desires. They have a very pleasant eating environment on the interior with vintage art and photos from a far gone era. The staff and chefs are amazing and should be complemented at every point of their service. We will definitely be frequenting this establishment for the long term!","Solid place to get a salad, a pizza, some pasta, or a calzone. Their Seattle Chicken Apple salad is really good. Their mac n cheese was a bit bland, but still satisfying. Great tomato soup. Next time I go, I'm getting a calzone.","The pizza is delicious and the chicken is to die for! Our waiter was awesome and even changed the TV so we could watch the game. Excellent customer service and yummy food. We will absolutely be back!","its was ok, not the best in town! hot and sour soup was great! would not order the pad thai again. but it was better than pizza! lol","Great Pizza, Good Service, Lukewarm beer. . Went there with fiance after striking out at two other places at 8PM on a Sunday. . . yes,  PM. . There are two sizes of pizza, small (12\") or large (18\"). I'm a pig and the small pizza was big enough to share. We split the Margarita which was amazing. . . no canned tomato sauce here. Pictures don't lie. Factoring in the happy hour specials and half-priced small pizzas M-F, this might be the best meal deal in Shadyside. . Our host/server was friendly and happy to seat us at any available table. It was a non-issue for us, but the table behind us sat uncleared for the better part of our visit. She  offered timely beer/water refills and the check was prompt (when requested). . Unfortunately, we weren't interested in those refills because because the beer was barely cold. I ordered a Yuengling draft and the better half opted for the B2 on special - which was decent, other than being warm. . Would come back, hopefully they fix that keg room.","The pizza is good. . . . but the wings are freaking awesome!  20 bucks for a large pie and 12 wings on Thursdays!  I always do takeout and hit the bar next for for a quick beer while the Mama and  Co do their thing.","It was a late night at work and my friend Danielle and I were super tired. . . The food was excellent especially the margherita pizza and appetizer! But what blew us away was our server \"Sean\" he was absolutely accommodating friendly and down right on top of everything and he was very friendly and enjoyed his company and most of all his remarkable service! The food is excellent! Thank you so much Sean! For making it such a great night!","After my trip to Italy, I wanted to host an event with a masquerade theme and family style dining. Having visited Scaddabush for an event earlier this year, I was impressed by the service, food and ambiance, so I contacted the General Manager of the Yonge and Gerrard location, Mark Ghopros, and outlined what I had in mind in terms of the theme, cost, menu and group size. Mark and I set up a time to meet, and we discussed what I had in mind. Mark was able to meet every single one of my requests, and I left our meeting incredibly excited about the event. . Event Details. Number of guests: 40. Location: Private room on 2nd floor. Staff: 3 staff for group of 40. Menu:. 2 types of pizza. 2 types of pasta. Pappardelle crisps. Mozzarella balls on crostini. Chicken Parmesan bites. Avocado and goat cheese bruschetta. Calamari fritti. Crispy Polenta Tots. Donut bites. How did it go?. The party was a huge success. My guests raved about the fantastic food, service and ambiance. The space was rustic and the perfect setting for our masquerade theme and family style dining goal. The food came out at perfect intervals and there was plenty of food for every guest, which can be difficult to achieve when you have sharing platters being passed around between guests. If there were guests who had not received an item - which only happened once; the staff was quick to rectify the situation. . Favorites:. I am partial to the polenta tots. Crispy on the outside and soft in the inside served with a perfectly spiced tomato sauce and cheese. It is the best thing I have had in years!. The pizzas were steaming hot and only fresh ingredients were used. I took some home and it tasted just as good for breakfast. . I couldn't believe that what I thought was fried bread was pasta! Fried pappaedelle to be exact. These crispy pieces of heaven were sweet, salty and cheesy! Very addictive!. Avocado and goat cheese bruschetta is a must! They don't skimp on avocado and goat cheese. This is a combination that works perfectly together and I wonder why you don't see it on menus more often. . In Sum. . . . . My guests were blown away by the food at Scaddabush, and since this event many of my guests have become regulars, including myself. I have returned to Scaddabush with colleagues for lunch (I work in the area), and for dinner with good friends. I definitely plan to return, especially if I am planning a large event.","The family and I are in town for Spring Training and we were looking for something low key near our Hotel. With such great reviews we pulled up at 7:30 PM on a Sunday and I expected to have to wait for a table. There was ONE other family in there eating. That should have been a sign. We were sat by a really nice, young, waitress. She took our drink order but was not very knowledge about the wines available. We ordered a house Chianti and a house Cab Sauv. The wine came out and smelled like stinky socks. The \"Anti Pasta\" was a little bit of mystery lunch meat on top of shredded iceberg. I thought the stench I was smelling was my Wine fermenting while we were there. The was a sewage smell in the air. When I went to the restroom I walked into a wall of sewage smell. It was pretty bad. That was it for me. The pizzas came out but at different times and it was actually decent but I couldn't get the sewage smell out of my nose hairs. Maybe if you went in, didn't order wine, didn't order an \"anti pasta\" didn't sit at the table closest to the bathrooms and ordered a plain cheese pizza you would like this place.","Note: Delivery only order. Great food! Fast delivery too. . . much faster than the app showed. . We loved the pizza and the wings were huge and tasted great!. Nice that the restaurant called back and suggested putting sauces on the side to keep them from getting soggy. Good call :)","After living in Arizona for 40 years we decided to try Barro's a little over a week ago. The food is so delicious we have been back four times now. The first time we went three of us tried the pasta and the other two had the pizza. Oh how delicious was our food. I am Sicilian and have always made my own sauce but I have to say their sauce on the pasta was better than mine and mine is quite delicious too. It was nice and thick and so tasty. Their meatballs are scrumptous. The pizzas are large and just perfect. Our favorite so far is the Hot Wing pizza and also the Mega meat pizza. It has bacon, ham, meatballs, pepperoni, and sausage. The other night we also tried their salads. I had a small and it was huge and tasty. Love their garlic bread that comes with the pasta too. So glad we finally tried this place. It has a very comfortable and pleasant dining room too. Highly recommend it!!","One of my favorite lunch spots in the valley. Usually go to the one on Gilbert Rd, but happen to be working in Mesa so I stopped in. . My go to sandwich is It's About Thyme. . . love the chicken with balsamic and mushrooms! Another fav is the Chile Verde Birdie. . . with extra green chili please. They always have daily specials available and lighter food options available. . They bake their own bread which is what takes there sandwiches to the next level! . The pizza is equally good!  Love this place and wish I lived closer!","Had the same experience as K. F. when we walked in. No one was there to seat us and no seemed too anxious to do so. If the food was good, we might have been able to forgive that, but it just wasn't good at all. Started w/ the fried calamari which was soggy. Both my husband and I had a pasta dish which neither of us enjoyed. Don't know if the pizza is any better, but we won't be going back to find out.","So this place i would rank in the same exact field as spinatos. This is a tough category to be in. Not quite sure what they were going for with the decor. There were/are tv's everywhere (in the family/restaurant) section of the place. I mean i won't lie i love to watch sports everywhere i go, but this is just screaming for me to get in trouble if i go with my girlfriend. . The food wasn't cheap in price, but wasn't ridiculously priced. . Lets start with the good: The pizza. The place is called upper crust they better have a good pizza. and Just like their name the crust is great. Infact it is the best part of the pizza. Yes i will admit we got a weird combination of toppings on the pizza so that probably didn't help much, but here we go. . . . The sundried tomatoes should have been slightly rehydrated before putting in the oven because. . . they were super sundried tomatoes. the cheese was good. The crust, it was a good thin crust pizza, but it didn't have enough to put it over as GREAT. To be honest if they made the crust a garlic crust or something, add a little pizzazz to it. Yeah it would have gone over better with me. . But to be honest, if you want a straight forward pizza. They got you a great straight forward pizza. . Because they are in the same category of spinatos. They are getting graded against what i would like to say the best sit down pizza THAT I HAVE PERSONALLY tried in the Phoenix area. . The specialty pizza selections um. . . , how you say. Small. . . i was expecting more of a selection on this from a place called upper crust. . We also got their stuffed mushrooms. They were good, i won't lie i don't get too picky about my stuffed mushrooms as long as they have a good tasting mushroom and is stuffed with something tasty. . I don't think they were worth the 7. 99 price tag they had on it though. . I'd come back, but i'd have to try other things to convince me of a better rating. Maybe i will go to the \"lounge/bar\" side next time. (the wings looked decent i will try those next time).","Had a great meal even though we had really rude people next to us. Great drinks as well had a $5 margarita and the bbq chicken pizza.","I spent $3 a slice on pizza that was a slice from a small Domino's pie, what a bummer. On the strip i could accept that, but on Fremont st? Get that shit out of my face. I only realized this non-sense after my buddy paid. What a bummer.","Ordered online at work to pick up on the way home, ordered at 3pm and stated to have ready by 6pm. I showed up at 6pm on the dot, waited at the register for 5 minutes until someone walked by and said they would be right with me. Waited another ten minutes and someone finally came to the register. Told him I had a 6pm pickup, he looked confused and said it would be right out. During my long visit I could hear pans falling, employees arguing and complaining. Employees looked dazed and confused and there is absolutely no leadership. at 6:43 I finally got my pizza, that's right 43 minutes standing in a hot store. . I only gave two stars because he did offer to refund my order. This was my first and last visit to Hungry Howies","We sat inside as it was a rainy day but probably would have anyways. I like how it has the family side and the 21 and older side even though there was a baby in the bar (Benjamin button)? The place has the ambience of a retro pizza place with the checkered table clothes. Our server was magnificent and had the best server personality (not too much taking but personable. We had wings, mushroom and onion pizza. The wings were phenomenal tons of meat. The pizza was alright. We would go back and check out a happy hour.","i found this place driving around for lunch and landed on a GREAT lunch deal.  2 cheese slices and medium drink for less than 5 bucks!  pizza is good as well.  thin crust and pretty similar to back home (east).  . the place has enough tables to eat there and 2 tvs.  definitely a great lunch spot for only a few bucks.  i'll be back since it's near my office.  plenty of parking although it is in a very busy parking lot.","Less than fifty dollars for a family of seven with drinks. Is a super deal. My family and I are from California therefore we do not have a Cici's nearby. . So anytime we come to Vegas we come to Cici's! The salad bar is packed with fresh veggies. The pizza options are super yummy and delish! I enjoy the variety of all the foods. . My favorite is pepperoni with stuffed crust. Filled with an abundance of cheese. Yummmmmm!","Best pizza I've had in a looong time. Reminds me of the pizza I had in Italy. I've been craving it every day since. Delicious!","Very disappointed in this place. Looked good and had good reviews by others but tried it. Don't waste your money. We started with Garlic Knots because they were recommended. Very doughy and tasteless. The manager took them off the table and brought out their standard \"peasant bread\" another loser. Nothing special at all. At an Italian restaurant you expect to have excellent crusty Italian bread with that special flavor. Their table bread is not worth the calories. My wife ordered Chicken Parm and I tried a pizza. Again both dishes very disappointing. Chicken Parm was dry. Not at all what you would expect from the price and ambiance of the place. She couldn't eat much of it. The spaghetti side over-cooked, heavy and doughy tasting. I don't really understand why people rave about the spaghetti at this place. The Pizza was awful. They are not using hard wheat (Semolina) which gives Pizza dough that unique taste. It appears they are using regular flour or very inferior ingredients. We won't be going back. I would strongly advise not to waste your money on this place. I'm frankly surprised where their reputation comes from. Looks can deceive I guess.","We have been going to Nellos for years. Last night the hubby and I went for date night. We started off with the Eggplant \"brushetta\" . The toppings were heavy and the bread soggy. While tasty it was definitely NOT brushetta worthy. Rename it to Eggplant Cheesy Bread and then you will get what you expect. We also ordered the Spring salad with the house Balsamic. It was delicious!!  Nellos makes the best house dressing and this was equally as yummy as the original. We each order our own pizza. Hubby loved his pan crust Skinny. I being a creature of habit ordered what I ALWAYS get, the thin crust wheat spinach pie. Here is why I only gave three stars. . . I think they must have a new chef. The pizza was soggy and I had to get a magnify glass out to find any feta. . . Oh no!! The main ingredient I was craving!  :( I voiced my complaint to our very attentive and friendly waiter Zach. He had them make another. I requested it To Go  as by then hubby had finished his meal. Unfortunately the second pizza was the same as the first. I will probably go back because the salads are just so wonderful but unfortunately my favorite pizza is no longer an option I will take a risk on again. So disappointed after craving it all day!","Pizza  by the slice lunch specials are always a bonus! . And, when the pizza is tasty, that makes it even better. . Only about 8 tables if eating in, but saw a lot of take away orders while eating in. . A good choice for a quick and inexpensive lunch. . 2 slices and a drink for $6. . Due to the close high school, they get slammed some days. . .","To me is more like a 3. 5 stars. The only reason why I chose 3* is because I find the menu doesn't offer nothing else that could make you explore a Japanese dining experience. Only sushi and very few sushi pizza and soups. . However, place is clean and staff is very friendly. Sushi chef and staff are all Japanese and not Chinese or any other region from Asia. . They offer dine in or take away service but not delivery. . Business hours are pretty much the same as other places with the exception of Saturday. . Mon - Fri: 11. 30 am to 10. 00 pm. Sat: 12. 0 pm to 9. 30 pm. Sun: closed. Sushi is pretty good, fresh and served fairly quickly. The service is prompt and very friendly. . So, overall, if you are in the neighbourhood and you crave for sushi, this is a safe bet for good sushi for a fair price if compared to the only 2-3 only options available in LV.","We went here before catching a show at the Linq. . It was a perfect night to sit out side, and give this little spot a try. . LOVED IT! It was fantastic. The food was great, the service was even better. . We loved the Calamari Fritto with fried peppers. Caprese salad was awesome!. Our pizzaz were perfect. Thin light crust, and still full of flavor!. I would sit down here gain in a second! We all had a great meal, and a lot of fun!","Oh my! How sad. . I've been coming here for 7+ years. . This time, as well the last time (last year), the pizza is horrible. Quality went WAY down hill. . . Too bad. . So, this is my RIP review.  . I don't expect it to get better again, as it's been two years of substandard now :(  Bummer. . Oh well, so many other places to go . . . . it was good while it lasted. . .","I stopped by here this past Tuesday for dinner with my wife. It had been a long time since I was last at Aiellos and my wife and I ended accidentally walking past it before doubling back and finally finding it. The inside of Aiellos is currently under construction but they have a counter in the front and the a seating area with a bunch of lunch table like booths in the back. At Aiello's you order at the counter, grab your drink from one of the coolers and then pay as you leave. For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to split an extra large (18\") cheese pizza. We ended up waiting about 20 minutes from ordering until our food was ready. This pizza like all pizzas can be broken down into its three major components: crust, sauce and cheese. Of the three I think that the crust was my favorite at Aiello's. I would consider it to be a thin crust pizza with a nice crisp bottom and the crust actually reminded me of a baguette, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. My second favorite part of the pizza was the sauce which had a little sweetness at the first which was followed by a nice herby flavor. Last but not least is the cheese which was decent also. There was enough of it to cover the pie but not an excess of it. . The bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't head back to Aiello's again in the future. With the generally good review I probably have you scratching my head over that and while I will say that the pizza was pretty good, at $25 for a cheese pizza, I just think it costs way too much.","Ahhh, Flancer's Cafe. You're filled with cute boys who serve me. You offer a bunch of tasty sandwiches that become two meals for me because they are so large. And apparently, you have amazing pizza. Hurrah. . I tried the \"No Bones About it\" (All the food has cute names!) sandwich, which is Boneless Buffalo Chicken with lettuce, tomato, onion, and cheddar. It comes on amazing bread. The kind that is slightly crisp on the outside and delightfully soft on the inside, but with substance. None of that wonderbread crap. It's a huge sandwich - which is about $7. 50 if I'm remembering correctly. They'll turn the sandwich into a \"meal combo\" for four additional dollars, which would include a fountain drink and a side like fries or soup or potato salad. However, I recommend sharing a large fry with a friend if you go, because that's only like $2. 50 or something.  (I tend to just drink water so it would make my bill cheaper. . . . I dunno about yours haha). The staff is prompt, friendly and funny. A nice little place down the street from my parents house =)","Don't let them fool you about the size of the pizza. I'm beginning to wonder if they try to make you think it's on the small size so you order an appetizer. We ordered the Gotham pizza, lots of yummy protein and what not. But we started with the chopped salad (also very yummy) and then came the pizza. Rolled out pretty content.","It's about the same as it is in chgo. Nothing special but it's closer to home so I tried it. Employees seem to have gotten their act together and were friendly. It's obvious this is no Lou Malnati's before you even walk in the door. Not even open a month and more than 1/2 empty at lunch. . Probably the best part was hearing the guys at the bar far more impressed with the bathroom hand dryer system than the pizza.","An evening at Altar Bar with the Swedish power metal paladins known as Sabaton was brewing. I had planned to stop by Bar Marco for a quick dinner, but foolishly enough, I assumed that they were open on Mondays. That's when I glimpsed an establishment that signaled me with glowing Italian colors not even the approaching dusk could obscure. Implicitly promising quality pizza, Bella Notte delivered magnanimously. . All I wanted was a doublet of cuts, unaware that they would be canyon-wide in size and carry a savory wallop. . The Margarita pizza wedges held a fragile, alabaster mozzarella that almost resembled lace yet tasted like manna, and hid juicy, blistering, vine-fresh tomatoes. The sauce was thick, pasty, but not without a bit of rustic chunk. Moss-green feathers of basil decorated each parsley-speckled slice like sashes on a soldier. The crust, embedded with what appeared to be sesame seeds came off as an ancient wonder, the kind conceived via a clandestine process that has been passed down by family elders since time immemorial. Possessive of olden oven essence, the flat of each piece was pliable and as slender as a rapier while the bulky, brittle outer crusts were carbonized beauty, the ends of both crackling as my teeth made contact. A procession of fruit, curd, bread, leaves, and. . . soot led to silkiness, heartiness, earthiness, pungency, urgency, vaporosity. . . Brimstone: Such was this communion. . My eyes and mouth were agape when the commanding, calescent triangles of dough, dairy, vegetable, and herb were set before me. When I finished the second, I made eye contact with the server and the owner and shot my thumbs upward. . However, I'd like to thank a fat, toadish, drunken deadbeat for ruining the moment by making the waitress cry and causing the owner to deservedly cuss out said dipsomaniac and toss him out, making for an unpleasant scene. The man we'll call \"Otis\" thought he should only have to pay $2. 91 instead of $3. 21 because he \"comes here all the time\" and \"knows that a piece 'o pizza here ain't no $3. 21. \". Uh, yeah. If you're reading this, buddy, be glad I didn't slam your corpulent and obviously well-fed and bathed ass onto the sidewalk. Remember, assault and battery laws protect your ilk from so many thumpings. . Then again, I'm sure he's looking at porn right now if he's even conscious. . I hope you enjoy your hangover, asshole, and are tortured by nausea, diarrhea, and a pummeling migraine. . THIS is why I almost always tip servers 20%, and in this case, I tipped a little more. . P. S. For two big portions of gourmet pizza and a soft drink, my total was just $10 and some change. One slice would have easily  been enough for dinner. . P. P. S. I'm sorry for the rant. . P. P. P. S. Now to address some of the stranger reviews: . If Bella Notte is a \"tourist trap, \" then how'd I get reeled in? I've never before heard of people coming to Pittsburgh just to try Bella Notte. . The service: It was fine, friendly, and not at all \"poor\" on my end. I unknowingly came in 30 minutes before closing, was treated well, and was still in and out before the clock struck 7. My pizza slices were ready before I had time to think, so there was nothing slow about the service as far as I could tell. . I also saw a credit card machine but happened to have more than enough cash on me. Did they just get one?","Wednesday, early evening, I was excited to visit the new Giordano's in Peoria since it was Chicago style pizza. . . I'm thinking a west side version of Lou Malnati's. Nope, not that at all. We drove several times around the small parking lot until a space freed up. We were seated in a reasonable amount of time in a hallway between the kitchen and the restaurant seating. And that was it. We waited 15-20 minutes without the slightest acknowledgement. Employees were going up and down the aisle but they wouldn't even slow down for us to get their attention and there were LOTS of employees, mostly just standing around in the corners of the restaurant. I understand that they've been open only a couple of weeks but come on. This place needs management. We walked out. . . that didn't get any attention either. . I gave them two stars giving them the benefit of the doubt that I would like the pizza had I been able to taste it.","Ordered their pizza and the price is insanely high for what you get. For $36 got two personalized pizzas. It wasn't that great anyway. Do yourself a favor and save the money and go get two $5 store freezer pizzas if you want something comparable.","This is the best Pizza and Lasagna around. Hands down. The staff does a good job of preparing your order for in house or to go. The pizza crust has that right amount of pull and snap a good slice of pie must have. The marinara sauce is excellent. Ingredients are first class. Nice dining area inside. First class. New York to the dough.","We thought this place was the same as Manhattan Pizza on Craig. We were wrong. We understand we ordered on a football Sunday, but the pizza was not good, and later than what their website said. The crust was chewy, tough to cut and bite through. The delivery driver obviously had the pizza tilted because the cheese ran into one corner of the box. We thought about taking it back, but decided to give it a try. This will be the last time we order from here.","Pros. Quality ingredients. Cheese and sauce on pizza were good. Salad ingredients were crisp and very fresh and tasty. . Wings are a stand out. . Service was good, not the best. Young servers who seemed like genuinely nice people. . Good draft beer selection. . Cons . Expensive for pizza. . A small one topping was 15. 99. Not that big. My self and my 4. 5 yo ate it all and we're both hungry. Keep in mind I normally eat a max of 3 pieces and I'm stuffed of a heartier pizza.  . Dough was neutral. A papery taste . Salad was expensive for a side salad too. $6 and change. Plus $2. 99 for added cheese. . Server said it was good for 2 people but it's just a regular size salad. Overall. I would come back for sure. But not in my regular rotation. Once a year or so.  . Pizza was a thinner crust. Not thinnest but not normal pizza thickness. I prefer a heartier pizza.","*Thumbs up*. The pizza is fine -- nothing memorable. The crust isn't thin, nor thick, just in between. It's not particularly cheesy, either. If you're too lazy to walk and craving some late night grub to sober up, then the pizza will satisfy your stomach. I used my MyVegas rewards, so I got 3 slices for free. . *Thumbs down*. Your better off walking the extra 10-15 minutes next door to Cosmo. Secret Pizza.","I was originally going to order Chinese but decided on pizza at the last minute. After being in an acute care facility for 28 days I deserved a treat. Calling and ordering was a breeze and the delivery (for one in the morning) was fast. That deserved a $5. 00 but I wish i would have asked for some plates or thick napkins. Found a new place to order from - now all I have to do is talk them into having a family special or family freak feast!. If you are ordering this to be delivered to a work address or other institutional facility, never fear, the driver I had tonight called twice - once when leave the shop and one when he arrived here","I've been to the original nook a few times and liked it, so you can imagine that I was excited for a location to open closer to my neighborhood. The decor of this location is very inviting and modern. A friend and I came late ish at night and split their calabrese pizza with the sausage and caramelized onions. . . . so good! If definitely come back!","I will definitely order from here from now on. I was impressed with the overall outcome. The delivery time was great, about 30 mins. Delivery boy was very courteous. I paid through Yelp and it was all very easy. My total for my order (everything below) was the same price as Papa Johns except much better, better options, included tip and got twice as much. . so way better deal!. Ordered:. Pepperoni pizza - it was ok. Flavor was good, but cheese slipped off a little. Not greasy!. Margarita pizza - I enjoyed this very much. It had a good amount of flavor, uniquely made, and very light feeling. . Chicken/white sauce pizza - also very good, included some of my own additions. Very simple to do. Cheesecake - thumbs up!. Moose cake - I didn't care for, but my daughter did!","Fantastic Italian food in Gastonia. Menu is great and prices are as well. I'd recommend the mini pizza with three toppings- and going in for lunch. I had eggplant parmigiana along with bread and a salad. The eggplant was fantastic along with the homemade ranch dressing. I'll be back.","My fianc\u00e9 and I frequent Vegas often, we usually stay at the Rio and spend a lot of time in the Sports book watching football, so as you can imagine we spend a lot of meals in the sports book as well. The sports  deli is conveniently located right next to the sports book and offers a great variety of 'sports watching' foods. You can choose from chicken noodle soup, to a variety of sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, and their salads are huge portions and are totally delicious and fresh! If you're in the mood for  it they also have a few baked goods to offer and either pizza by the slice or whole pizzas for sale. My favorite item here has to be their garlic fries, they serve the big steak fries and load em up with garlic goodness!!! There's usually a line but it's worth the wait cause it's good fresh food, and if you're lucky you'll get Richard making your meal, he's the main man that runs the place. He always take care of my boyfriend and my meals, and they've always been wonderful! Try it out yourself!","This is awesome pizza, period. For a gal who doesn't really care for pizza (there is only one other pizza in town that I like) this place is great!!. My husband and I met our friend there for lunch last week. . . he loved it, we loved it. We will all be back!!. The staff is friendly and helpful, the store is clean and well kept. . Lots of toppings, pizza comes out hot and tasty from the wood-fired oven super fast!. YUM!!","For the money, there is no better pizza in Las Vegas. Sure, Settebello and Dom DeMarco's might make a better pie, but both are pricier and take longer. I actually think Custom Built is better than Due Forni. Highly recommended.","We came in for lunch right after they opened  (around 11:45). Staff was pretty friendly and the atmosphere was warm. Our server was short with us even though im pretty sure we were the only ones in the section. We ordered a pizza with sausage, meatballs, sweet peppers, and ricotta cheese. The pizza was good, i expected to be wowed after reading some of the other good reviews. We did feel a but rushed though, i didnt even finish my first piece of pizza by the time our server brought the check to our table. All in all it was good, and im glad i tried it to see what the fuss was about, but i don't think I'll be rushing back anytime soon.","Worst Mike  manager's customer service ever! I been placing orders for the last few months and today I found out my pizza price was $16. 70 instead as $14. 95 as stated on websites,  I called and I asked why it was a different price, she couldn't answer my question and said \" I will transfer you to my manager\", Mike couldn't answer the reason why just said, \"this is what the system said\", I explained I been getting the same price since I started ordering a few months ago, as well I also explained him that his  website stated it is $14. 95 for the 14\", he said \"it might be the season or it is what it is\", what do you want? \" I expressed my concerns but he didn't care at all. He keep saying , it is what it is\", maybe our website is wrong. . I feel terrible offended for a very rude manager, his customer service is awful! For a minimum and less then 2 dollars he treated me awful! And probably loose one of his repeatedly customers forever. . Awful service from the MANAGER MIKE!","Really yummy pizza! The service was really friendly too. They helped my cousin and I find good clubs to go to and even gave us a site to sign ourselves up for free guest lists.","We had cheesy bread, shrimp pizza and meat pizza. . All really good. Toppings were good. Cheese to sauce ratio was consistent. Service was good.","I don't have experience with deep dish pizza, but other reviewers seem to be suggesting this is not the Chicago real deal. . I ordered for delivery. It's all the ingredients of pizza, and somehow really just not any of the goodness and satisfaction of pizza : (. I rarely post negative reviews, but this was pretty disappointing. Ingredients seemed low quality and it was merely lukewarm on delivery. Maybe it was a bad day. I may try again. . .","Del Forno is AMAZING! The atmosphere is really nice and looks like it would be fun in the evening. Our waitress was super sweet and hilarious! While we were waiting for our food the chef sent out a little appetizer for us to try. It was dough with nuts, cheese, and honey- sounds weird, but tasted soooo good!! We got a margarita pizza which was superb. The chef included fresh parmesan with it and it was a great addition. Our food was so good that we talked to the chef personally to thank him! I wish I could give more than 5 stars! We'll be regulars for years to come!","I visit Vegas around 6 times a year from LA. This has become a must stop for the wife and I when we go. It's great power food for drinking and gambling. Not only is their pizza really good, but they have some pretty awesome drink combos (like a beer and whisky shot).","Love coming here and making my own personalized pizza! The ingredients are on point, I love their tomato sauce, and the specialty pizzas are amazing! Especially their pesto and fig &amp; prosciutto  their bruschetta is my favorite, the topping selection great and a trio of those are a meal themselves. I've had their specialty cocktails like the lake pleasant and it was different and good!","There are certain things I love at Lucille. Things I love: . 1) Cheese Curds. 2) Black Garlic &amp; Mushroom \"BGM\" Wood-Fired Pizza. 3) Potato Wood-Fired Pizza. 4) Bar downstairs in the bank vault. Things I don't love:. 1) The wait and service. 2) The price tag on the pizzas. Lucille has some pretty delicious pizzas and some that are not as good (the White Wedding was unimpressive). The service is also painfully slow. I came here for lunch one Wednesday and the restaurant was completely empty and it took our table forever to get our pizzas and the bill. Our lunch took over an hour because service was slow. Come here on a Friday or Saturday night and be prepared to wait over an hour to be seated.","Love the whole subway concept for pizza. I don't know whats better the pizza or the price!","They are rated fairly high, but pizza is not their forte. . . Angelina's is way better! The crust was meh, and extra cheese did not make me feel cheesy. . It was a delivery order, and it was delivered fairly quickly.","Although this is a very old Hotel in Vegas, I still love it. The rooms could be better looking, but its an old hotel lol. I love the pizza spot they have there, its really good and inexpensive. Customer service is on point too. The pool is great and they play good music too.","Ohhhregahhhhhhnohhhhhssss!  That's how the name should be on the front of this Oregano's because it's pure Chicago style pizza ecstasy up in here. . We tried this location today because we were TCB that took us to the Maricopa area. In contrast to the Scottsdale locations, this spot is relatively new, great parking, and wasn't nearly as busy. . Arrived around noon and were seated immediately. Everything was fresh and delicious, even tastier than Scottsdale - the iced tea is somehow better at this location too.","After looking for somewhere to eat on a Saturday night and not having any luck we ran into TNT dynamite Pizza. The parking lot was pretty busy so we figured it must be good. We put our order in and was told it would be 30 minutes. However, after about 20 minutes our food was ready! We tried the pepperoni pizza and the Buffalo chicken rolls. They were both very good! I think that I will get the pizza with extra cheese next time but that is only because I like my pizza really cheesy. The crust was very good but was thin crust. I love thin crust but just wanted to share that in the review. The sauce was good too and there was just the right amount. . The buffalo chicken rolls were good as well and come with ranch dressing. They were had just the right amount of heat kick to them do that you could enjoy the buffalo flavor. . Will definitely go there again. Might try the Italian hoagie next time as I heard they are really good.","I wanted to try this place out &amp; I saw they had a coupon on here. I had a lot of trouble finding it yesterday because they didn't have a visible sign &amp; their listed phone number went straight to voicemail. I came back today after confirming the address, &amp; it is indeed exactly where the address says on here. They've only been at this location for a short while. I got really confused from the pictures on here of their old location. It is next to a pizza restaurant.  . The owner is very kind. I left with 4 cupcakes. They were all good quality cupcakes. The confetti vanilla was my favorite. Really moist cake &amp; not too sweet. The strawberry and red velvet were yummy, but a little too sweet for my family &amp; I. . It would also be nice if they had some cupcake holders in their boxes. Even if I was holding the box, they rolled all over the place in the car and the different frostings collided with one another. Other than that, I'll most likely return.","Went there while I was on vacation in the area, saw good reviews in here. . When we arrived, the restaurant was empty, but shortly after we arrived, a group of 9 arrived. There was only 1 waitress and one cook, so service was very slow because of that. . Overall, the food was pretry good. We all had pizzas. I had the Red Roasted Peppers one, but I was deceived, since there were not a lot of peppers on my pizza. My pizza was also slightly uncooked and the taste of garlic was way too present. My husband had the Oregano mix pizza and it was good. My daughter had the Oregano basic pizza and it was also very good. . There is no kids menu there, so you either have to share or order a regular item on the menu. Prices are good, around 13$-16$ per  meal.","This location is a new addition to the neighbourhood. I have to say I was pretty excited when I saw that they were opening up. Definitely a welcome addition to Leslieville. . The pizza is pretty standard and on par with all the other Pizzaiolo locations I have eaten at.  . They have a really good walk-in special for a 2 topping XL pizza for $18. The nice thing is that it's actually a true extra large and you get a TON of 'zza for your money. Took about 20 minutes for my walk-in order to prepared and the end result was very tasty. . They're good competition for the average (at best) Pizza Pizza down the street. I only wish they had a deep dish offering.","I hadn't heard of Nello's until recently and it is now my favorite restaurant in the valley! Awesome pizza and the house dressing is equally as good. Great service most of the time and I need to try their happy hour soon.","This is my fav spot in Monroeville to eat. The pizza is great and the salad is awesome. Easy to eat with a group at here.","De-lic-opus!  Brought back memories of eating at the original Grimaldi's location at the foot of the Brooklyn bridge with our sweet granddaughter on her 12th birthday trip to NYC. Great memories. . . great pizza!!!!  Thank you Grimaldi's.","I will not be going back. I was looking forward to something different than we have in Gilbert and it was. . . blek. . The waitress was annoyed to service us. The pizza - not disgusting, but nothing stands out. The Margareta pizza didn't even have tomatoes. Their sauce tasted like it was poured right from a can. The lasagna had mushy soggy noodles and the same bland-from-a-can sauce. Not worth the money at all!","Best Italian Hoagies anywhere!! Delivery is fast. Prices are great. We got tired of Adrian's and Vocelli's and one slice of meat on their hoagies. Haven't had their pizza, but the hoagies are great!","My first visit here was during YYC Hot Chocolate Fest. They had one of the winning hot chocolates. I stopped in, sat at the bar and partook in their wine infused hot chocolate, a glass of wine and some of the Scodellina. . This building used to be a video place and they've done a great job remodeling. My recent visit had us seated on the patio (lovely and very private) for lunch and a business meeting. Not having a big appetite on hot days, two of us ordered the lunch special. Pizza, salad and a scodellina. It was all very good and the right size for a lighter lunch. . A fun place to experience, with good food. They are also family friendly and I can't wait to bring the family in for pizza one night.","I have tried to find NY pizza on the west coast this is it! The two of us ate an entire Large pizza and a small Mediterranean salad to share. I'm still dreaming of this pizza. I can't wait to go back.","Can't give this place good enough praise. This is a beer lovers dream- and I know people say that but this is coming from a true beer lover. They have hundreds of bottles for sale from all over. The food is great and selection is also good for bar food like pizza and burgers and hot dogs really shine.","Food and service was excellent. We had pizza and lasagna and enjoyed both. Great sauce on the lasagna and fresh pasta. Pizza toppings were quality and fresh and crust was awesome. Good portion sizes too. Highly recommended.","Quand ce resto a ouvert je ne me g\u00eanais pas pour dire qu'ils avaient la meilleure pizza en ville. A la fois delicate pour sa p\u00e2te mais g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse en garniture fra\u00eeche et recherch\u00e9e . J'y retourne derni\u00e8rement avec des amies et sans dire que c'\u00e9tait mauvais, je n'ai pas retrouv\u00e9e la satisfaction de jadis. J'ai mang\u00e9 les boulettes de veau en entr\u00e9e, bonnes sans plus et ma pizza \u00e9tait de p\u00e2te mouill\u00e9e et pauvre en garniture. Tellement de choix maintenant que ce ne sera plus un endroit que je vais conseiller. Par contre les prix sont raisonnables. .","Have driven past Picea997 a number of times and always said 'need to come by. . soon\". . . soon came yesterday. . The place is very comfortable, loved the colors, being able to see the pizza oven as soon as you come in, the bar to the left. . . very nice! Five stars for the great reno. . The food was good, with a a couple of buts to share here:. 1. The cold cuts/cheese/warm olives dish was good, the olives were 'amazing' really, the meat and cheese hit the spot with me. . BUT the crostinis (2) were a disappointment. . Sorry guys! this appetizer was so amazing. . . until I took the first bite of the 'crostini' (cold - like it got just pulled from the fridge, it was chewy, and only two pieces - for the amount on cold meats and cheese, two crostini pieces were not enough). . The warm olives get 5 Stars though!!! . I will try this appetizer again and hope the 'crostini' is crunchy, or warm, or simply better. . 2. The arugula salad with the lemon dressing was a success with me. Loved it! . Right size, right flavor. Will have it again. . 3. The pizza (Margarita): Always try this pizza as my first test. . . . well. . . . LOVED IT!!!. The crust was perfect for me, the edges were done just right, it was light on the cheese side (my preference) and the best part. . . the sauce, OMG!!!! Not too much, not too little, it was just right. . BUT (yes another but), it didn't have enough fresh basil leaves for my liking. Will try it again and see if it has been improved. . Kept looking around and all the plates other tables were having. Definitively need to go back and try: the meat ball, the eggplant, the daily soup, other pizza's. . . . and need to leave some space for dessert. . The service was great, friendly and we were served promptly. . I was leaning towards a Four Star here, but I can't . . . . . . I will need to give this place a try again.","Great pizza and ranch! Friendly quick delivery normally there before the 45 minutes they give you. It's our go to! Order a Hawaiian with jalape\u00f1os and onions!!! You won't be disappointed.","Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. . Where do I start? We chose this place because it sounded fun; and at the time, it was new enough that there weren't too many reviews online. To start off, the concept of snookball is a LOT less fun than it looks or sounds. The game can get pretty dull pretty fast; however, I am aware that this is a subjective opinion. Nonetheless, the snook \"tables\" themselves are not well constructed and balls tend to roll off in one direction or the other depending on where the table slants. The tables are also poorly placed in relation to the bar where you place your drinks or eat while playing. Inevitably, someone will kick a ball into the bar, knocking over your drinks. We saw this happen at our table at least twice; and at the other guests tables as well on more than one occasion.  . The food at Baller's Bistro is seriously below mediocre. We even had to send one item back to the kitchen. Anyone who thinks the food there is good probably doesn't get out a lot. For starts, everything we ordered showed up at the table cold. The flat bread Margherita pizza was a sad, deeply underwhelming and bland little thing that tasted like someone put it together in their dorm room in a hurry. A tiny cold bowl of poutine will run you $7. 00 and arrives with neither the \"ample amounts of cheese curds\" or the \"rich gravy\" as described in the menu. I have eaten better food at Cineplex.      . Lastly the service is just horrible. The wait staff are slow and painfully inexperienced. And when the bill arrived, we were charged $68 + tax + gratuity for the table which is the VIP pricing with a private room. We did NOT have a private room that night (normal rate is $58 + tax) and when we pointed this out to the staff they casually informed up that the \"rates had gone up\". This was confusing because my friend had booked the room at the $58 rate (over the phone) quite sometime in advance. After we pointed out to the staff that even their website currently does not reflect any change in rates, they begrudgingly changed our bill back to the $58 rate. As for the gratuity on the room. . . I'm not so sure that that should be added on automatically. Not everyone continues to order food while at the tables; and even so, none of the wait staff actually wait on you anyways. . Someone asked me if it would be better to visit Baller's Bistro after they've had some time to get their act together. I expect they will go out of business before they get the chance.","K well came here with hubby he was playing in a tournament. Well first of all the good things about this casino is the slots are new. The casino is really busy which is also a good sign. Bad news is there is food at only 3 places. So unless u like pizza, hot dogs or any other greasy garbage this is your place. In Detroit my hometown the casino provides coffee, soda, and water as complimentary. Here u can literally die of thirst. No one offers water and I have been here for two days and not one drinking fountain. So I'm not impressed with this place at all. If u can't even be comfortable playing what's the point.","We were visiting from out of town and like to \"eat local\". There were only 4 other tables when we arrived and 5 or 6 staff standing around we waited 15-20 minutes after being seated before anyone came by. I was brought the wrong beverage the large Cesar salad came with 1 garlic knot for two of us and the pizza was just ok. I would not normally leave a yelp but the service was really shameful we won't be back this trip or any other.","Very good pizza, love that its not dripping in grease, crust is amazing and the prices are great for families.","Yuck. . . . had pizza delivered and was hard like cardboard, cold and very very salty. This place is hit and miss and nothing is consistent. . . Go somewhere else for pizza. . This pizza is yucky. . . .","This restaurant was amazing the pizza was delicious!  The fresh basil on it was the best. The staff very friendly and accommodating.","The pizza at Five50 is awesome! Nestled in Aria casino section, this place is a sports bar with a casual environment. They have awesome shakes too!!!","Had pizza, wings, and bread delivered to our hotel. Food came fast and hot. Only complaint, which is a BIG complaint, NO plates or napkins. Guess they thought we had are own in our suitcases.","The garlic knots at this place are a work of art!!!  They are served in a bed of garlic butter, so good!!!!  The service is good as well, not to mention the pizza is always delicious and authentic thin crust type with yummy sauce. No go here for lunch a lot and they also have great lunch specials!  A+++","Really nice place to eat pizza. Friendly staff, very knowledgeable. Atmosphere is very relaxing. Pizza is very good. But this place can get pricey. I will be coming back with family and friends.","Space and location is great - came in early evening with a group of 3 friends-  was easy to get a reservation and it looked like most people in the restaurant just walked in off the street. . . so if you're around West Queen West or Parkdale. . . this may be a safe bet for a place to not worry about getting a seat. . Menu is fairly priced with most pizzas coming in around 13$ or 14$. Wine prices from 34$-70$ and a limited selection (available by the glass also). . The choice and size of the pizzas is quite large - more than 15 types with something for everyone. . Our group of four had a pizza each, but probably could have sufficed with 3. The pizzas were all quite cheesy (maybe too cheesy?) but that's just a style thing, I guess. . Tried the spicy salami, the sausage and mushroom, and the carbonara pizza. They were all OK and made better with their house-chilli oil but these days I'm comparing everything to Libretto, and maybe that's a problem.","There are plenty of Gionino's in OHIO. It is our favorite pizza. Glad to have found one down in Rock Hill. Really tastes good. It takes us 40 minutes round trip to pick it up, but it is definitely worth it.","Not to long ago we noticed this place was under new management. . Since we had liked the place once upon a time, we decided to stop in again on a Saturday afternoon, with the kids, to see what was new and grab a bite for dinner. . Great service. . . a good start. The kids shared some chili chicken tenders without the chili (they were good little bites) and some crispy fries. Hubs &amp; I had some wings (very tasty), he had the steak sandwich and I the chicken club. Holy big platters batman. So much food came out and my chicken club had two breasts in it. All delicious and well worth the visit. . These guys also participated in YYC Pizza Week and I stopped in one night to try their pizza week pizza. Same waitress as before (so same great service) and the pizza was fresh &amp; delicious. . Nice to see the place picking up both in service and food. Definitely a place we will visit again.","What a gem! Tucked away between two office buildings off King is Mangia &amp; Bevi. Make sure you try their weekly specials too - the best pizza I have ever had in the city was here (a white pizza with figs, walnuts, Gorgonzola, and honey). . How can a place that makes their sausage in house be wrong?","Sad to have to update my review on this place. . . . HUGE decline since this past Summer. No longer our favorite local pizza place. The pizza does not taste or look the same, even though they said it hasn't changed. My mouth and eyes tell me otherwise. . Also, the service has went dooooooown. Like, into the gutter. A few weeks ago, we stopped on the way home to get a pie. I rang the doorbell THREE times. I saw two people in the back, but no one came, so we left. This weekend, we thought we'd order, but they didn't answer their phone. . That was probably our last attempt for Ohio City Pizza. If you guys get it together over there, let us know.","Get the walk-in special Pan Pizza with double cheese. Delicious. Tastes very similar to Pizza Hut pan pizza, but half the price.","Just a standard Italian place with standard Italian food. Dropped by here because Libretto was full and we wanted some pizza. . Pizza here was alright. Instead of the normal circular pizzas, they like to do their pizza in a rectangle. I don't really prefer this because you end up with 4 corner pieces haha which no one ever wants to eat. . Tried the fresh mozzarella which was great, and came with some oiled bread and salt and marinara sauce. It was around $13 for one ball that would feed around 4 people. . Also tried their \"famous\" giant meatball. . which was only ok and way overpriced at $13 for one meatball which the server described as \"the size of a baseball\". It was definitely smaller than that. . Overall, it was just standard Italian food and I can't say I recommend it nor stay away. If you are looking for something to eat and have no other options then it's not too bad.","On October 24 2015, my wife and I went to Mama Ginas for the third time. This time we had mild wing's and a meat lover's pizza. As usual, the food and service was top notch.","We recently had my daughter's birthday party here, and I was blown away. Initially, it was a little chaotic, trying to sort out the shoe situation, but once the kids had their correct shoes, they started bowling and had a blast!  Every member of the staff from Melisa (the event manager) to Michael (our server) to the mechanics and servers and support staff we met truly provided excellence in customer service. They all really wanted to make sure we were happy and having fun!  Melisa went out of her way to be accommodating with me and making it special for our birthday girl. I loved that her primary concern was that my daughter had a great time. She was so pleasant to work with!. The pizza was really good!  I mean, when I think of bowling alleys I typically don't think of great pizza. I remember greasy triangles where the cheese slides off the slice. But this was high quality- we will probably return for the pizza very soon!. One tip I would have for you is be aware that if you have small children, the mini golf area might be a little frightening (we lost a few golfers that way) but the kids seemed to really enjoy it!. Overall, we were told several times over this place was the best party they had been to in a long while. Our guests loved it, we loved it. We are already looking forward to our next visit!","Grabbed the Chicken Tikka Masala. Pretty average in my estimation. Naan was probably the highlight. Odd though; they sold pizza at the counter.","House sitting on the west side of town recently, I found myself searching Yelp for dinner suggestions. When it came to Novanto you, dear yelpers, said the magic word: cannoli. . I ordered a pizza and cannoli to go. The staff were friendly, willing to substitute ingredients, and service was fast!  Pizza was good, but not my favorite in Madison. The crust was a bit too chewy and toppings were a little sparse though fresh tasting. The cannoli was, as promised, delightful.","I've had their pizza a half-dozen times, pick up and delivery, and I like it! I'm no pizza expert, but it was good and cheap. Feta on top = yum.","I'm a NYer who knows good pizza and gave up on finding a slice in AZ that reminds me of Johns Best on Bleeker Street. I recently needed a quick lunch and spontaneously stopped into Rustic Pizza for a slice. I can truly say that anyone who knows authentic pizza will love the large single slice, gooey cheese, crisp crust and great sauce, just like the best pizza in the Big Apple. The service was quick and friendly and the only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I need to go back and try other things besides the yummy pizza. Try it!","Lil' Baci is decidedly Italian, from the perfect pronunciation of the menu items to the beverage choices (Brio, Orangina, San Pellegrino). FYI they do not offer iced tea. . Our server, Justin, was cheerful and outgoing, bordering on overbearing at times. I suppose it's a nice change of pace from the snobbery one endures at other Italian restaurants in the city, but I couldn't but think that such a gregarious person might be better suited working in a children's restaurant, say Chuck E Cheese. He was so chatty he practically sat down with us and joined in on our meal. ***. I ordered the Quatro Formaggio pizza ($13. 95) with gorgonzola, mozzarella, provolone, parmagiano and fresh basil. In the \"true Italian style\" your pizza does not come pre-sliced. You have to \"ask for help\" (am I a kid??) but luckily Justin was happy to oblige. I'm sure he would have hand-fed it to me had I asked. . Skip the spinach and lemon gnocchi. . After dinner we had to indulge in two BabyCake cupcakes - Thumper's Odyssey (carrot cake w/ cream cheese frosting) and PB&amp;B (peanut butter and banana). Both very tasty - cupcakes are made on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays so keep that in mind if you want the best selection and also the freshest batch. . $45 for two people. . *** Ironically when we wanted the bill he was nowhere to be found.","We got a full pizza from here which was priced at 35 dollars which is something you can expect from a pizza joint on the strip. The pizza was decent at best. It barely had any sauce on it. The best part of the pizza was the crust because it was thin and crispy. I dont think ill visit this place again.","looked for a pizza place near our resort. We ordered online, two 18\" pizza's; stated it would be 15-25 minutes. It took 55 minutes, but the pizza was good. The staff didn't seem to be happy, but oh well, we got our pizza.","Happy Hour from 2-6pm!. Mom and I went on a Monday evening (prior to seeing White Christmas at the Cinemark upstairs. ). We got there around 5:40pm and still had 20 minutes left on the HH menu!  . And what's great is that the HH menu is available in the regular dining area. . SCORE!. So. . . we had $3 Asahi draft beers, veggie pizza (more like a flatbread that was surprisingly good), potstickers, sweet thai chili chicken and a chicken garlic bowl. . Both chicken dishes were great. I was surprised. I figured it was just . . . ya know. . . plain chicken with sauce. . . nope. . . both were juicy and had wonderful flavor. . I think we liked the sweet thai chili chicken the best. It had the whole sweet / hot thing going on. . Service was nice, and the food came out as it was ready. . . not all at once which really worked for us so that we could nibble here and there. . Since it was Monday. . . it wasn't crowded. I bet on the weekends it is tho. . We will be back. . . especially for HH!","Nice little pizza spot in Rock Hill. Since I'm from NY, I am picky about pizza. This wasn't bad though. The slices a little small but tasty. I had the lunch special if two slices and a drink for 5 bucks. They have a lot of other lunch specials that I will be trying out.","This is one of our favorite places on the strip. What a super cool vibe. Steampunk, hip, dark, Edison bulbs, cool bartenders, cool waitress, just a great atmosphere all around. Casual dress. Didn't feel touristy at all -which we love, 'cause we are locals. We didn't do any of the specialty cocktails, because if you are a die hard gin/vodka drinker - the drinks would be considered \"weak\" for you. Bartender steered us clear -which was very cool, cause he knew the drinks would be too - foo foo and \"lite\" and not enough kick for us. So, we stuck with vodka tonics. Good pours. Can't complain. Now, food - pretty dang great. We had appys. Can't remember them totally by name but here we go:  fried green tomatoes (that was a special that night), cured salmon pizza, and quail eggs/bacon on some type of toast. All were delicious. Chef is unbelievable!  Crazy combinations of ingredients that all just work. We live north west LV and if we had a joint up here like this place - that would be our weekly, local joint. Oozes cool. We will be back.","Wow! What a great find. We got the pizza fires/ bacon cheese fries and funnel fries. They were all amazing. I think the funnel fries are a must for anyone. They were melt in your mouth amazing! Great services and such a cute building.","o ya, they do really nice job and the food, ya buddy. Good pizza and service!","Pretty good pizza. . . . better than the usual chain joints like Mamma's, Pizza Pizza. A small cut above Pizza Nova. Kind of like Pizzaiola. . But not good enough to invade your daydreams. . Libretto is much much better.","Let me begin by saying, I loVVVe Grimaldi's . I have gone to every location in Vegas, multiple times. Some more than others. We Always get the same thing. Caesar salad &amp; pepperoni pizza. . not that adventurous but anyone who knows Grimaldi's, knows their menu is not huge. Totally ok as their items are  scrumptious, juicy &amp; the Very \"Best of Lasvegas\". I have been here so many times Ive lost count. . if u want a great pizza in Vegas, find a Grimaldi's. I have 1 issue, which Im hoping will not become a regular one. . I'm also in love with their Caesar salad &amp; their perfectly baked browned croutons! With a small list of ingredients, 1 thing can throw the whole experience off in a salad &amp;. . it finally happened:(. . hoping the chef was just busy that day??? The croutons were pale, uncooked, flavorless &amp; blaaa. . . aa. . aaa. a:(. . normally, they're fantastic! I spoke to the waitress &amp; I could feel the reaction though her face didn't show it. She brought me more. . but to no avail. . the same lame, lifeless, bodi less crouton. . :( U cant have a great Caesar salad without a great crouton. . just my 2cents. . Im hoping it was just busy that day. . tho mid day on a week day. . the menu is small, so I hope I dont lose my loVe for their Caesar salad here. . keep the croutons in the oven longer, Pleeaaassee. \"Its in the details\", noT just the pizza. :) If u r looking for a stellar pizza joint, Grimaldi's is it. .","Never been to Levetto before, but was near Chinatown and go figure. . . we chose to eat Italian food in Chinatown. We ordered the Carbonara pasta and the Pollo Toscano pizza. Both were delicious! . The carbonara was cheesy with lots of bacon! How can you go wrong with bacon? . But the pizza was the star of the meal. This was probably the best pizza we've had. The crust was perfectly crisp on the bottom and pillowy on top. The ingredients were oh so fresh! The tomato sauce was delicious! Chicken was tender and juicy. The cheese and the basil leaf on every slice to top it off were just perfect!. Service was also excellent. We were seated in the back room as the front was full. We thought we'd be neglected back there but as soon as our jug of water was done it was replaced with a new one immediately, without having to ask. How did they know? . Can't wait to try to peiking duck pizza next time.","This place has a lovely room that feels private and cozy. We were sat at a table by a window in front of a closed curtain. No one offered to open it for us. The young lady that sat us was very pleasant and promptly offered us water. It was fairly obvious that the gentleman that served us favored his tables of regulars over new customers. Other tables were visited multiple times before or plates were cleared. Our drinks were never empty but he definitely was short and less than polite and seemed annoyed that we were the \"third table in a row to order pizza\". . Our actual meal,  which took entirely too long to arrive at the table, was subpar and some of the worst pizza I've eaten in my life. I was shocked to see they had an award by the door posted by the door for excellent pizza. Our first course (asparagus fries) was nothing special. Asparagus covered in panko crumbs and deep fried then served with a tzaziki style white dip that was basically sour cream with dill. There was no seasoning or flavor to the appetizer. The pizza took an extraordinary amount of time to arrive at our table. The server came to our table after we'd been waiting for a about 25 min AFTER our appetizers were finished to say that the kitchen cooked the pears wrong so they have to be redone. I work in a restaurant and the friend I was with is a chef, both of us were sorely put off by the server blaming the kitchen. When the pizza finally arrived at our table it was cold (despite being told that it was fresh out of the oven). There was about 2 inches of crust and where there were toppings, they were scarce. The crust wasn't even tasty enough to compensate. It tasted like it was precooked, hard as a rock and about as flavorful as an unsalted soup cracker. . All in all,  we were very disappointed with our meal and definitely will not be returning.","Most bland pizza I have had in a while. Maybe I just picked wrong since there did seem to be quite a selection of pizzas on display. For real, it seems hard to mess up a white pizza, so I went with the Blanco. On second thought, maybe that's the problem. A simple pizza relies on solid ingredients to make it memorable. And this one had about as much love as an awkward first date. I tried to spice it up by adding a ton of chili flakes, but that didn't even resuscitate a flutter of a heart beat to this pale lackluster meal.","We normally visit Pizza Nova or Ginos when the craving for pizza is upon us but we decided to give this place a try. I love to support small local business so I was very excited to try this place. It is a small location in a plaza surrounded by a neighbourhood enclave. Mostly take-out but they do have a few tables to eat in if you'd prefer. Our order consisted of a large pizza and an order of lasagna. Our order was ready fairly quick and we returned home hungrily and ready to dig in: First,  the pizza: We ordered a large meat lovers pizza which consisted of pepperoni, sausage, ground beef and ham. The pizza was cooked well however,  wasn't as flavourful as we hoped. The crust is more of a 'bread\" style crust,  not really crispy as we prefer. Overall,  I would say it wasn't horrible, but nothing to write home about either. Perhaps a step up from a frozen grocery store pizza. On to the lasagna:  In short,  it was horrible. Soggy, gummy noodles, sauce that tasted like a cross between tomato paste and ketchup, rubbery cheese and a burnt bottom. My toddler who lives on pasta of any kind woulden't even eat it after the first bite. Overall this place satisfied my curiosoty however,  we will not be returning. Still on the hunt for a new mom-and-pop pizza shop.","No Frills brand Chicken Nuggets passed off as \"boneless wings\" are you kidding me? The pizza itself was fine but the nuggets and my half full box of wedges made this a terrible experience.","Went here for lunch yesterday to meet a friend that was here from out of town. The pizza was just ok. . . nothing spectacular. However, my son did enjoy the extra layers of pepperoni on his pie. The warm root salad was ok but again nothing spectacular and was fairly small considering the price. I'll stick to our local Pizza hangouts next time around.","For the price (free,  after attending a time share presentation), this was a great buffet and show package. The printed price on the ticket was $16 for dinner and included tax and tip. . The line to redeem the voucher was VERY VERY VERY LONG!  MANY customers were complaining and saying things like,  \"If we were at the Bellagio,  we wouldn't have to wait like this\"; &amp; \"They have only 2 clerks and they look like they are college students\"!  I was worried that I wouldn't have time to eat before the 9:30pm Mystere show,  but the polite, calm young man assured me that the buffet closed at 10pm. . Down the hallway was the \"short\" buffet line. I peeked inside and saw quite a few empty tables. . . okay. . . As soon as I got my table,  I scouted out the food: BBQ station,  Pasta Station,  Baked Potato Station;  Asian Section; Salad Station; Dessert section &amp; a bar!. Due to limited time, I had to skip the pasta and potato. I had a rib. . . it was ok. I had the pepperoni pizza, Unagi &amp; maki sushi - good!  The made to order Cobb Salad was great!  The dessert (creme brulee,  chocolate covered strawberries,  soft coconut macaroons,  &amp; fresh mini donuts) was fantastic! I saw the fryer for the donuts so I knew they'd be yummy! . If I had a bigger tummy and more time, I would get the red velvet cupcakes, the peel &amp; eat shrimp,  the made to order pasta, the won ton soup, pho, fresh fruit and cheese. Guess I will have to return!","Food is super good. Sandwiches and pizza are my favorites. Service is friendly. Couldn't give it a 5 because of spotty wifi and limited parking. There's been times when I've wanted to come and just driven off to another place because of lack of parking. Overall great food and good coffee if you're not a coffee snob!","Ah yes. . . Big Jim's. I have been eating here since the early 80s when my Mom worked there. My first memory of video games comes from Big Jim's. I was sitting on someone's lap playing a table top version of Q-Bert. Those were the days. . This place is just a hole in the wall. But its a great one. No matter what you get off the menu, its tasty. This time, we got the open-faced roast beef sandwich, the open-faced turkey sandwich, a small cheese pizza and a chicken parm sandwich. . The two open-faced sandwiches are awesome. Big piles of meat and gravy on top of hearty chunks of Italian bread and thin-cut homemade fries. The turkey was real sliced turkey from a turkey breast. The roast beef is fresh sliced, too. . The pizza is always good. The really pile on the cheese. Unfortunately today, they piled the sauce on, too. There was literally enough sauce to scoop off the pizza and eat with a fork. Which I did, because their sauce is almost as good as my own. Still though. . . all that sauce is not needed. . The chicken parm was okay. It was a large chicken cutlet but it wasn't very crispy. The bread was good and just like the pizza, the cheese was piled high on this hoagie. . Other than the overly saucy pizza the only real complaint was the waitress wasn't very friendly. This is atypical of the place and this is the first time I can recall having a crabapple for a server here. . I don't like to base my reviews on previous visits, and I won't. But I well touch base on some of the other menu items that are top notch. Their pasta is always good. They really do have a good sauce. I'm not the kind of person who likes ordering pasta in restaurants because its never as good as my own (or my father's). But Big Jim's is the sort of place I can break my rules over. . They have these fried eggplant appetizers. They're awesome. Skip the parmesan version and just get them with marinara on the side. . The salads are always huge. Just make sure you tell them you don't need any french fries on them. . . Big Jim's, just like many other restaurants in this city, likes to muck up a perfectly good salad by dumping fries all over them. They have a homemade Italian dressing that is truly delicious. We've commented time and time again how we wish we could buy it by the bottle and take it home with us. . All the meat on their sandwiches is the real deal. Actual sliced roast beef and turkey. I don't know where they get their cold cuts from, but they're not cheap. . . . they're quite good. The bread's great, as well. Crispy and flaky on the outside, soft and hearty on the inside. . Like I said. . . pretty much everything on the menu is good. We've tried a little bit of everything on the menu and you can't go wrong.","Me and family love this place. Have been coming here for years. The Margarita pizza is amazing. My fav of thier pizza's. The best thing i love ordering and my family are the wings. I always get 1 large of hot and i large 1/2 Honey bbq and the rest hot. The sauce they use for the hot wings is amazing. My favorite spot for wings and Margarita pizza. Going there tonight for some wings.","As we walked into Vapiano, the hostess greeted us by saying we were preparing to dine \"at the Mercedes of cafeterias. \"  Um. . . what? On that note, we were told to seat ourselves, and that's about where the attention and service ended (even though we told the hostess this was our first time). The basic concept is one of cafeteria-type stations: salad, pizza, pasta. Each diner receives a tracking card to swipe at the chosen station once the order has been placed. The menu is fairly large, so it's easy to find something to make everyone happy, but the extras and specialties are a bit hidden. For example, I didn't realize I could add veggies to my marinara &amp; mozzarella pasta until I overheard someone ordering next to me; additionally, only some people at my table were offered complimentary bread when they ordered. Drinks were self-serve from the fountain machine in the back, but we had to ask one of the servers (who were few and far between) for glasses. On the whole, the food was pretty good, but the level of service (or lack thereof) and total concept just didn't do anything for me.","How our pizza came from delivery $22 order to have it delivered looking like it fell on the floor board","This place never fails to entertain me. after a particularly boozy night out with the girls, we went and hit up Awesome kitchen, only to find it packed and full of other drunkards. It was like being at a really crowded frat party except with brighter lights. I saw, within 20 minutes of lining up;  two fights, was grabbed by a stranger,  a lot of shoving, and watching a girl throw up on teh sidewalk, we had our pizza. It was worth it. Oh the best part was when we asked what kind of pizza was being prepared the owner says, 'pepperoni, donair, two fuc**ng veggie . . . and a god*amn hawaiian'. Sigh, this place is the best.","I want this pizza to be better than it is, if they could change a few things it probably would be as good as they claim. . I gave them a fair shake and waited to write this review after ordering from them 4 times. . Thin crust Pizza should be CRISP, mine was a soggy undercooked mess drowning in sauce, and skimping on toppings. . Original crust Pizza was also undercooked and drowning in sauce with a lack of toppings, some of which they even forgot. . -PLEASE use a light hand when saucing the pizzas and don't just squirt a pile of BBQ sauce on from the bottle, it should be evenly applied with a ladle and a swirl too. . . How does the pizza have time to cook when it arrives literally 15 minutes after I hang up the phone? . I'm more concerned about quality than I am about your speedy delivery. . -PLEASE take the time to thoroughly cook those pizzas! . It seems when I order a pizza with meat for my man it's loaded with meat but when I order a veggie one for myself they tend to be stingy, especially with mushrooms for some reason. . -PLEASE be generous with the veggies if I order a pizza with no cheese or meat! . Fresh Herbs mean just that, FRESH, but when they are put on the pizza before baking they shrivel up and dry out and lose all flavor. . -PLEASE Put Herbs on the Pizza once it has come out of the oven!! . . One more thing, PLEASE have your phone staff go through some more training. . I'm not giving up on you NAKED, but next time I order it will have to be in person so things are done right. . Let's get those stars up!","One of the best pizza restaurants out there. Super fast delivery, amazing food, and great prices. Highly recommend this place!","If I could give it negative stars, I would. The absolute worst service of all time. I can't speak to the pizza because, after waiting 45+ minutes for our pizza, the waitress asked us if we had ordered a pizza. I told her yes. She came back and asked what we ordered. There were only two other tables seated in the entire place, both of which had been served their food already! And she wrote down our order! I WATCHED HER! She came back again and just muttered something about not knowing what happened but they didn't make our pizza. I asked for the bill for our drinks and salad and said F the pizza. . One star for the stellar, giant bowl of iceberg lettuce garnished with two slices of cucumber and a couple grape tomatoes. They call this exotic dish \"salad. \". I've never left a restaurant more hungry than when I arrived before now. Maybe the proprietors should screen potential service employees by asking if they've ever set foot in a restaurant. This young lady clearly hadn't. (I've spared some of the annoying details, trust and believe this \"server\" was the portrait of incompetence. )","After a long day of hiking in red rock canyon I found this little gem of a place on yelp. We ordered a large pizza and antipasti salad, food came out quick and was delicious. Guys behind the counter were very attentive, checked on us multiple times to make sure we had everything we needed","Excellent friday dinner . relaxing atmosphere - pizza was steaming hot &amp; tasted great!!  The manager Laura rocks","Stopped in to grab food before I went to my hotel room and had a great time waiting for my food. The one staff that helped me made my morning with his retorts to my \"jokes. \" I ordered a cheese pizza and steak nachos, which was pretty good (considering it beats the microwaveable pizzas I get from the grocery store. . . and the nachos were larger portions compared to the nachos I get from Taco Bell). . Cons: Price is as expected in Vegas, I suppose. . TLDR: If you're hungry, this place hits the spot if you're staying at the Nugget.","Our new favorite pizza spot! Affordable and the delivery was pretty quick. They also followed our specifications when we ordered and made sure everything was cooked well-done, just the way we like it!","The service was great!  Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The patio was delightful!  My husband and I enjoyed a bottle of Argentina wine that was good. The bruschetta was just ok; we tried 4 different varieties and not one of them really stood out as fantastic. My parents shared a pizza that they said was delicious. I had 2 cups of soup. . . pasta e fagioli and cheddar broccoli. I could definitely make better at home. My husband had chicken parm; he said it was meh!  Surely wouldn't be my first choice to go back to for the food; it was pretty standard run-of-the-mill restaurant food.","Tried a \"Damn Good\" pizza at Sophie's based on a local recommendation. It was the worst pizza we've ever had. Hardly any toppings - we counted 12 olive slices on an XL pizza and there was very little meat and cheese. It was mostly crust and sauce, both of which were horrible, we were scraping the toppings off the crust rather than eating it, the box would probably have had more flavor. The sauce was very spicy and not in a good way, even the 12 year-old in our group had heartburn into the next day, as we all did. Horrible pizza.","Went here tonight cause we had a Groupon and that was one of the worst Gorupon we have ever had. . First: The waitress Kelly had zero personality, I ordered a Summer's Shandy and she brings me a Miler Light. . Second: The appetizer was a frozen bagged Arrincini, it was mush in the middle and not even good. . Third: Kelly brings over the pizza and small saucers, never have I ever see this. She off no cheese, red pepper nothing. She does not even bring a pizza cutter for us, so we used the butter night. . I dont think we will ever go back, from the moment we sat down to the to the time Kelly left for the day, Gerta took over out table and it was much better to see a smile on a servers face. It was a horrible experience. Very poor service (Kelly) and food. Was hoping it would better.","I went here for after dinner drinks with one of my girl friends the other night. It is located the trendy Lakewood area with plenty of street parking. The immediate ambiance is intimate with dim lighting, strings of lights, high top tables and the bar that runs along the back wall. Very cozy and cute. They have a small patio area too, we originally began at a high top but moved to one of the three community tables on the patio. Since it is smaller it may be too crowded for my preference on weekends so a week day night was perfect. . Onto the wine! They offer an extensive lists of bottles and also wines by the glass. We ordered a bottle of a sparkling rose, Albrecht Cremant as well as the white wine cheese tray. The wine was excellent, perfect to enjoy on a warm night on their patio. The cheese tray was good too, however, it seemed like only two servers were there so we ended up drinking an entire glass of wine before the tray got to the table, maybe 25 minutes. When it arrived though it was well worth the wait! The Brie, cheddar and Grayson were my favorites. Wonderfully complimented the wine. The pizzas that tables around us were ordering looked delicious too! . I can't wait to come back regularly during the summer! Overall this place is great for a casual wine night. I would highly recommend it.","Updating my review because the quality has really declined over the last year. Service is frequently inattentive, they forget your drink order, leave you waiting so long it's awkward, etc. Quality of the food varies too. We recently got a salad that was mostly arugula stems with a pizza where they forgot the sauce and then added blobs of it after the pizza was cooked. The fact that anyone allowed that food to leave the kitchen is sad. We've been coming here for years and we're unlikely to return again.","Ordered from there out of the blue finding them here on Yelp. I got a custom stuffed pizza and I couldn't be happier. Not only was the pizza a great value overall, but it was also really really good!. Btw, I'm from the Chicago area, so I've had a lot of great deep dish and stuffed pizza. This ranks up there with the best of them!","I've  been going to the LA Fitness on University and Stapely for about 16 months now, after moving to Phoenix from Tucson. I've been to a few other LA Fits near me, as well as some of the former 24hr Fitness locations. But this is by far my favorite location! It is generally clean and well kept. It is VERY spacious!  At some of the other gyms I feel like when I'm squatting I'm going to wind up sitting in someone's lap. There's plenty of equipment and even during busy hours it never feels claustrophobic. The staff there is fabulous. John, the GM greets me by name when ever he sees me and he always is professional and pleasant with members. Nicole, the Operations Manager, is really the unsung hero of the gym. She puts up with a lot and yet always has a professional, courteous and warm demeanor. She goes out of her way to help people. Granted, as a former personal trainer, I have a different perspective because I understand how corporate gyms are run. The people who complain and criticize the staff have a limited view of what really goes on; and as someone who deals with the public and in customer service I can appreciate what the staff is faced with and how sometimes they are restricted by corporate policy. My background, though, helps me see how valuable these employees really are!  The other thing I love about this gym are the members. Of course, there are your typical meathead types. But mostly, everyone here is really nice, respectful, and knows gym etiquette. As a women, I have NEVER felt uncomfortable, disrespected, or intimidated. In fact, I've made many of my friends here!  This gym and these people made my transition to Phoenix SO much easier!!!  This gym is my home away from home and I would recommend it to anyone, especially women who might be a little \"gym shy. \"  You won't be intimidated here. You won't be judged. You also won't get pizza. . . But you will get encouragement and see better results because of it. And isn't that what's important?","I contest the Harmony's placement in the dive bar category. This one of the best of Wisconsin's old style taverns still operating, essentially a bar meant for the whole family. I've seen plenty of people bring their kids in for some pizza around dinner (pretty good too), they clear out as the band sets up to entertain the adults for the evening. It's nice that the band area is separate from the bar, making it easier to order and converse if you don't care for the music. They have a great bar with a good tap selection, and the whole place has enough space that I've never felt packed in even on busy Friday nights.","90 seconds to delicious!. I love that I can eat this pizza without needing tons of napkins and feeling the constant need to wipe grease from my mouth! The wood fire crust is a delight. . Great place to go when you're in a hurry. If you call ahead the quoted time might be like mine tonight, a quick 5 minutes!. I have deducted a star because the toppings can be scarce. I'm not looking for loaded but I'm looking for a taste of each ingredient in each bite.","I was here recently and I am changing my review. . Only good thing about our lunch was the weather on the patio. . The patio was busy, not surprising for a nice day. It took over 40 minutes before we had our orders. One special and a pizza. Other tables had been seated, served, ate and left in that amount of time. . The food was lacking in flavour. The tomato sauce looked homemade but tasted straight out of the can. At least they didn't over cook the noodles.","An old staple of my old stomping grounds. The white cheese pizza here is the most popular among my friends. This place has just been here so long that I dont think that even if they served awful pizza to you, it wouldnt make a difference. I am not saying they ever have but this place. . . like I said is a staple. The crust is burned most of the time so it is crunchy and the actual pie isnt that thick so if thats your bag, this place will be good for you. Honestly though, you have to try the white cheese pizza. . .","We ordered the 24 wings (8 honey bbq, 8 lemon pepper, &amp; 8 hot). It is nice that they can split up the wings that way and everyone get their own flavors. I loved my lemon pepper wings. YUM!  I ordered and shared a flatbread pizza:  Garlic parm chicken. Right on!!!  . The served was ok. We had to ask for refills.","So I came here with a friend to watch Game 4 of the NBA finals. . We arrived right around the start of the game and there were still a lot of seating available. It's a fairly new establishment so maybe not many people know about it yet? People did slowly come in to occupy tables but it never really got that full. . The server we had, whom I will not name because I don't know if this review will help or hurt him, was friendly and sociable. My friend had ordered a serving of honey garlic chicken wings. We didn't find out until later on while just looking at the daily deals that there was a deal on wings on Wednesdays. She brought it up with the server and asked if the deal applied and he to think about what day it actually was before saying yes, and he would go make sure the wings were discounted to the deal price which was $7. 99. People make mistakes and I, for one, am prone to losing track of days as well so I don't hold anything against him for that. But so that he doesn't screw up in the future or lose money for the business, he should probably be more on top of that. Otherwise, he was doing everything else right. Was pleasant, came by to refill our drinks often and made sure we were okay. Did a good job building rapport too, using basketball (of course) to create some common ground. . Anyways onto the food. . Like I mentioned above, my friend ordered a serving of wings while i ordered the pizza pocket burger thing lol. I don't remember what it's actually called but I will attach a picture to this review. Honey garlic wings were what you'd expect. I'd usually never order them myself because I find it a boring flavour. But if you like honey garlic, I'm almost certain you'd like them here. The burger pizza pocket thing was pretty good. I certainly like the concept. I ordered mine with a side of fries and i regret not getting a salad. Or at least get a side with vegetables and not potatoes because with all the meat and everything, it's a pretty heavy entree. I'm not sure if I'm a slow eater or not, but the cheese did not stay hot and melted for long enough. Maybe serving the meal and a heated plate would help with that because it would definitely help with making the second half of the pizza pocket more enjoyable. Since it's cut in half, while you're eating the first half, the second half is left open and cools down pretty quick. . Anyway, I had a much better experience at this Boston Pizza than at the Warden and Steeles location. They did try to reach out to me to talk about my bad experience but when i replied to them asking how i could assist them they stopped responding. lol. Anyways, this is a pretty new Boston Pizza and there is still lots of room for improvement, but If they keep it up, i think that can be very successful.","People here are rude and pizza sucks don't go. They don't care about customers. Vistancia better without them.","I really love the concept of this restaurant. It was the first time I had been, and it's a little intimidating at first because you don't quite know where to start. But the staff is great and walks you through each step of the way. It's very similar to a chipotle for pizza. You choose your toppings or you can choose one of their specialty pizzas and they also have salad and bruschetta and dessert. They have beer and wine as well. And the quality of the pizza was good they took it while you wait it doesn't take very long and there are lots of different combinations I got a goat cheese and prosciutto pizza very tasty.","I used to work around the area and would stop by Micheal`s at least 3-4 times a day after work before catching the Viva home. This place is awesome, me and my coworkers also walk here for lunch as they have a nice hot foods, and salad section. . So, to the hot foods and ready to eat section. you can get a pretty decent coffee and pastry in the morning, and its pretty decent coffee.  for lunch, they have a paninni and pizza section, there`s usually 2 hot soups with bread, and there`s a different types of prepared food and i love their lasagna. They always package up day old foods so you can get a pretty good deal on that. They also have a sushi section, which goes on sale at the end of the day, so you can get a good deal there. there`s an option for brown rice too for those even more health conscious. . I love their pastry section, decently priced tartes and these like, 20 cent cream cheese filled pastries, what a deal! Great breads, great prepared sauces, i especially loved their bolongaise sauce.  . Cheeses and Meats - i went thru a phase when i loved smelly cheeses and they had a great variety for me, like specialty cheeses and meats you wouldnt find at your normal grocery store, like roquefort blue cheese.  . meat section - is pretty good, thing i love about this place is how fresh it is. . seafood selection - its good quality, but not the biggest, its pretty small actually. . produce - is fresh and everything is so neatly presently. I had been grocery shopping in asian markets, and i love asian markets, but, sometimes, the flies just really get in the way of food selection.  there are no flies in michaelangelos.  it seems like every fruit and produce was hand selected.  . in the summer, they set out a bbq for the lunchtime crowd, its awesome.  like for 7-8 dollars, you can get a drink, chips, burger, corn, it was the best. . . im very sad i dont work next to it anymore :(","This is my favorite restaurant!  Recommendations on dining would be the surf &amp; turf (the shrimp is amazing and they should really think about making it a full meal) or any type of steak!  The bread sticks are absolutely the best I've ever had! . My one and only complaint would be the one time my husband picked up pizza for carry out - they were slightly rude to him while he waited. The pizza a pretty good deal considering the quality.","We started with the meatballs and then we had a Napoli Centrale calzone (huge-amazing!) and a special pizza with ragout sauce, sausage and smoked provolone. . . out of this world. . Service was prompt and friendly. Great for a date, for families or simply with friends. I m looking forward to my next pizza. P. S. Spicy sauce to die for.","This pizza hut is HORRIBLE next to my house. I order 16 peice bone out half garlic half medium. .  they bring me 24 wings saying \"hey we messed up and dressed all the wings with gp here 24 wings with an 8 peice of medium\" the 8 peice is flavored with mild sauce not medium. Get the fuck outta here. Ex employee who hates bad service.","Terrible. I get the pizza is not expensive but it can at least be fresh cheese not room temperature, crusty hard cheese that when you take one bite all falls off the pizza in one sheet. Disgusting. And this wasn't just once, happened about 3 or 4 times but never complained since it's so cheap but this last time was enough and I took the pizza back and will never be going here again. Don't be cheap and just spend more money on Barros or Pizza Hut across the street.","Wow! RCP is a weekly run for myself and my brothers family(two small children includes!). And for 6 weeks in a row it has been perfect. Havent seen any of the issues other people seen to find! Thick or under cooked crust??? Nope perfectly crispy outside and cooked inside!!! As far as it being thick, the crust is thinner than any pan pizza you get from the other delivery places. Sauce is great perfectly cheesed each time!! The antipasto plate is HUGE and a great price!!! And  really. 50$ PBR!!!! yeah ding ding ding winner. As for the service. . . . 100% amazing!!! Drinks are never empty, food comes out fast and hot and all of the servers have been nothing but attentive! Even when the place is 100% full!!(which yes is easy  its pretty small inside and a few out door tables)  Now for the atmosphere. . . . its a New York joint!!! Unless you thought it was a different Radio City????? New York sports on the tube. . . lots of NY love. . . and being a New Yorker this is HEAVEN! I dont really write reviews. . . nor frequent places that dont rock. . . . this place is amazing!!  See ya next week!!!","+ They deliver . - With no great sense of urgency . Tomaydo Tomahhdo is your general one-stop-shop for office lunches. They do soups, salads, sandwiches (bistro and grilled), and flatbread pizzas, so everyone is bound to find something they like. . Everything I've had has been perfectly adequate. My most-recent salad was a little heavy on the chopped iceberg (arguably the cheapest ingredient known to man), but I did appreciate the variety of salad dressings offered (I had Honey Cilantro Lime). . Overall, a safe, standard bet, but nothing to rave about. . On a side note, I'm impressed I made it through this review without referencing \"potayto, potahhto\" or \"let's call the whole thing off!\" in a sing-song voice. . Whoops.","This is the place to be on a Friday or Saturday night. It is open late! The beer selection is fantastic and they have ok food, they are known for there pizza which is good. I gave two stars because the service sucks. You could sit at the bar for 10 min and have the servers all walk past you and not get your order, and then ask or talk to someone else right next to you. This has happened to me the last two times and it's not good service, am I invisible? I go when everywhere else is closed not because I want too.","Loved this place! It has everything you need to have a good time. Great beers on tap, fantastic pizza and an amazing atmosphere. The old house feels warm and welcoming from the second you step inside. It felt like I was at a good friend's house party in college but with good beer. The staff was super friendly from the bartenders to the guy slanging the pizzas. It reminded me of some of my favorite places in Austin, TX but minus the hipster crap that normally comes with Austin. If/when I'm in Calgary again I will be stopping by and you should do the same. Thanks for a great night!","I've been a fan of Oregano's since their original location in Old Town Scottsdale. They have done a great job adding locations. I've been to restaurants that struggle to duplicate the success. No so, the managers at Oregano's have their act together, including a full practice night of orders, acting customers, and creating great food before they open to the public. . Long live Oreganos. The thin crust Lawrence pizza is great, add sausage is you want some meat. The spinach broccoli pan pizza is amazing. The Pablo Picasso salad is a wonderful blend of a little spicy salsa and thin tortilla chips with chicken. You must try this salad. The place is good for kids, family, a night out, or the out of towners that come in. It's a must visit in Arizona. I've been lucky with the wait on Germann. If you go at a 7, prepare for a long wait and have a cocktail.","Since they've opened their door almost a year ago I've frequented this joint once a month or so. I always sit at the bar, which is fan-cooled during the summer months and heated during these chilly wintery nights.  . Their pies are consistently delicious, especially the Shreiner's sausage with fennel. Their sides are ok, not bad, not amazing, but are ok. I've recently fallen in love with their calamari appetizer. Perhaps it's just the combination of breading + deep-fried that pushes all the right buttons for me, but whatever it is, it's delicious whether served with the basil chili sauce, a garlic aioli or the marinara.  . The only pizza I haven't been a huge fan of is their potato and gorgonzola. However, this was more of a mistake on my part; I dislike gorgonzola intensely, and for some reason still thought it might be a good idea to order that pie, hoping that the gorgonzola would be minimal. . . it wasn't. My bad :P. . But in addition to their delicious pizza is a fairly comprehensive wine and beer collection. If you want to experience a zillion beers, this is not the place, but they do have something on tap for every palate, from hefeweizen to a nice IPA.","Fiercely feeling the pizza cravings laying on my couch one night, I decided to browse SkipTheDishes in search of a good classic pizza pie. I wasn't looking for thin-crust or Neapolitan style - those are always best eaten right out of that scorching oven they're made in - and I'm not much of a deep dish guy, so I just wanted a few slices of classic 'za while I glare at the tube. . Before I knew it, my driver had arrived and brought with him a gift from Bow Tie - a beautiful and massive 14\" meat pizza, half of which I later freezer bagged for the following week. The Meat Lovers came stacked with pepperoni, salami, ham and bacon, all on a thin layer of tomato sauce, and topped with a generous serving of melted mozzarella. To round out the deli meats, I added a few extra toppings - onions, mushrooms and green peppers; some of my favourites. The meats all tasted fresh as can be and it was evident that the veggies weren't soggy and old, but freshly cut, perhaps only hours before. As someone who doesn't enjoy eating plain crust, I made a mental note that the outsides of this pie were just as tasty as the insides. The crust had a softer crunch, something that only a quality dough will offer. The word \"stacked\" I mentioned earlier was no exaggeration - this pizza was massive and could have been mistaken for a deep dish at first glance. . If you want real-deal - Seniore's and Vern's are the only joints in town that I believe have this place beat - do yourself a solid and get some delivery from Bow Tie Pizza. Just thinking about biting into one of those flavourful, meaty, warm slices of goodness is making me salivate all over again. It can be next to impossible fighting pizza cravings, amirite?","I came here with my parents for dinner. We REALLY liked the complimentary bread they started us off with. It was garlicky and slightly cheesy, rather buttery - absolutely delicious. I wish I spent more time on the bread as that was my favourite thing during dinner. We ordered 3 dishes to share: carbonara, chicken marsala, and the Arugula &amp; Gorgonzola pizza. Everything was pretty good, but it kind of paled in comparison to the bread.","This pizza is hard to beat!  I've been going here for years and am always satisfied with the quality of the pizza and the service.","After a long first day in Vegas (early flight and 3 hour time change the primary culprits) we were ready for dinner. Flour and barley had shown up on a twenty five best beer spots in Vegas so I was happy to try it. . They had some good beers on the draft list. Unfortunately a local brewer was doing a \"tap takeover\" and I didn't love their choices. Went with a pizza port swami in a can and it was decent. Wife enjoyed the drink of the day. . Once again we struck checkin offer gold as the app we wanted was the free offer. Ordered that and our usual pizza -- pepperoni and kalamata olive. No complaints -- perfect size, good crust, and the roni was very good. . Server was friendly but cost them a sale. If she'd been around more often I definitely would have done a second beer. Outside seating was nice except for the time where a typically selfish or oblivious smoker stood just outside the fence with his foul habit drifting our way. Enjoyed paying as well as the prices were very reasonable. Good experience overall.","Great interior design, decent service but not amazing. Staff floated around making marks on iPads without interacting with customers - struck me as a bit odd. My 2-star review is due to their wheat-contaminated gluten-free pizza crust. Granted, everyone makes mistakes, but when I let the front-desk staff know that I suffered all weekend because of wheat contamination from their pizza, they shrugged and said 'ok. ' and looked away. No 'oh, thanks for letting us know, we'll work on that. ' or 'sorry. '  Just nothing. Can't recommend, as a result.","So fresh. So tasty. So interesting. So healthy. I enjoyed the chicken pita pizza and they had wonderful Greek salads. My husband had chicken ka-bobs and loved them. Can't wait to go again. My mom bought a jar of their salad dressing for $4 because it was so good. The dressing also makes a great marinade.","I'm impressed with this place. It's a chain (there's one in Square One) and it's in the new Aura building complex, so I wasn't sure what to expect. . . Honestly, a restaurant could be pretty mediocre and still survive here because of proximity to so many condos and hotels. But I came to try this place for dinner tonight, and even though they've only been open just over a week, they have their act pretty together. . The staff are great and there are a lot of them. It was a busy night, but everything was prompt. I was immediately greeted and welcomed upon walking in, taken to my table by a different person, and right away someone else came by with water. My main server was knowledgeable about the menu, offering lots of helpful suggestions. The 2 specialties here are the in-house made fresh mozzarella and the homemade meatballs, so I had to get those. Everyday they list the person who is making the mozzarella and the pasta. . My DC and I had:. - Basil and honey spritz - a nice, fresh, gin-based cocktail. I loved the strong basil flavour. . - Negroni - pretty classic, well done. - Burrata - a great sharing item, it comes with ample crostini and is drizzled in honey. - Classic Spaghetti and Meatball - one big meatball on top of nice al dente pasta in a flavourful tomato sauce with lots of fresh basil and fried garlic (there is also a \"stuffed\" meatball option, with pepperoni and mozzarella). The meatball was really juicy and tender, maybe a bit too soft for some, but I liked it. . - Atomica Pizza (spicy sopressata salami, sweet peppers, red onions, pepperoncini, fresh mozzarella, San Marzano tomato sauce) - it was actually quite spicy and there were tons of toppings, with a nice crunchy texture. The pizza is thin crust and not too greasy. It was huge, so expect to have leftovers. . - We didn't have room for dessert, but they have some yummy sounding options - mostly classic Italian desserts (panna cotta, tiramisu, tartufo). . The space itself is a bit loud, but not so much that you can't have a conversation. The atmosphere is casual and lively with a mix of top 40/motown music and TV screens over the bar playing sports. There is an upstairs area and a lot of long tables that could accommodate large groups. It's convenient to where I live and work, so I could definitely see myself coming back to try other items on the menu. Prices are reasonable and the quality of the ingredients is quite good. . NB: sign up for their newsletter and get $10 off when you spend $30 or more!","Fine place to eat when visiting the Strip. It's not fancy so if that's what you want, this is not for you. Decor is old fashioned but the place seems clean. Service was friendly and we got out pizzas very fast. . I thought the white pizza was good but kind of bland. My husband likes the Greek pizza better. Prices reasonable. Large portions. . I would come back if craving Italian when I'm at the strip, but would be interested on trying something other than pizza.","I was excited by the rave reviews of this pizza joint, but somewhat disappointed. What's the deal with Pittsburgh pizza restaurants and canned toppings? If I order mushrooms, I want them to be fresh!. To be fair, the crust and sauce were fine, and I think the meat pizzas are probably ok. If I went back, I would probably stick with cheese pizza.","They ALWAYS bring the perfect product, at the perfect temperature and the best flavorful pizzas we have ever had. ALWAYS on time!!!    ENJOY","Yaay!! 4 stars says it, yo. Though I don't get where people are finding the $$ pricing, this place is SO affordable. I had chicken and waffles ($10, whaaat!!), reisling (solid), and a friggin ridiculous blueberry crepe and some zesty coffee. My dad loved his rueben and pale ale. What I am even more excited about is coming back for the brunch and the supposedly New York Style pizza. Another hidden gem. . Also, we tried sitting outside and the wind blew our water all over the table and the menus were flying all over the place. The staff was SO nice and apologetic, even though it wasn't their fault. Needless to say we sat inside after that, but for a \"tavern, \" it's a pretty cute atmosphere.","I work in the area and have ordered lunch from Toscana twice and have been disappointed both times. If you plan on ordering salad for lunch, don't expect it to be filling. The ingredients mostly consist of just lettuce. Very little of anything else advertised goes into the salad. Had the Margarita pizza once and it lacked flavor. For the money they charge for lunch, I would expect the salads to be more filling. I won't be buying lunch from them anymore. You get more for your money at Zoup.","a must have for the pizza lover, the fact that next door is another one of the greatest pizza shops in the city is a testament to how good this pizza really is .","Great pizza, great patio! I went on a busy summer night but the only wait was for the patio. It was worth the wait. . . service was attentive and friendly, the pizza tasted great and the atmosphere was perfect!","Absolutely my favorite tried it for the first time in an office meeting nobody had ever had it and we will be having their pizza from now on 25 employees and we all loved it","Kings Fish House is a wonderful change of pace from all the buger, pizza and steak houses. First, let me say, I always sit on the casual side, same restaurant, two doors, one casual, one more of a formal ambience. I have been going to Kings since they've opened, and I can say their policy of \" If you don't like it, we will happily replace it\" is tested, tried and true. Their fish is always fresh, a wide variety offered daily, they print new menus for each and everyday. They offer a wide variety of cooking options for each fresh fish. The fresh oysters on the half shell also change daily, I have never been disappointed with the recommendation of the always friendly, polite, cheerful service staff. I think I have had just about everything on the menu, there is something for everyone on the menu, they offer a land lovers section. . I have never been disappointed, treated badly or had anything even remotely close to a bad experience. I do suggest you try, not far from the strip, about 15 minutes, wonderful surroundings and a nice place to unwind! Some may think they are pricey, but for the quality of the fish, and all food really I believe it is priced quite right.","Great selections of pizza and a great salad. We had the Gotham pizza and a chopped salad. Pizza has three meats and thin crust really good. Salad has a very tangy dressing good quality. Not cheap but in our hotel.","Tasty but inconsistent Pizza Hut location. Every time, the food has been delivered very fresh and service friendly. The problem is that our order almost always has something incorrect. Tonight, for example, we were missing balsamic drizzle, dressing for the wings and spicy pepper crust seasoning on the other pizza. . Here, the hand tossed and stuffed crust pizzas are the best. Pan pizza is not truly a pan(thick, raised edge). Don't bother with pretzel crust(they just sprinkle a ton of salt on regular crust). The cheddar, hut and asiago crusts are awesome. The new red  cherry peppers are awesome! Slightly spicy and sweet and we pair those with spinach. Ask for spinach under cheese or they plop it raw on top. The breaded, bone in or the bone out wings are great with either honey BBQ or garlic parm sauces. Just make sure they give you ranch or blue cheese. Everything is better with ranch. :-)","Saw bad reviews but tried anyway. I would never give bad review for new place working out their bugs. Been there twice now - have had good service both times. I had Pig Pizza (awesome), white pizza and burger (also good). Worth trying!","This place has great food. The pizza is very good, and the fried mushrooms are the best I've had so far. It's a bar that has live music, pool tables, and really good pizza. The place is kind of a dump. The bathrooms are disgusting. They should expand their beer menu. It's more of a bar than a family restaurant but if you get here before 8, it's fine for dinner or lunch. The service is good. The staff is very friendly.","Consistently good pub food at pts . . . BBQ chicken pizza, 2 beers, carrots and celery. Love it. Wait staff her was quick and friendly . Plenty of TV s on baseball on a MNF night. Will be back","Had a super weird experience at Lucille tonight. My brother and his wife (both not vegan) wanted to check it out. There wasn't much info from the Madison Vegan group on the place, but I checked the menu and it seemed as though we might be able to stumble our way through and work something vegan out. . Arrived at 7, was told it would be an hour and a half wait (on a Sunday night?!), which was crazy because all the tables on the first floor were empty. Decided to wait it out anyway, so we went down to The Rigby for drinks (THE BEERS WERE BUY ONE GET ONE FREE - WHAT?!). After an hour at The Rigby (great service there btw), we checked in at Lucille and were told they were just cleaning off our table and it would be 10-15 minutes. Cool, I don't think it takes 10-15 minutes to clear off a table, but I'll continue waiting. 15 minutes later, I check in again to be told by a different person it would be another 10-15 minutes because she was \"letting the servers catch up. \" Huh?! True to their word, 15 minutes later, we were seated. . The bottom of the menu has designations for (V)=vegetarian, (VG)=vegan, (P) =pescatarian, (GF)=gluten free. Nothing on the menu was marked VG. My brother asked our server for help with the vegan options, and he pointed out a few on the menu - some marked simply vegetarian were actually vegan, like the black bean and plantain empanadas. My brother asked if some pizzas could be considered vegan if made without cheese - for instance, the Mediterranean pizza (basil and arugula pistou, feta, artichoke hearts, cherry tomato, kalamata olives, spinach, and red onion), and the server said yes, but he felt without the feta, the pizza would have \"no base. \" I've eaten plenty of delicious, veggie-rific cheese-free pizzas, son. That's actually what we ended up ordering in addition to the black bean and plantain empanadas. . The empanadas were delicious, but they were served with an unidentifiable watery white sauce on the side. All I tasted was cilantro; my brother (a chef) said it tasted like creme fraiche. I flagged down someone working at the restaurant (we hadn't seen the server in awhile) who said that it was a \"mayo substance\" and that I should ask our waiter. When he finally showed up again to deliver our pizzas (the empanadas were gone by then), my brother asked what the empanada sauce was. The server said it was salsa verde but he wasn't sure what it was made from and couldn't tell me if there was any dairy in it. . I'm going to stop here for a sidebar. I don't eat animals because I choose not to, but I know there are people out there who have life-threatening food allergies, and I completely understand why they are terrified to eat out at restaurants. I was told by one person that this watery white sauce was a \"mayo-substance\" (nothing in it tasted like Mayo nor was it thick like Mayo) and the second person (the server!) told me he didn't know but he thought it was salsa verde (which is green, tomatillo-based, and doesn't have mayo in it). I feel you, people with food allergies. I get why you're terrified. I'm terrified too. . The sad part about all this is, my pizza was AMAZING. It looked so beautiful and inviting, the crust was perfect, and the veggies on it divine. We ate the whole thing with none left over for lunch tomorrow. The artichoke and kalamata were salty and scrumptious - feta as a base?! Feta would have been overkill. My brother and sister-in-law were pleased with their pizza too, but the hassle we went through to get food tonight means we won't be giving Lucille a second chance. Vegans, you probably shouldn't either. Heck, even non-vegans should steer clear til they get their shit together service-wise. . Sal's forever!","We have been driving by this place for years and never ventured in. We finally did and oh my - fantastico! Had the homemade lasagna and eggplant parmesan, side of meatballs. Wood-fired pizza oven - as good or better with lower prices than our other favorite place nearby in Scottsdale. Our server Dana was awesome even thought she forgot our water - it was very busy so forgivable since she comped the second glass of wine for wife. The owner heard it was our first visit and came over to introduce herself - very charming woman. While this is a further drive than our neighborhood place in Scottsdale, it is worth the drive as we will be retuning often. We can always UBER so we can order more wine!","I always enjoy Beach Pizza. The crust is good and the sauce is tangy. I like that I am able to buy pizza by the slice at a reasonable price.","I can only vouch for the Pizza Depot in the Springdale neighborhood of Brampton. . I gave it a 2/5 stars for the absolute lack of customer service. Calling the number on their sign will put you through to the phone / desk near the ovens and back door of the actual pizza joint. No call center here. And I don't mind, except that the people who answer the phone are extremely rude. They speak in harsh tones as if you are interupting them. They give one word responses when inquiring on specials. If you call them, brace yourself, and prepare to be yelled at or even hung up on. (yes both have happened to me on different occasions). . The pizza: Really good crust. The pepperoni gets nice and crisp on the outer edges. And they dint skimp on the cheese. And if you like extra spice, they will add green chili, garlic, and ginger at no charge. Just ask for it to be spicy. I find it very overwhelming, so I go for mild or none at all. . Other: The wedges are baked, as are the wings and samosas. This is a plus for some, but a negative for me. I'd look elsewhere for my wing fix, as they are pretty generic. Good selection of sauces. . Overall: The pizza is good, but the generic wings and terrible customer service keeps me going to other nearby esablishments.","Just polished off an Enzo Pizza and felt compelled to Yelp. My search for good delivery pizza in Toronto has finally ended,  and Enzo is the king by a wide margin. (Sorry, North of Brooklyn. ) It also has a legitimate argument to being some of the best pizza,  period, in the city. . Hard to define the style -- to me, a cross between Neapolitan and Roman -- but everything is nearly perfectly executed: Tangy sauce; slightly sweet, just - chewy - enough dough; and the right amount of real fior di latte cheese and high quality toppings. (Finally, some fresh hot peppers which are actually hot!). Oh yeah, the service is also super friendly (both the man who took my order and the delivery guy) and the pizza arrived in 30 minutes flat. . Can't ask for anything else. . . other than some more Enzo pizza in the near future.","Is there anything better than eating outdoors on a nice sunny day with temps in the low 80's on green grass among plenty of citrus trees and evergreens  in Phoenix Arizona?? Well this is the setting everyday throughout the fall and spring at Joe's Farm Grill!!. I can't believe I haven't written a review on Joe's Farm Grill already. It's an awesome place to take the family and friends for breakfast or lunch. Their menu is built around things people love to eat now a days and it starts in their garden rather than in their restaurant. They actually grow most of not all of the produce they use in their dishes on site. They will offer some seasonal sides, dishes and deserts based on the seasonality of their fruits and veggies.  . There are loads of reviews already written about specific dishes that are favorites at Joe's Farm Grill, so I wont go into a lot of details concerning their menu. Some of my favorites at Joe's Farm Grill ~ BBQ smoked chicken pizza which is grilled with some char, topped with plenty of blue cheese, some veggies and BBQ sauce. It is DELISH and the perfect app to share with friends. . Some of my fav's: . ~Fontina Burger, Chicken Pesto sandwich, . ~Sonoran Dogs ~ get the X2 for $9. 99 with either their tasty onion rings or sweet potato fries with their Pineapple-serrano dipping sauce, . ~Ahi Tuna and the grilled peanut butter and banana sandwiches. ~Thai Ahi Salad and Chicken Caesar Salad . All of these are a flavor-fest your mouth and tummy will thank you for later :^) . Don't forget to leave room for desert at \"The Coffee Shop\" or a tasty shank/malt!  Everything at Joe's Farm Grill is is well prepared and they are consistent in delivering quality, fresh tasting food.  . This place can get insanely busy on the weekends especially when the weather is nice. You may want to plan your visit to Joe's either early lunch or late breakfast during the week. Bring your dog and kiddos so they can play on the green grass and enjoy a meal outside. I hope to see you at Joe's soon!","We love Giordano's pizza!  However we've gone 0-2 the last couple times being here. We were sat and told 35 mns on the pizza, it's been and hour and a half and we had to ask what's the status? We had a hockey game to make it to and we're now going to miss the first period waiting for a pizza. Someone needs to get this one at the same level as the ones in Chicago!","Ordered my pizza over the phone said 15 mins arrived to the location 5 minutes earlier while waiting after checking in I saw people pay and get their pizza that moment I ordered one pizza. And had to wait an addiction 25 minutes after arriving. Not happy not impressed will never return.","Had a meeting near Cashman Center and we had 45 minutes for lunch. Jerry's Nugget was less than 5 minutes away and seemed to have good yelp ratings. Fifteen years in Vegas and I'd never been inside. I was impressed by the condition of the casino - very well kept. . I'd say the restaurant was 40 percent occupied. It took a few minutes to seat our party of three. About 5 minutes later our orders had been taken. . Simple order. Two of us had the Mexican pizza (basically a quesadilla): one with beef, other with chicken. Third party had a salad and each of us ordered a soft drink. . Took at least 20 minutes to get our food and the order was wrong. Ate it anyway due to time constraints. The Mex pizza was a large portion but unremarkable, even by coffee shop standards. . When the check came, I thought it seemed high. Discovered they had put two extra drinks on there at a cost of $4. . In short, the waitress was mistake prone and the food was just okay. Cost us about $15 per person. . Based on our experience, I wouldn't recommend it, nor would my companions.","I love this place. We order pizza from here about twice a month.  9 times out of 10 the food is good, but sometimes its a little overcooked and dry. This seems to be happening more lately. . . maybe its just a fluke. Ive been going there for so long I know they put out a great product, but I think sometimes the cooks just get lazy. They also have great chicago style hot dogs (with the poppy seed buns and vienna beef dogs). And the girls up front are super friendly - especially Kylie.","The only reason I will give this place four stars is because of the pricing. I believe it's a little over the top like you should at least be given two toppings with your pizza and then a additional charge for the rest, but that's just me. Anyways as far as the taste and service as received I can't complain.","My husband won't stop talking how great the pizzas are here. He comes here for lunch every Friday for the pepperoni special. I have to say the pizza here is great! One of the best kind. They don't have any modern pizza, simple/traditional would fit their selections. Be ware of the portion, one slice might equal to 2-3 slices of regular pizza. It has a gelato stand at the door, so it is prefect to grab a bowl of gelato after the pizza.","Great place if you are in a hurry to catch your flight. This Pizza Pizza is quick, fast, and easy to get to. I have never had a major problem here, except when there is a line, you might as well skip this place, and head somewhere else. The service is slowish, and the staff need to be more trained. Another minus, you have to pay extra for parmesan cheese for your pizza!!","It's not gross, but it's similar to Little Caesar's. It's like a half step above a little better. Has a thick, chewy crust and generic sauce. I wish that I could say more about this pizza, especially since the staff is very nice via telephone and delivery is pretty speedy.","So many things to offer on the menu it's really hard to make a decision. Ordered online for delivery the first time and I was mind blown with the concept of a pizza in a quesadilla and surprised with how good the 2 tons quesadilla was. Stopped in again today to try the Johnny Vegas philly fries and was very impressed. Going in they are very welcoming and friendly and food is great. Right down the street from my work so I found my new go to when it comes to lunch. Thanks again Johnny Vegas!","I walked in here just out of chance because I wanted to get some take out pizza. The employees are very friendly! The guy helped me quickly and got me a great deal on my pizza! I got a 16\" pepperoni pizza for only $9. 72 (including tax)! Hopefully the pizza tastes as good as it looks and smells! :)","This place is good! I recommend the chicken quesadilla or their chicken 4 cheese pizza. The quesadilla is honestly one of the best I've had,  seriously! I will say the nachos suck, they need more cheese. They have some really good fusion drinks which are the bomb. The salsa bar ous really really good as well. I'll  continue to come back","The people are friendly and always willing to go the extra mile to accommodate your requests on special orders. The Saturday night pizza is made with top shelf ingredients and care. I love the french bread pizza crust! While you may think this bakery is expensive, if you are a regular patron, you know you are getting a consistent, well-made product, made by people who know what they are doing and won't cut corners to sacrifice quality. From the cookies to the artisan breads, it is worth the price and extra mile to visit this little gem.","After travelling around Toronto looking for a place to eat on New Year's Day, we ended up at Epicure Cafe. I've heard of the place but didn't check any reviews before we decided on the place. . . some of us were very hungry. We got the Italian pizza (without proscuitto), spanish omlette and a burger. I didn't care for the mixed greens salad that came on the side of the omlette. . . mostly lettuce and drenched in dressing. The omlette was excellent and the pizza was good. Service was very pleasant but not so attentive as I think they were understaffed. In summary, I would go back.","2 or 3 stars for the pizza, depending on how desperate my cravings are for pizza. . BUT I am giving them 4 stars because I called at 8:50 and ordered a pizza. Little did I know they close at 9. The girl taking my order ran back to make sure they didn't shut off the oven just for me and took my order. Isn't that sweet? I thought it was because she definitely didn't have to do that. She could have easily told me the oven was off. . but will I go back for pizza? probably not. It reminded me of cheap pizza that you get at play places and it was $20 after tip. rip.","The woman who took my order over the phone talked over me and barely listened, so unfortunately it wasn't much of a surprise when I got a call from the delivery guy saying he was at the wrong address. Then when I told them the right address, they wouldn't deliver to me even though that was the first thing I asked when I called (and she took down the wrong address) and I was just a ten-minute drive from the restaurant. No apology, nothing: they just hung up on me when I was trying to explain how close I was. So I never actually got to have their pizza, but now I have no more desire to try it.","YELP DEAL IS NO LONGER VALID . Apparently this was a remnant from previous management . Had a large specialty pizza. We couldn't choose which flavor, so we went with their last option - EVERYTHING . The pizza was a good hefty amount of toppings  and filled me and my bf up very well with a few left over slices. . The girl who worked there was also very nice. . It was weird you can only get the specialty pizza in size large.  . They also didn't have anchovies . But they do have hot sauce plus your regular fixings (crushed red pepper and parm cheese)","Everything here met or exceeded our expectations. We were recommended some lovely Malbec wine. We started with an appetizer margharita pizza, which was thing, bright and delicious. They had a butternut soup special that was also very rich and creamy. I really enjoyed my salmon with the mushroom preparation. Salmon was cooked perfectly and it seemed like the best course on the menu.","Huge slices of pizza at around $3. 25-3. 95 per slice. They are seriously large slices! They have very nice choices here. I got the Goodman and the Plaza. Located inside the Plaza hotel.","Terrible pizza. It was as hard as a piece of cardboard. Just terrible. I specifically asked for well done chicken wings, they were raw and gross. They dumped bar be que sauce on top. Messy. Gooey. Raw. . This restaurant has done nothing but gone downhill. We all hated it. I am positive the wing request was totally ignored, double cook please ! The over done pizza was inedible. Avoid this place.","I would never stay here again. The hotel is worn and in need of a refresh but the problems were with the service. We ordered room service in the morning, waited for an hour then called to check in it. They said there was a problem with the kitchen and they closed up for the time being. They did give us vouchers for the restaurant, Urban Farmer,  who messed up our to go order. . The club level lounge was really worn and shabby with stains on the carpet. The spread was nothing special.  . Valet took forever to get our car when we needed it to go to dinner. I believe we waited about 30 minutes. . On check out day, being Gold I was allowed to check out at 3pm, however, they did not notify housekeeping and we received a knock on the door around noon. The housekeeper was very polite but they really should have notified housekeeping since we could have been sleeping after a late night. . The worst thing was the front desk person I spoke with when requesting connecting rooms- just rude. Nothing like the front desk at the Westin Pittsburgh who was so friendly and professional. . Customer service needs to be improved at nearly every point. We did encounter a very friendly front desk agent who gave us a great tip for pizza in Lakewood - Angelo's - which was a great recommendation.","The original Naked City is my favorite pizza on the planet . Period. I don't subscribe to any pretentious rituals about pizza, if it tastes good, I'm about it. . The Tavern offers a pizza experience that is close to the original location, however with a heftier price tag and a lack of competency of the original's cooking staff.  . An extra nice addition is when substituting an ingredient on a pie you get double charged. This is a particularly awesome feature that I hope gets embraced by everyone. . The locations is fine. Lacks charm, but is servicable.  . Our server was great. Prompt, attentive, and fun. . The wings were what we've grown to expect from Naked City, A-mazing. . If you don't have a large party, or want something on the menu that is specific to this location, you're better off to make the drive and go to the original.","Overpriced, mediocre food. I had a meatball sub which had more cheese than sauce. And the meatballs had no flavor - as if they were frozen and just thawed. It was just not what I expected. Maybe if we had the pizza they would've gotten more stars. It was just too expensive.","This place has a variety of items to try. Amazing pita wrap and salads. My friend tried the pizza and she was in love with her pizza. Can't wait to come back to try more food from crazy Jim's!","Great service and personal pizzas. Bbq wings were good and crispy  great beer selection for only having 6 taps. Beers were $3. 50 on Sunday's for a pint of craft beer","Saw an article on blogTo. Called them to see if the delivered in my area. The girl on the phone was very pleasant and checked with the manager before getting all my details. We ordered the T-Chris it was really great for a deep dish type pizza. The order came within the time frame she mentioned and it was piping hot and not soggy at all. The delivery guy was really nice too. They didn't charge for delivery so we tipped him large. Will order again for sure. Although now it looks like I should go have some ice cream too!","Today is Veterans Day, many fine offerings for we vets. Out of all places for lunch, I chose Humble Pie, with Schreiners Italian sausage pizza. . . . da best, Yum. Always a touchdown. . . . . . . .","I'm not impressed with this place's food, but specifically the bartender. I went on a Sunday morning with a group of four to sit at the bar and nurse a hangover. They had a decently priced menu geared towards lunch and bar food. . I ordered a cheese flatbread. I wish I could say I liked it but it tasted like cafeteria food. It was completely over-seasoned, under cooked, and salty. Although the pizza wasn't good, I got a taste and have to say their wing sauce is awesome! As is their ranch. . When I went to pay my tab the bartender asked if I liked the pizza and I was honest and said no (I had only had a few bites). He apologized and took it off the tab. I was blown away with how nice he was! That never happens. I'm someone who would pay for something that I partially ate no matter if I liked it or not. . I wish I could remember your name, Sunday Morning bartender on 3/19 :D You're the best! I'll definitely be back some time for a drink.","Had Chipotle for lunch today! Had a carnitas burrito and chips &amp; guac. Was fantastic as usual! . Before coming to this location, I was reading over the reviews and one caught my eye. Someone has left three one star reviews because she came in one day and had to wait because they were filling a large internet order they had received. She wondered why she should have to wait behind people who had ordered online when she is there in person. . Isn't it obvious? The person who ordered online is IN FRONT of you! They have already ordered! You haven't! How is that not common sense? She complains that she hasn't heard back from management. Why would they respond? Your complaint is irrational and wrong. How would you like it if you ordered a pizza online and came in at the agreed upon time to pick it up, but it wasn't ready because they kept letting everyone who wandered through the door cut in front of you? . You wouldn't like it, would you? And that would actually be a valid complaint and I'm sure management WOULD respond to that one. Your complaint however is false, so them telling you that is only going to make you more angry. That's why you're being ignored. Move on with life and try to be smarter and more reasonable in the future!","Maybe I came on a bad day, maybe I ordered the wrong things, but Sushi On Bloor, with all its rave reviews, didnt impress me. . The complimentary miso soup was great but the cones I ordered were barely full, almost no fish and the same amount of rice, my first bite was nothing but nori. . I also ordered a few rolls, I even asked which rolls were the most popular and ended up with salmon pizza roll and the university roll. . The salmon pizza roll was good but the university roll was small and again, had little content. . I am willing to give this place another try but the portions this time were puny and the taste wasent so amazing as to justify such meager portions.","Yes, on the pricier side than most pizza places, but the pizza was well worth it. The crust was amazing from their fire wood oven, and the service was impressive for how new it is. Definitely will be going here again :)","We decided to try Michael's Pizza Bar &amp; Restaurant one sunny Saturday this past summer. A little off the beaten path running through the South Side you will find this little treasure. First impressions, it's a quaint neighborhood bar. The kind of place that if you live close you probably frequent. I was really excited to try Michael's after hearing about their pizza. So that is where we laid our attention. . We ordered a large pie half cheese (for him) and the other half mushroom, onions, and banana peppers (for me). Now I am like every other red blooded American, but pizza doesn't usually impress me. It's ok, great to eat with beer, but I could never eat it regularly. When I get pizza I like it to be thin crust, crisp, almost stand on its own, with veggies. That being said Michael's delivered not only a pretty chill atmosphere but a pretty tasty pie. Matt really liked the crust and the sauce. I enjoyed the flavors as well, especially since they do not skimp on the toppings at all. There was a plethora of veggies piled atop my pie. This was good but came with its own set of challenges as the toppings weighed the pizza down, so there went my stand on its own factor. That was ok it was still very scrumptious. The one thing I really wish they would have done was use fresh mushrooms and not the canned ones.   . Funny thing happened as we were eating and enjoying some brews. A couple with a few kids pulled up outside. They left the door of their SUV open as their kids slept in the car while they had some pie at the outdoor table. I laughed cause I would totally do the same thing.","Stopped in for a plain slice for lunch on this sunny day. The service was great and very friendly. The pizza slice was huge and the base is light and airy. The sauce and cheese was the right amount. They also have sriracha which I put on top of the crust. . Very good pizza and good option for us working on the North Shore. They also have outside seating. Will be a regular here for sure.","Best place to see movies. I always go to $5 Tuesday's but you have to order online three days ahead of time to see new movies on tuesdays. Still very clean and the pizza and sliders are great! They even deliver food to your seat in the theater!","\"Fired Pie\" is trying to be the Subway or Chipotle for Pizzas and Salads. . From the looks of it, they're slowly on their way. . I've only been there once, and really enjoyed their Steak &amp; Bleu salad. Huge portion for not that huge of a pricetag, made quickly and pretty darn healthy, too!. I was literally the only customer when I was there, but I'm guessing it's popular based on the Yelp reviews and the many locations that have popped up.  . I'm excited to return and try a pizza.  . Based on my first visit, I definitely recommend you checking it out. . ENJOY!","Urbana has some pretty lit places to eat and the bread company is right up there with the best of them!! Pizza and grilled cheese/soup combo we're both really good and the pizza sauce they make is super DL tasty. Sangria is delicious too.","Sometimes  the success of a restaurant  has less to do with the food and more to do with the atmosphere. Food was good, reliable, nothing spectacular. Enjoyable thin crust pizza, very ordinary spinach dip - but what a great vibe. Exceptional, pleasant service, owner walks around greeting patrons, you can tell there are mostly regulars at the table. . My partner loved the beer selection. You will not go wrong here.","What amazing service. I ordered 3 pizzas and 3 salads to be picked up the following day. I was instructed to make the order they the catering line. When I did this the salads were the catering size. I only wanted the personal size salads. When I explained this to Gavin his response was no problem we can fix that. He was amazing. I will continue to recommend Oreganos","This place is EXACTLY what Surprise needed! I got the beer cheese burger. . . . . It's the best ever. The cheese comes on the side so that you can dip every single possible thing into it. GET THE BEER CHEESE!! The Mr. got the Fish Po Boy and loved, girls got the Mac and the pizza, both were so yummy. The atmosphere is so chill and we cannot wait to hit up some spring training games and head over for a delish lunch, dinner or Beers! Angela's Kitchen (the family's other restaurant) is a huge hit but this place is our new favorite spot.","I love this place. The happy hour is amazing $5 glasses of wine, 3 cheeses for $10 for a cheese board and the pizzas are phenomenal! I adore their patio and this is definitely going to become a go to place for me. Our server Shea was one of the best servers I have come across in a while, honest recommendations, very sweet and has a wonderful sense of when to check in on a table. Would recommend if you're in the lakewood area looking to try a local establishment.","I tried this place twice. It is pretty uneven. Service was choppy. Cheerful but our order was slightly wrong both times. It was quickly corrected. The pizza is OK but the crust is paper thin and the portion small. One pasta dish was great, the other was overcooked and dry. . So I see potential but some adjustments should be made. Pizza Brutta nearby does a similar style pizza much more successfully, and Cafe Porta Alba does better with both  the pizza and pasta. . The dining room was cozy and inviting. I hope they work out the kinks because I am really happy to have a restaurant in this location.","This is a great lunch destination if you work on this side of Cleveland. The service has always been pretty quick given the amount of people flock in here. I've had the flat bread pizza a couple times and the sandwiches, both were fresh, filling, and delicious. Besides summer and its expanded outside seating, I found that if you want to sit down and eat at the heart of lunchtime, good luck!  Expanded seating on the inside would be very appreciated. It was elbow to elbow last time where it seemed like we were forced to befriend everyone around us.  . Great place though, get over there and try some good eats!!","Margarita is the best!!  The garlic basil topping is phenomenal. It would be a 5-star if only they weren't so stingy!  One extra large pizza should come with one container of jalape\u00f1os. I order regularly and order 2-3 pies at a time for staff or family, yet getting a container of jalape\u00f1os per each pie is like asking them give up a kidney!. It's not complicated, one pie = one jalape\u00f1o container. Charge for extra for any additional ones. I keep going back bc the pies are so good. But if someone else figures out their recipe I'd leave in a heartbeat just bc of their cheapo attitude. . Overall, the best of this style of pizza in the city I've come across and definitely recommend.","My family loves this place. Just a small business, but the food is a nice (and healthier) twist on the usual food court options. I always get the pizza pie with marinara dipping sauce. My daughter loves the slices of flatbread they give you from the pie slack. My husband raves about the chipotle dipping sauce. Prices are very reasonable too.","The owners Adrian and Vonna are from New York and are Awesome and the pizza is the best I've ever eaten! Great ambience in their little place and I recommend Highly. Great experience. I will come again all the way from Utah for that pizza! Yo Adrian!!","DO NOT GO TO THIS PJ's!!! They are crooks!. The fool (Herbert) that took my call is just something else. I spell my name, say my phone number. . . And he still manages to get it wrong. . The CROOK part is that I ordered a large Pepperoni pizza and the total game out to $17. 03. . . I look at their board and I see I can get a specialty pizza with multiple toppings for cheaper. I was in a rush so I just paid and was going to figure it out when I get home. . Now I'm looking at the labels on the box. . . THEY CHARGED ME EXTRA PEPPERONI AND EXTRA GARLIC! . Pizza quality: terrible. The slices are uneven, the toppings are uneven (some areas are thicker with cheese than others) and omg the crust ughhhh . Never coming back here nor will I ever recommend this place. P. S. It is true that when you call, all they do is put you on hold and make you wait.","Centennial location: I usually give Mark Rich's 5 stars. Had a bad experience as the pizza had almost a cinnamon flavor to it this time and the pizza was no better than any other pizza here in LV.  Usually it tastes great. None of the regular servers were there and they didn't have their license for beer and wine which they usually have. Also the garlic knots were much smaller than usual and the sauce is a bit sweeter than usual.","Very good pizza!  The place is small and hidden in the corner of a plaza. It's family run, sparse inside. Their menu is decent size and has a nice mix. . The pizza is not quite thin crust, and a little bread like. If you like a bunch of sauce on your pizza, you'll be disappointed. The toppings (deluxe has pepperoni, sausage, green pepper, onion, and mushrooms) were really fresh and sausage has way too much flavor for frozen. The cheese was a little lean, I would prefer extra cheese next time. The sauce is light and a touch sweet. . I tried the Stromboli. It's done as a bread filled with cheese, pepperoni, ham, hard salami and peppers. It was great covered in chunks of garlic and Parmesan cheese. Better than the pizza.","A typical student eatery. Located literally across the street from the main entrance to UofT's Campus (King's College Rd. ) It's a good place to grab a quick slice of pizza and/or schwarma/sandwich before your next class starts. . It is a really wierd place, they only serve 3 types of pizza, Queenslice (which has schwarma chicken, peppers, n others), Pepperoni and Vegeratian - all of which are \"ok\" and I have never dared try anything else. They're also licensed to sell beer so if you're looking for that doozy before your most hated lecture, you know where to go. . Plus is that they have a nice LCD TV in front of the tables so at least you have some entertainment to keep your mind off what you're eating at the moment.","Oh my goodness, My second favorite pizza place and first favorite wing place. They have a much larger selection of Mexican food which is cool and different, but with already making great pizza who needs to try anything else?","Decor in this place leaves a lot to be desired. It's a mix of old Hiyachi booths and some new stuff which doesn't go together. Nonetheless, we are excited to have a brew pub with a great selection of beers. Because of the newness, they did not have their craft beers available yet, but we will definitely go back to try them. Food is good, but overly ambitious for a pub. I'm really not interested in having jicama slaw on my burger or sandwich. Keep it simple. That being said, I had a smoked turkey sandwich which was really very good and the 9 grain bread was outstanding. Would order again without the spread. Husband had beet salad and shrimp ceviche. Again the dressing wasn't great. There is a wood fired pizza oven so will will try a pizza next time. Service is spotty as the kinks are being worked out in a place that has only been open a few days. Went back a second time to try wood fired pizza which was very good. The problem was that it had to be made 3 times before they got it right and we had to wait 50 minutes for a pizza. A lot to work out on the service side in this restaurant. Would drop rating to a 3","Picked up two large pizzas last weekend. Was shocked on how big these pizzas are. Four hungry adults couldn't eat it all. Also amazed by how many TVs are in the restaurant. Will be dinning in soon to watch some football and eat some great pizza.","This is a go to staple for us. The staff is always friendly. Service always good and the pizza is awesome. However I go there for the Old World Classic salad. It's to die for with the house dressing. Mmmmmmmm","Want to start of by saying Kayla was an excellent server. She was very sweet and attentive without being overbearing. Really made it that much better of an experience. :). Besides that, the food was excellent! I had a not-so excellent experience at another location, but opted to give the one a little closer to my house a try and was not at all disappointed. The garlic cheese knots were crispy and flully and prefectly cheesed and garliced. The fried mozzarella was excellent, especially dipped in the basalmic it was served with. My boyfriend raved about their superiority over mozzarella sticks the entire meal. And finally, the pizza was delicious. Went for the Buffalo Chicken, it had the right amount of spice and cheese and the celery added a wonderful crunch and sweetness. The crust was perfectly crunchy and chewy, I loved it. We will definitely be returning when we get cravings for pizza.","My favorite greasy spoon in the burgh. Portions are large, the meatball sandwich is the bomb. Burgers are great and the pizza is homemade tasty. They carry a fine selection of bottled beer, domestic and imported. If you're hungry this is the place to go. Down to earth dining!","Arrived at 4:30pm with family to get some pizza (and a hot dog for my daughter). . Server advised the Tuesday special was order an X-Large pizza and get a medium pizza free. We ordered that special (and a hot dog for my daughter).  . Hot dog came right away. My daughter enjoyed it. . We waited an hour and still no pizzas. Server advised there was a mix up but it would be out soon. After another 20 mins, one pizza comes. But the free medium that was the cheese pizza still wasn't done. My son only eats cheese pizza so he didn't get dinner tonight. Server tries to apologize and offers free deserts all around which we don't want. So she says she'll discount the pizzas. . Cool. Glad she's trying. I'm fairly laid back in life so it's all good. . We eat. Pizza is ok. Free medium finally comes out in box so we can go now. Server brings bill and turns out the medium pizza isn't actually free. Server states she advised the manager it was her error but wasn't able to correct the bill. She was able to give us my kids' drinks for free. She continues to apologize and states she will have the manager come talk to us. Sounds fair. . She comes back asking if there's anything else she can try to give us because the manager won't come to talk to us. I laugh. A screw up is one thing - we all have them. But this is just someone that has no concern or respect for the clients that are trying to write their paycheck. . So I ask what the manager's name is so I could include in my review and potentially bring it up with an owner who wouldn't want employees treating customers this way. . Her response? Mark Rich.  . Ah, nevermind then. It's in fact the owner of the place that refuses to talk to his customer and leaves his poor server hanging out there on a limb trying to explain why. When my two young children asked why he wouldn't talk to me, I made the most of the situation by using it as an example of what it means to not have integrity and not be accountable for your own actions and decisions.  . Some people don't deserve to stay in business.","Horrible service very rude they can't get a pizza right If there life depended on it don't go there unless you have a few hours to wait on them remaking your order a few times they have a middle aged woman working the cash register not only is she ride but very nasty bad customer service and then they have punks working in the back that have attitudes when they messed your order up I will never go back there","Excellent find, highly recommend!  Fantastic atmosphere, good wines &amp; the pizzas were delicious. We especially loved the arugula &amp; burrata cheese pizza!   We shopped from their market goods, the sauce is great. My favorite go to seasoning that's in my kitchen is their basil salt. Great place, we look forward to going again!    The only note is they close at 3 on Sunday. The internet has 6pm, we went at 4:15pm and saw the revised closed sign on the door. We wanted to purchase our favorite seasoning since we were in town.","After searching for a pizza place around downtown Cleveland on Memorial day weekend, Rascal's was the only place open. I was leary after reading all of the negetive reviews, but to my surprise the food was good. The crust on our pizza was crunchy and the garlic bread portion was larger than expected. The delivery time was quicker than expected as well. A good mid level pizza, I would rate it as a step above Dominoe's, Pizza Hut and the like. So if the kids want pizza this is a good choice!","I've ordered pizza delivery a few times from Antonio's and I haven't been disappointed yet! Lots of specialty pizzas that you don't see anywhere else. . 4 stars because I did have some trouble ordering online, though. Had to call in","The wings were the best, I tried them a few months back, and I came today for their pizza deal. It was cheesy and good. The sauce was very tasty. They put in the care that only family shops can offer. Definitely recommend it.","Sauce is a solid restaurant. I met up some family there for dinner and it was relatively quick, decently priced for fancy wood-fired thin-crust pizzas ($10 or so for a 12\" pizza). We ordered the Rosemary Potato and Olive Pizza which was unique and quite good, along with a side of Mac and Cheese which was not so good - I expected a little more flavor or pop in it. Our table also ordered a italian sausage combo pizza which was good, and a corn chopped salad which was quite tasty. Beer selection was limited to about 6 choices. . Comparatively, I'd rather go to a CPK. But this is also a solid choice. I'd come back to it again probably.","Great pizza, fast delivery and the staff is always friendly. I've been coming to this location for years and it's still one of my favorites. They also have decent beer on draft if you eat there the San tan devils ale is a person favorite of mine and glad the had it on draft. Goes great with pizza and hot wings.","Owner and his wife are so welcoming . . they have great specials . the wings are outstanding. . the pizza I think is by far one of best. . Thanks guys for letting me share this place with my boys. .","Oh Levetto. . . I thought we had a good thing. . . what happened?. I came here for dinner last week and boy was I disappointed. Came here on a Friday night, there were about three tables and then us. The set up when dining in is a bit confusing. You get a menu but then have to walk up to the counter to place your order. Then, they bring the food to you. . I was a bit turned off that the server kept walking by spraying and cleaning the nearby tables repeatedly because I was worried the spray would get into our food. . We got the fumicato pizza and chose the trecce pasta. . . . What a mistake!. First off, the pizza though small seemed alot smaller than the one I got last time despite the same size. It wasn't cut evenly either, like two big pieces and two tiny pieces. . The Trecce was oily and not enjoyable at all. It was really disappointing considering we had high hopes for this dish. When I went to pay, I was asked how was everything. I said the trecce was too greasy and she apologized but didn't offer anything else in compensation. She just said that it is an oily dish because of the olive oil used in comparison to the other dishes. . I noticed one table got the comp panacotta's but two other tables later weren't offered any. I was finished while my partner was still eating. When I went to pay, I wasn't offered the dessert and had to ask about it after I had paid. The guy asked if we were ready for it yet cause we were still eating. Umm. . . I figure I've paid. Even if someone is working on their dish at the end, I thought you'd bring it out.","I bought this disgusting ass pizza today and it gave me a stomach ache. Plus, my mom said she found a hair in it. I won't be going there any longer. GO THERE AT YOUR OWN HEALTH RISK.","Are you looking for a menu with a wide variety to satisfy your hunger?

Ingredients taste soo fresh and the way the pizza layered made it even better!  We also ordered breadsticks and side salad which were also amazing. I think their dressing is made in house!  Would highly recommend this place to anyone. Try it if you haven't already. . .","Seriously the best pizza I've ever had in my life,   amazing craft beer selection. Service was amazing as well.  thank you Rosa, you were amazin we will be back again and again and again.   my husband loved the sauce so much he said he would get an iv drip of it if he could and my daughter called it magic pizza.","If I could give this place a 0 I would. . We have had countless problems with this location. We got a free pizza through the app and when my bf went to pick it up they tried to make him pay for it. Then when we tried it again they tried to give us the same pizza that was sitting there for half an hour. I contacted head office and got a coupon for a free pizza which I gave away to a friend because there is no way I will ever eat from here again! The people that work here are rude and the lady at the cash seems like she has no clue what's going on. . DO NOT EAT FROM THIS LOCATION!","Amazing pizza. Probably my favorite pizza place in the Nation. Everything about it is good. They bring you nothing short of a perfect pizza. It's such a good thing crust pizza. Very happy. Highly recommend","Did you know that on Thursdays Dragon Fire Pizza Truck is at Triptych? . Now you know that. . Did you know that on Thursdays, Triptych runs one of their beers through a Randall? (do you know what a randall is?) (a randall is a device, sold by Dogfish Head, that infuses things into beer. Kind of like a reverse water filter, instead of taking impurities out, it puts other things in). . Now you know that too. . I believe this week, triptych will be doing the Red-5 with ginger/lemon tea. This would go great with a pizza. Next week, they are looking to do Sprung with Pineapple (which would go great with a Hawaiian pizza, don't you think?). Try the green snot pizza, I hear it's amazing!","We popped in for dinner yesterday with no reservation, and despite the place being packed, the staff still managed to find us a table for two. The inside is cozy: exposed brick, fairy lights, and big red leather chairs. . THE GOOD:. - Fresh bread while waiting for our food - yum!. - We had the charcuterie board as our starter, which came with pears, walnuts, olives, and a side of honey to drizzle over everything. This was delicious - my favourite was the blue cheese, which was strong but not overly pungent. . - The star of the show was my entr\u00e9e: the pear and gorgonzola pizza. It took me forever to decide on what to order - there are so many amazing pizza and pasta choices - but this did not disappoint. It had a thin crust, a very generous amount of cheese, and the pears added a really nice sweetness. They serve it with a pizza cutter, so you can cut the slices to your liking - I thought that was a nice touch (even though I was terrible at cutting it neatly). . - We were in good hands with our server. He was attentive without being overly chatty. . THE BAD: . - My boyfriend had the seafood fettuccine. It was good, but the sauce was a little on the watery side. We would recommend sticking to the pizzas or trying another pasta dish. . Overall, April\u00e9 Bambina is an awesome spot in a neighbourhood that doesn't have many Italian options. I would definitely come again.","The pizza is decent, but delivery is an epic failure. Put an order online at 6:50 PM.  Estimated delivery was 7:50 PM, which is long to begin with considering that Wolfman is only 2 miles away from my address. At 8:00 PM called and was told the order went out the door. At 8:20 PM called and was told general manager was now delivering the pizza. At 8:50 PM (2 hours after ordering) called again and found out the order was never pulled from online. Bad process and bad employees who lied twice times. . Pizza maybe, technology no. Don't order from Wolfman unless you are going to sit there or pick it up yourself. . Epic fail!","This place might be okay if you're just getting a slice, but don't get a whole pizza, the quality isn't there. Crust is very very dry and chewy, pizza has very little flavor,  definitely not worth paying $14-16 for a whole one of these pizzas. This is for fast fill-ups while taking a break from  playing slots. The pizza chain they had in here before was better. Slices is totally forgettable pizza. Only tried the pizza, so can't  comment on anything else on the menu. I wish they would get a really good pizza chain in here, but that probably won't ever happen.","I've been to hot rocks twice now, and the second visit was even better than the first. . We started off with the Hawaii Five O pizza, which was really good. I asked for the calamari to be prepared gluten free and they were excellent - nicely seasoned, not overcooked and served with a wonderful chipotle aioli. I had the lamb shank - nice, tender, flavourful reduction, with cauliflower garlic mash potatoes. My wife had the Caesar salad and the beef brisket - the salad was very well done, not overpowering or over-sauced. The brisket was also really good, flavourful and with enough fat left on it to keep it tender and not too stringy. . The wine list features a good selection of very reasonably priced choices. . We left pretty full and pretty happy. . Highly recommended!","Just realized even after the many times I've been here I never wrote any reviews. So first off if you're going to order anything make sure you get some dessert because the zeppole is to die for it's so good and you get a ton of it so theres plenty to take home afterwards. (Warms up great in a toaster oven just add more sugar) their pizza is really tasty, it has a ton of cheese which I love, their sandwiches are a good size for the pricing and their pasta is great definitely worth the wait. I dont think I've encountered any foods that I dont like here.","Not bad pizza when you get it hot. Couple times its been real bad. Raw once and another time used make shift sausage. Cheese must be cheap since its never gooey unless very hot. But its ok pizza. .","Best pizza, salad, and bruschetta this side of the Valley. We took out 3 pizzas, salad, and three different bruschetta. Loved everything! So, so good. . . Went there to eat with family last night. Food was wonderful! I love this place, and how it is perfect for families, or a special date night. Everyone that works there is pleasant, and so very helpful. This has now become my favorite place!","I was looking for something a little different than the usual pizza places. I found this place online and decided to order their supreme pizza. WOW! Best pizza that I have ever had, and I have had a lot :p The crust was super soft with a little crip on the edges, and not too thick! The sauce just the right amount . TONS of cheese and I didn't even order extra cheese. Give it a try, you will be hooked.","Best pizza ever on Friday night Feb 17!!  Perfectly cooked pan pizza and loaded with toppings! Thanks guys","$11 for a mediocre cheeseburger, $12 for a small slightly better than frozen pizza with my Harrah's total rewards players card. You must be kidding me? No value conscious food choices in entire Rio Hotel. No wonder it is empty. Hope the place closes unless they decide to give their guests better more reasonably priced options to eat. I'll do my part and not spend here anymore until they shape up or shut their doors.","Consistently great pizza, service and prices - you can't really go wrong with this gem of a place! The Margherita pizza is perfection!","Came here for dinner while staying at the Venetian. Super easy to grab a reservation ahead of time via OpenTable. Our waiter was great - friendly and attentive. Food was good too. No kids menu, but our kids liked the pepperoni pizza they shared. I wolfed down my linguine with clams (they give lots of clams), and my wife really liked her chicken salad. The free garlic knots were good too.","We were visiting from Ca it reminded us of a pizza/Italian version of an upscale Chipolte sylte dining. Not bad. Food was pretty good considering that is was a walk up counter.","Well I didn't even get to try quality while I was here because the service was horrible. My friend and I decided to get a pizza at around 11pm. So we came here. Lobby was closed and we order from the walk up window. The lady \"helping\" people out that night was so rude that after I ordered I decided to cancel my order. She basically threw my money back at me without a single word. . Update** . Dominos staff emailed me to correct the problem. Then the store supervisor, John, called me and apologized. He then offered me a free meal for the trouble I went through with the staff. He was awesome. The pizza was good dominos quality.","This museum rocks!. It's large, well put together, clean, and just all-around beautiful. . I have always been a fan of this museum, but there have been updates within the past year or so that have made it even better. . 1. The atrium is beautifully done. . . the air just feels crisp and fresh as you walk inside. It's spacious, there is plenty of room for big groups to mingle. I actually saw a wedding party there when I visited last! That's right--- this space is rentable if you're into that. . 2. The cafe really upped their game. It's about as much as you'd expect to pay for food at a place like this ($$$), except it's actually tasty. At the Natural History Museum, the food is pretty mediocre, like a school lunch. Here, you can pay that same price, but for stone oven pizza, fancy quinoa salad, plus I'm pretty sure it's a rotating menu. (Different items for different days!) I know food isn't really a priority for most museum goers, the art is typically what you're going for. But that just makes this cafe even more impressive! . 3. Gallery One. It's a genius way of incorporating art with technology. I see it like this: kids don't typically like art museums. Why? Because you're not allowed to touch anything. You have to stare at a piece of art drawn by some guy you're too young to know or care about. Gallery One challenges that idea with placing tablets along the walls, allowing children (and adults too, of course!) to interact directly with a piece of art. Finally, kids can touch the art! They can display it largely on the wall too, which is always cool, especially if it's a Chuck Close piece. There are facts given and games to play. It's such a brilliant idea!. So these new(ish) additions along with the original reasons why I love this place (it's free, it's large, it's diverse) really make this museum top notch. . Things like this are making Cleveland better and better and I am so proud to say I live here. :)","Service was good. . Decor is very nice: trendy and original. . So why a one star rating? The food. Ultimately, that's all that counts. . Uninspired menu, just copying what is already out there but with less quality. Pizza dough is not good. . . Chewy and tasteless. Even the wood fire oven can't save it. We tried 4 different kinds of pizza and we all remained unimpressed with the toppings. Simply not flavourful. . If this is the type of pizza you like, stick to Brigade or Bottega, which are better choices. If you feel like exceptional pizza, stick to Napoletana on Dante. . Sorry to be so harsh. . . But it's just not worth.","I am beyond displeased with this pizza hut. I had an order placed (a friend from Italy had placed the order) Not only did I not get my pizza, but I didn't even get a call. Now they won't replace the order. How fantastic is that? Not at all. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PIZZA HUT EVER","After reading all the great reviews and seeing a youtube clip on Facebook of a comedy sketch by the owners son, I had to give it a try. It was late Wednesday night around 9:30 pm, restaurant was almost full which is always a good sign. We ordered an all dressed pizza and caesar salad. They started us off with a  spicy sauce and some bread, which was nice. Then brought us our order, the caesar salad had too many dark green roman leafs and the sauce wasn't that great. Then came the pizza, very oily, both the cheese and the dough. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad place but for me it did not live up to the hype. Maybe they were having a bad night. All I know is I Will be sticking to pizza Napoletana.","Barro's is our favorite pizza for family night and we love their generous and meaty boneless wings.","We had reservation at this place. When we got inside, the hostess tried to seat us at a table near the door, it was cold outside so we asked for another table since the restaurant was half empty. The decor is generic-upscale wanna be, there's nothing ethnic or cute about it. . We love Greek and Mediterranean food in general. We were very interested in this place and their take on that type of food. I'd say after dinning at this place that we enjoyed their appetizers more than their regular entrees. Their menu is too much of a mix of things, tries to please too much: pizza, pasta, some Greek dishes. . For appetizers we got the fried zucchini and eggplant chips (they were very good) w. cucumber yogurt and the meatballs (they're just OK). . For entrees we chose their pork chops (read good things about them) which were big, too much meat, dry, kind of bland, I couldn't sense the lemon flavor or coriander (they were supposed to have). Their fries were good. The coleslaw with olives (not the most Greek idea for a dish in the world) came later, way after they brought the pork chops with the Greek Fries. If I pay around $20 for an entree, I want all the components  that are listed in the menu to be brought in the same time (it's just coleslaw). . The service wasn't that great, they don't bring the coleslaw when they're supposed to, but then they keep coming to your table to rush you to finish the food with a typical question:\" Still working on it?\" - I'm eating, not \"working\". Overall, this place doesn't have flavor in their food as well as in their decor. . The food lacks the Mediterranean flavors and the place lacks the Mediterranean fun!","I love Barron's pizza!  Great crust and hearty pizza. They also have great wings. I've been going to this locations since I was just a little kid. Its always clean and the atmosphere is perfect for those wanting to watch sports while eating dinner.","Walk in and you are instantly transported to a New York Pizza Shop!! The smell is heavenly as you walk past a pizza artist throwing a crust in the air. Sit down and look at the pictures covering the walls and then be sure to order some garlic cheese bread! The marinara is beyond fantastic!! So dip away! I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo the minute I found out that the alfredo is made In House. I'm tellin' ya right now. . it is the stuff dreams are made of! Cheesy, buttery and creamy. . and pasta cooked to  Al dente perfection! Your eyes will roll into the back of your head. Then there's this charming man. . Mr. Mark Rich. . he'll shake your hand and tell you a joke. . makes you feel right at home! So be transported . . to a little homemade Italian NY restaurant. . right here in Summerlin Nevada! What a treasure this place is!","For breakfast buffets, regular lunch and regular dinner, this place is just fine. Service is above average. Presentation is always lovely, with as much thought given to appearance as to taste. The atmosphere is pleasant too, with spacious seating and high ceilings to complement the fine dining. Some standard menu items I recommend are grilled calamari, nachos and thin crust pizzas. I will definitely return to try other dishes. After reading the reviews on high tea and Sunday brunch, I thought I would offer my positive experience with their standard menus. As one reviewer says, if you come in with realistic expectations, you're less likely to be disappointed. Another reason I like this place is its convenient location near my office at Warden &amp; Hwy 7.","Went to Oregano's for dinner on New Year's Day to start the year out right. They were really busy, as they always are. The hostess quoted our wait to be 1 hr to 1 hr 10 min. It was very cold outside, but I was dressed warmly and they had the heaters on so it wasn't too bad. A guy brought out pizza samples a couple of times for the people waiting. Always appreciated. My friend went inside to get me a glass of water from the bar. Our wait only ended up being 45-50 min. It's amazing the crowds that Oregano's brings in and how many people are willing to wait. I really wish they operated in bigger buildings. I'm sure they do it for the ambiance (and maybe cost of the space), but they would be successful in a larger space too. I know I would eat here more often if the wait times were shorter. . When we got to our table, I had to switch chairs because the one looked like it had grease on it. . . then my chair wobbled--I think the tiles were uneven. Small annoyances. Also the lighting was very dim and I used my phone to light up the menu. We ordered the garlic cheese bread with marinara. . . that is a must for a visit at Oregano's. When it came out, it was really garlicky! It always is, but I think this one was at another level. Very tasty though. For my entree, I ordered the Bollo Pasta (angel hair) with meatballs. This dish is actually unlimited but I can never get through one bowl after the garlic bread and still save a little room for Pizookie! I love the peanut butter chocolate chip they have now, but we got the original chocolate chip. Didn't even finish it. . . I was so full! Looking forward to the opening of the Goodyear location. . One other comment I have is about the Zany Ziti. . . now I'm not a pasta expert, but I know the pasta they use for this dish is diagonal cut, not square cut as I know ziti to be. Not sure why they call it ziti if it's actually penne?","New owners much more friendly than previous, pizza is always good and wait staff always friends reviews about wait staff being frustrated at closing. . . . wouldn't you be","We love the food &amp; environment. The buffalo chicken pizza is amazing and the desserts are really good too!","I had a really good Thai pork pizza here. Waiter was very personable. We were able to get in with a party of 4 on the Friday night of graduation weekend without a reservation around 5pm- didn't think it was possible given how popular this place is. My family had been there before and said the beer battered bacon appetizer was amazing, so we ordered it and it didn't quite live up to the memories of it. Lots of beers and wines, but appeared to not have ciders.","This is a cute restaurant a lot like fired pie which I do enjoy more. You can build your pizza and salad they bake it in a very hot oven. The whole process is very quick, and it has a lot of appeal for people that are getting a quick lunch. They do have a Tuesday special where they have six dollar pizzas. It's all day Tuesday so that's nice. . So if you catch their specials it's a good deal.","Sad to learn that there are only 2 Pho places near the office. . . North Scottsdale developers are you listening? Enough of the chains! Enough of the fast food! Enough of the same old same old!. But I digress. . . . It was a small, clean comfortable restaurant situated next to a carwash. Now that I know where it is - I won't forget ;0). The employees are very fast, friendly and helpful. We were promptly seated, given water within a couple of minutes and our water was back to get our order quickly. . Two of us got the Pho (one meatball, one steak) and the other in our party got the lemongrass chicken. . I'm relatively new to the Pho craze, but I have to say this is by far the best I've had. And it was all in the broth. So full of flavor you could literally taste the hours and hours of work put into it. The steak was perfect!! My colleague wasn't crazy about her meatballs and vowed to try the steak next time. . The three of us split an order of the spring rolls which were amazing. . I can't say enough about the broth - like crust on a pizza - the broth makes or breaks the Pho. . We will DEFINITELY be back!","Wow. Exceeded my expectations!. Was a bit hesitant about the assembly line pies after having terrible pizza at MOD, but was I pleasantly surprised! Nothing like fired pie or other chain pizzas. The crust was perfect (wood fired) and they use San Marzano tomatoes and fresh mozzarella, among other premium ingredients. You can have a pie off the menu or create your own. We had four different ones and all were delicious! Pies start at $7. 99 and they are a decent size for personal pizzas. . Char has a bar, in addition to offering a few beers on tap where you pay. There is also cannoli, made fresh daily, and it is amazing. Franco, the owner, came around to check on patrons and he talked to us for a while, which was really cool. Always nice to feel your business is appreciated. . We've been here three times already and they haven't been open a month yet. Pretty sure we've also sent a dozen or so people in so far, since we can't keep a good thing a secret. . Thank you for bringing a unique, quality pizzeria to the area!","Hung out with some friends here this past Saturday night for the first time. This unassuming pizza place is right down the street from our house and provides a quick \"go to\" for some good food and excellent service. . We had such an enjoyable time sitting on the patio having a couple glasses of wine (beer for the guys) and eating from very tasty food. I thought at first it would be weird on the patio with the parking lot right there, but it really didn't bother any of us and we kind of forgot where we were for awhile. . . so, don't let the location deter you from going here!  . As far as the food is concerned. . . we all shared the stuffed mushroom appetizer and bruchetta. Both were good and somewhat unique. The mushroom was stuffed with italian sausage, which I love, and the brushetta was make your own on pizza bread. I was pleased with both appetizers and their prompt service. In addition to little noshes, we all shared 3 pizzas, the buffalo chicken, a pesto with sausage, and plain cheese. I've got to say the pesto was my favorite followed closely by the buffalo chicken. I didn't care too much for the red pizza sauce, just didn't taste that great to me. We also had the cookie dessert, which was mighty fine. . Since this place is so close and better than other pizza places near us (mainly humble pie), we will be frequenting here whenever we have a hankering for some good quality pizza.","Really good pizza and wings, delivery was pretty fast. Extremely greasy, so if you're one of those people that dab the greases off your pizza instead of indulging in its glory, it might not be the place for you","Food was good, but we'll never order from here again. My wife has severe allergies to some foods and on our delivery order they simply refused to honor our requests. She's deathly allergic to eggs and they put eggs in everything we ordered, so she ended up ordering pizza. I asked for my dish to not be spicy and they made both of them spicy as hell. . How hard is it to not put an egg in some noodles? It's not like the noodles laid the egg. How hard is it to not make everything so damn spicy? Don't put \"mild\" on your menu as a choice if you can't actually do it. . A nice enough place, but if they can't handle \"hold the eggs\" we can't risk ordering from here again and having our dinner plans (or worse!) ruined.","I have never had anything that wasn't top notch at Vici (I've been here at least a dozen times). From the fresh bread all the way around to the espresso machine you can't go wrong. . The place is always packed (especially at lunch and during weekends). The staff is polite and friendly. . I love the bread and the pizza. If you want a sweet to go with your coffee the biscotti are great. . They only miss the five star because they do run out of things towards the end of the day. Also on two occasions (weekend mornings both times) I went in for a coffee and every table was taken and a crowd so large around the coffee bar I couldn't even make an order.","I must first say Ive driven past this place hundreds of times and never ate here . It was wonderful the delivery driver accidentally took my pie and the nice lady had the gentleman in the back make me another on which only took 10 more minutes and offered me a salad which was excellent. The Italian dressing was great and the pizza awesome . I stand the sauce up with anything in little Italy and high quality cheese you can taste it . Crust just right not to thick . Kudos and thanks for the great meal Antonios!","Excellent!  We consistently have the most amazing pizza, lasagna, desserts. When we arrive in Phoenix we head straight to Sapori. Thank you Gasper, Maria and David.","I went to Tommy V's for the first time last night after reading about it on Yelp. It is in my neighborhood, and I wanted to try out a new pizza place. I love LGO pizza, but wanted to try some local pizza with a normal (aka not sourdough) crust for a change. We were seated immediately, and found out that there were still 8 minutes left of happy hour - yay! (HH is from 5-7; $5 wines, $20 bottles of wine) We ordered a delicious bottle of Syrah for $20 (normally $29. ) Also, if you don't finish your bottle, you can take the remainder home. Our server was friendly and helpful. We decided to share a salad and a pizza (note - if you have them actually split the salad in the kitchen, they charge $2 - we did not have them split it :) We went with the poached pear salad with blue cheese - yummy! Medium-small portion, but fair enough for the price. Hit all the right flavor notes for me. We had the asiago pizza with red onions and pistaccios. I had mixed feelings about this pizza. The crust (as someone else mentioned) is thicker than LGO, and seemed a bit soggy in the middle. It reminded me of a frozen California Pizza Kitchen crust that is slightly undercooked - (note: this is not a good thing. ) However, it was not terrible by any means, and the toppings were tasty enough. Just nothing really jumped out at me. If I try another pizza, I will go w/ the proscuitto and balsamic figs. I will be back though and plan on trying their pasta. . Also - the ambiance is nice - casual, comfortable and intimate.","Try Fresh co. Or No Frills for lower prices on grocery but they dont offer a 5pm dinner takeout. I had their takeout food and my crew responded as follows. Can we have Pancers Deli, Bones or Pollo locco next time?. The Pancers Cottager special is friday, bones does a monday special and I forgot about it so ended up at Fortinos in panic mode. Fried dried Chicken at $15 was a disappointment. Soggy sweet potatoes fries was sad. . . get a large as a tip and toast them in your oven. Ribs was more fat than meat and sauce tasted off. That cost me $40. If you want honest and authentic then this is not for you but if you are in a hurry and don't care about quality then enjoy this take out food. Now the rock a very good pizza if you can afford the 20 minute wait. Other than that their factory assembly line fast food kiosk is a sad experience but is appealing to the harried house wife. Why did i not trust my inner yelp and just grab a Pancers Deli or  Vinni Pannini bundle instead?","After reading the other reviews I can see Marcello's has been consistent. We shared the mussels which came with a tasty rich Marinara sauce. The bread with that sauce,  with some olive oil along with the red wine made it so we barely had an appetite when the entree was served. Unless you skip one of the courses, there is little chance of an appetite for the desserts, which would have made the experience better - the desserts looked very good. We wanted to have big portions of hearty Italian food, and Marcello's delivered. The service was fine since it was easy to get the servers attention in the one room restaurant with tightly spaced tables. There was a wait standing at the doorway for a table on the Friday. Nothing seemed overpriced and we will go again except maybe order pizza instead of pasta.","Love this place. . We got there to eat even though we are not staying near that hotel. The prices are not cheap but the food is good especially the pizza. Usually busy after 700pm the same staff has been there for  the past ten years. .","Great food and wonderful staff. I brought my 2. 5 yr old and 16 month old for dinner and the staff were very helpful, food came quickly and the pizza was delicious. My only negative was that the gnocchi was a little bland. I'd definitely go back as a family.","Great pizza and pasta in a lounge atmosphere. Fairly casual but you can see when you chef bakes your pizza or makes your pasta. Very good food at a fair price!","So far, this is the best slice of convenience pizza I've had in Vegas. Walk up, pick out a slice (I went with white pizza, one of my favorites), pay, pick it up, and eat at the bar next door. They've got a decent selection of beers on tap, with a few craft varieties offered I'd never seen before. . The slices are a good size and thin, just like NY pizza. Well, as close as you can get to it, anyway.","The Fairmount has its place. It's pricey, but the drinks can be outstanding. The pizza's are good. The staff is mostly cool!","Wtf one hour and waiting for a 12 in ch pizza. . Apparently new driver and nobody has his number. Really??? Absolute  Worst ever. absolutely incompetent. AAAND WRONG ORDER!!!! almost had a heart attack do not recommend at all. . can i give 0 stars???","Like someone  else said before, nothing really especial, just decent . . Try to keep it simple, I think their Neapolitana is their best choice. . My two friends had the pizza with procciuto and Arugula $19 each, personal size, it was fresh but missing a lot of flavour. A bit pricy, . I ordered one of their pasta dishes and it was tasty but the portion size was extremely small, smaller than a kids size, for this reason I found it over price as well.","Outstanding customer service, food is extremely AWSOME, pizza is made with fresh ingredients, and the pasta is made with love, casual atmosphere, great beer selection, supporting local breweries, this place is just superduperawsome!","We decided to try Zeppe's to support a local business rather than the national chains, and I can say that I'm glad we did. It's not gourmet, but I liked it better than Domino's, Hungry Howie's or Papa John's.  . I couldn't give it a higher rating for a couple of reasons. For one, the service was not great, even for a takeout pizza place. Just to clarify, there is no seating at this location, only takeout. There was an older gentleman in the back doing the baking who knew what he was doing, and he often had to come up to help the clueless teenagers up front. I presume that's why we got home one time to find that he had forgotten to put sauce on one of our pizzas. I could have called and complained and I have no doubt that they would have made us another pie with no problem, but I actually ended up liking it - It was like a giant black olive-studded cheesy bread.  . Zeppe's unique twist on pizza is their fluted crust, which makes for an interesting change from the usual - slightly crispy on the edges but still substantial and chewy in the center. I've begun to make my own pizza and have gotten used to a totally dry, stonebaked crust, so the greasy pan-style crust was jarring to me, but may not be to others. They are generous with the cheese and not too overbearing on the sauce, which is just how I like it.  . Overall, it's better than you'd get from the other chains and supports a local business which seems quite dedicated to the community, so worth a try on your next I'm-too-lazy-to-cook night.","This is the deal. On the whole, I'm really not that \"into\" pizza. As an American, I know that's considered sacrilege for some. Truth be told, it's just a rare occasion for me to crave pizza or for it to impress me. Well guess what? Donatos changed that last weekend!. We ordered two pies for delivery: The Works and Very Vegy. Both were fantastic. The housemade sausage on The Works is delicious and I really enjoyed the unique topping of banana peppers on the Vegy. Speaking of toppings, both pizzas were loaded. No skimping here, and sprinkled almost to the edge of the pies. And that crust! SO good--not too thick, not paper thin, and with a hint of cornmeal that gave it such great flavor. Nom nom. Donatos knows how to make pizza that is craveable, even for this very occasional pizza eater!","We've had a couple of meals and a few coffees here, and so far I'm happy. Yes, you can get a cheaper and better margherita pizza at Libretto, but these pies are pretty tasty (if slightly overpriced), and we don't have to trek over to Ossington and fight our way through hordes of hipsters to get it. . The coffee is solid; the space is gorgeous, all soaring ceilings and wooden beams (the building itself has a really interesting history as an old flophouse--kudos to the resto partners for rescuing the space and putting it to good use). I love the open-concept kitchen: next time I plan to sit at the bar and watch my pizza being made. The service is friendly and generally competent. . Most of all, I'm just SO GLAD these folks opened up in Chinatown--we live in this neighbourhood and the total lack of non-Asian options for dinner was really starting to grate on my nerves!!! Looking forward to making this place our go-to local for when we really can't face another bowl of lo mein. Yay for restaurant diversity!!","This place honestly deserves 0 stars but it's not an option. The pizza tastes like cardboard and tears up your mouth. And yes I've given them more than 1 try, so yes they're consistently bad.","I like Sauce, a lot. I like that for a 'quick-meal' place, they have a menu with a ton of variety. I like the brick oven pizzas, with that charred edge. The cheese they use is delicious. They have a new thicker hand-stretched crust, which is pretty good if you're offended by their normal thin crust. The hand stretched also appears to be a little larger, and is more filling than the thin crust, so it's good to share. . The white bean and potato soup is the reason why I only try to come here on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Yes, it is THAT good. . The pasta, salads, panini's are all good too. And they have a decent wine selection. . In the summer they offer great dinner deals. I believe last summer was a pizza, a salad and 2 glasses of wine for $20. Seriously, thats a steal and a half dot com.","Children's paradise. . Arcade, bowling, theater, pizza parlor. . There is even a little pub so the dad's can chill. . Theater is pretty sweet. Lounge chairs that recline into a position that is almost grantees you'll fall asleep. . Only suggestion: designate the seating in the theater a little better. I have had to ask that someone move from my seat mire than once.","My daughter and I always visit the Norterra location and my office from the Thunderbird location. We were in old town for a staycation so we decided to get quick take out for dinner. We ordered from our hotel room which was a couple miles away and then looked for parking in the garage. I'm sure by this time it was a good 12 minutes from when we ordered. A family of 4 was 2 ahead of us when we entered, rather than walking up to take out register we just waited; now we are a good 15-17 mins in fromm ordering. Once we got to the register we paid and was told it would be a couple mins. Needless to say, the family of 4 was well into their meal of pizza, salad, Mac and cheese when I went back to the register to find out where our food was. No apology, not even a look of care. I eat Sauce 1-2 times a week, but I will not be back to this location.","Go Pats! Drove into town from RI to watch the Pats play the Steelers and stayed right outside of Settlers Ridge. My dad and I got in late on the saturday and were looking for something easy and quick. Coming form a place known for good pizza I had sort of a bias. I'm also not one for chains, but I was thoroughly impressed with this place. The service was great and they even greeted us by opening the door as we walked in. We were seating right away and served very quickly. My dad and I decided to split the Philly Cheesesteak Pizza and we were both extremely satifisied. The carmalizeed onions made the pizza have that much more flavor and it filled us up just right. I ordered two drinks along side my meal and my father orded one. I was very impressed with the taste of the pizza and it was at a reasonable prices as well. Although a smaller menu, I will be back to one of these locations when I am looking for a great coal fired pizza at a great price.","We aren't seated long before we're offered beer, wine, and complimentary olives, mushroom tapenade and fresh red fife and pita. I'm surprised in the best way- so few places I've been to offer something for the table to snack on while orders are prepping and drinks are being poured, let alone something as delightful as this. The mushroom tapenade is marinaded and moist, not soggy. It's briny, it's juice doing well to moisten the spongy white bread and pita. The olives are firm, green, and drizzled with olive oil. I love the bread which is incredibly fresh, and polish off half the basket to myself, dipping the bread chunks  generously in olive oil. . . Mains are ordered, as is a pizza to share. Despite my conviction that I would get a pizza to myself, the pasta selection is incredibly tantalizing, and all three of us opt for different kinds of semolina entrees. . To keep things simple in the anticipation of heavy mains, and out of consideration for the vegetarianism of one guest, the simplest pizza is ordered- a classic Margherita ($13). In the traditional style, this pizza is only tomato sauce and mozzarella. Such simplicity requires the very best ingredients, which are readily supplied. The pizza arrives steaming, blisters on the soft and dusty crust. It's great. My first Neapolitan pizza! The dough is really the most important thing here, I realize, cutting through it with a knife and a bit of difficulty. Incredibly naan-like in thickness and doughiness, I felt like this recipe could have been passed down from nonna to nonna for centuries (it probably has been). Sensitivity and though has gone into selecting the fixings of the pizza. The buffalo mozzarella is melted and sultry, just adding enough sharp kick to work with the pool of fresh tomato sauce held in the thick dike of crust. It doesn't taste like PIZZA SAUCE, just like gorgeous vine ripe tomatoes, fresh and pureed with nothing to complicate them. . In a move mimicking her hair style, Amanda ordered manicotti. I don't think it was a deliberate choice, but the two big round rolls did look a bit like the big curl on one side of her head. In retrospect, I can see how drawing dinner like this might make Pizza e Pazzi a little less appealing to future patrons. . . we found no hair in our food! Not even our own. So forgive my drawings, sometimes I forget that putting one and one together occasionally equals eww. . Understated and simple, the manicotti was pleasant and satisfying without doing anything unpredictable, or being bold enough to really shock the taste buds. Soft spinach and ricotta stuffed pasta was ladled with that same fresh, sunny tomato sauce. It tastes sweet since there isn't too much salt, and everything is brought together simply with little added frills. The thick pasta makes it a pleasantly heavy dish, and it's alright that there's no side of salad to go along with it. The fresh basil leaf added a nice kick, and there was a taste of mushroom throughout. . Let's swing over to another extreme- the amazing experience Laura ordered. If the manicotti was a bit plain, Pizza e Pazzi went out of their way to make this spaghetti alla puttenesca ($14) incredibly bold. They combined the saltiest, briniest ingredients- puckered black olives shrunken with ripeness, juice laden capers (I've never been a fan), and stringy bits of tuna and zippy anchovy. The tomato sauce was lumpy with fish, just like mariners take on a bolognaise. It was INCREDIBLY fishy! I wonder if they needed two kinds of fish? Everything was salty but the tomato sauce was still fresh, so in the end it wasn't an overpowering experience- just bold and flavourful. And huge! What a generous portion of spaghetti!. I also ordered a pasta dish to myself, choosing the appealing sounding ear-shaped pasta, oreciette alle cime di rape ($14). When it arrived, I kept thinking of ninja turtles- it reminds me a lot of more of turtle shell than of ears! Dude. This was another dish with anchovy, a fish I'm happy to see get so much love on a menu (it's one of those oft-sustainable fishies). Like the manicotti before it, the orechiette may have suffered from a lack of boldness! It was buttery with olive oil, and bitter from the rapini, two flavours which did make for a fun back and forth over my palate. I wish there had been more to it than those crisp first notes. Even the spice from the anchovies and a few chili flakes left quickly. Perhaps it isn't bad to have a light and fresh pasta in the summer, but I should know that when I order pasta, I want something that leaves me feeling heavy. I enjoyed the smoky finish with my beer, and it was over all too quickly. Next time, I'll order something with cheese!","Every single item we ordered was bursting with flavor. My family agreed this was the best meal we've eaten in a long time and the best Italian ever. . To start, we were presented with a bowl of flatbread brushed with herbs and olive oil and garlic knots. We knew with the first bite that we were in for a quality meal. . To drink, I ordered the house Pino Grigio and my husband ordered a porter on tap. . We ordered the calimari appetizer. Perfection. Fresh, not overly chewy, and bright with marinara and a squeeze of lemon. . My daughter ordered a bowl of kids pasta, penne and marinara. She enjoyed it thoroughly. . My husband had the seafood linguine and was ooo-ing and ahh-ing with every bite. . My son and I shared the white pizza with creamy parmigiana, artichoke and spinach. It was magical, especially with lemon drizzled on top. . For dessert--we should have but we did--we ordered a slice of the chocolate cake. It was very rich and not overly sweet. It was a little dry to be honest, but that didn't stop us from eating it. In hindsight we should have tried the cheesecake. . The service was exceptional. Everyone was so friendly. We were even brought a bit a pizza dough to play with! My daughter thought it was a little silly but we got over it and played with it anyway. . It's clear that this establishment has a lot of pride in ownership. From the decor, to the service to the food. This is a five star place!","Okkkkk I just found this gem of a place . . . . . food is amazing . . I had the Mediterranean salad . . added chicken . Also the BBQ chicken pizza . . . . oh and don't let me forget to tell you about the margarita (yummmm) they use fresh lime! Please check the place out . . . good happy hour . Plus had the game on :) lastly wonderful staff.","First of all, let me say that I used to love this place. Last night we did take-out. Spaghetti with Marinara, Cheese Pizza, and Garlic Knots. It seems that take-out is not nearly as good as eat-in. The spaghetti was just fair, the pizza, meh, and the garlic knots that I used to crave, had little flavor. Not happy with NYPD at all.","The stars are for the cheesy garlic bread which is nothing short of heavenly. Waiter was very prompt and friendly. . . until our entree started to take way too long. We ordered the carbonara pizza. . . and it took a grand total of 50 minutes to finally get that pizza. The waiter did a good job of avoiding the table before it became blatantly obvious the order had been forgotten, and he finally acknowledged us. The manager was kind enough to give us a little discount, but it didn't make up for how horrible the pizza was, way too salty, with the kind of greasy taste that lingers for days. Needless to say I won't be back. Not worth the wait, and certainly not the price.","Grimaldi's is located on the second floor of the Palazzo hotel. This restaurant is perfect for date nights, families, big friend get togethers and any other occasion where you just want to enjoy really outstanding pizza. The atmosphere is classy casual so you don't need a fancy outfit to stop in, just a big appetite. They have beautiful looking starters but in my opinion why fill up on salad when you can eat mind blowing pizza. The pizzas are made to order and come to your table in no time at all. You barely have to wait any time at all and when it's finally delivered the waiter cuts it for you tableside and serves you your first ginormous slice. I highly recommend getting the bbq chicken pizza. I usually don't order bbq chicken pizza ever but a friend said I had to try it and I'm so happy I did. This pizza is stupid good. I could have ate the entire pie if I wasn't trying to be cute on a date. When you see how huge these pizza pies are you will realize just how amazing it is. The crust is the perfect ratio of crunchy/soft and the sauce with the chicken takes this pizza to a whole new level. No joke it may be the best pizza I have ever had. I am a local so I have been to my fair share of pizza places on the strip and this is by far the best! The price is not crazy expensive and the pizza is worth every cent. I can't express how amazing the food is here. If you want amazing pizza you must visit Girmaldi's!","Yum! We got a little flier put on our door alerting us that this place had opened right down the street. We kinda forgot about it, but one night we had a hankering for some pizza and I was too lazy to make it. I am very picky about pizza. It's gotta be a healthy crust, healthy toppings. . . . pretty much an all around healthy pizza. This place was super yummy and the price was good too! We will def go there again!","Its been 2 hours and we are still waiting for our 3 medium pizzas. We called at the one hour mark and were told \" its on its way. \". We called at the 1. 5 hr mark and were told the same thing. We are now eating the chicken i bought at the market because. . . . . . We are still waiting for our pizza.","One of best pizzas ever!  Worth price. . . beers overpriced. . . happy hour basically useless. . . random pizza and random beer discounted so can't really \"plan ahead\". . . . but pizza excellent. . . . 3-4 times a year type of place. . .","First and foremost, we had a wonderful and charming server, Megan (Beatrice - from St Johns New Brunswick). Arrived about 5:30 - gorgeous venue - exposed brick, a mix of hip but cozy. Started with the house-made mozzarella - made while you wait - yum. Its delicious as was the tomato jam. We decided to try  the house special. Lage, angus beef meatballs. They were exactly how you would want a meatball - seasoned just right, dense but moist. Just good. Huge, you only need to order one. You can get it naked, on a bun or on a bed of house-made spaghetti. We went naked and spaghetti. Pasta was yummy and filling - enough for 2 to share. Because it was my lovely mom's birthday, we got a free dessert - a molten chocolate cake in a glass jar. Very good, not too sweet but delicious. Perfect - fresh mozzarella starter, mixed green salad, naked meatball and a meatball with pasta - $49CAD. PS - saw the pizza on the way out - we are already planning our next trip!!!","Service was the worst I've experienced. I ordered 2 slices and a soda and was told that my slices would be brought to my table. I got my soda and waited. I waited 15 minutes and then I noticed a family who came after me got their pizza slices before me. I went to the staff and asked what was going on. They acted confused. I showed them my receipt. They got my 2 slices within a minute, but they did not apologize for the delay. I took my slices and left. I called the complaint line, left a voice message. One of the staff left a voice message. I returned the call, but did not get a call back.  . This type of treatment is unexcusable especially since at the time that I ordered and received my pizza slices, it was not busy and there were staff just hanging around. Although I understand that staff can make mistakes, the fact that they did not apologize but instead said \"So I guess you want your order to go, \" was just unacceptable behavior. I grew up in the east coast area, and if this had occurred at a pizza joint there, I would have asked for a refund. Since I was already late and hungry, I opted to get the slices instead of asking for a refund. Although the slices are NY style, the service is slow like the midwest and unapologetic like Beverly Hills.",". One of the new escape games that has been popping up all over Ontario. This one is the best one from what i have been. They offer free board games. The food were outstanding. Had the pizza panini and tried out the butter tart, matcha tea cookie and mango basil shake. The panini had amazing flavor. Gooey cheese with a great crunch. Butter tart was a diabetic attack in a bite which was expected. I wish the matcha peanut butter cookie had more matcha taste but overall had decent flavors. The escape games was challenging but fun. Awesome night.","Date night. We ate @ Picea977 last night. Everything was fresh and well-made. . The service was very good, helpful and friendly. . The salads were delicious. I had the beet salad and he had the arugula.  . And yes, the pizza did take a while, but we preferred the atmosphere to Libretto or Terroni's where I feel like people are looking over my shoulder to see if I'm almost finished ready to take in more customers.","Based on their fantastic food, I wouldn't hesitant to give Joe's 4 stars, but their Vanilla milkshake is horrible so they will have to settle for 3. I later found out via Twitter that the milkshakes contain a splash of lime juice in them because when the owner was a kid his local drug store made them that way. Apparently, the lime juice adds complexity and cuts out the richness. Are you kidding me? Isn't the entire reason milkshakes were created was for the richness. This is almost sacrosanct. I'm surprised the ice cream didn't curdle because it tasted like old goat's milk. . That being said, the food is finger linkin good and not all that bad for you either. Our group of four enjoyed the BBQ chicken pizza, Ahi Sandwich, Ribs and Onion Rings. Service was great and unpretentious, food was well prepared and fresh, and the atmosphere fun and upbeat. We will definitely visit again but leave the milkshake off our order.","My order took over 55 minutes to arrive. I had a pizza and some chicken wings, chicken poppers, and a salad. Everything was ice cold and even the garlic sauce was congealed because it wasn't hot or fresh and it it been so long since they had sent it out. The delivery guy tried to give my order to my neighbor because he didn't bother to read which apartment it was going to. The chicken poppers were cold and flavorless, and overall I was completely unsatisfied. I only gave it two stars because everything in the order was correct.","Rocco's has great pizza, and they are FAST with their takeout. My pizza order by phone is always ready in 15-20 minutes. The \"small\" pizza is actually quite big and a good deal for $9. 99 - they have a Monday night takeout special on their large pizza that is an even better deal. . The crust is a wee bit thicker than real New York pizza, but the cheese and sauce have amazing flavor. I am glad I gave this place a try because this is my new pizza place!","The wings are highly recomended as is the pizza. The beers could be bigger for the $ and the kitchen got our order mixed up so it took a little longer. Overall though the food and server were great!","I was looking for a new pizza place and found this place on Yelp. It's a small quiet joint and the guy behind the counter was polite and nice . The pics on Yelp made me think it was going to be not so good pizza. I ordered a Hawaiian i must say the pizza is really good. The pics don't do the pizza justice. I'll definitely go back. Thumbs up","This is our first time here, our server Steven was really helpful and recommend the special wings and pizza. . my girl is prego so she can't eat spicy wings gave us a recommendation of half and half on the wings! The pizza was good we got a sausage and cheese pizza. . . they had all the game on and the music from out side made it really cool experience!","Had the Shrimp Carbonara, and it was perfectly cooked pasta. Also had the California Pepperoni - one of the most unique pizzas I've ever had (sweet toppings with seasoned crust) and can't wait to have again. . As others have said, slow service but still once the food arrives, you quickly forget about it.","As a native Chicago area pizza connoisseur, I was happy to see a Giordanos pop up by the Padres spring training facility. Not sure what's up with the other reviews, our deep dish was ready in about 40 min and tasted just like I remembered. Give them a try, my guess is the rough reviews were in relation to getting up and running. We will be back next year for sure.","Yoooooooo!!!. I'm just going to be real. . . . this place is Fiyaaaaah!!. Next door to costa verde (which is also fiyah) at keele and wilson is Best Kebab &amp; Doner- a Turkish family owned restaurant that is just doing the most amazing things in the north west part of town. The furniture is not all that- but if you see the kitchen- you will realize where most of the money was spent for this operation. . Char grill, Shawarma rottiserie's , stone oven's for turkish pizza's and glass displays for fresh meat. You know that you are getting some quality stuff just from the sight of their kitchen. . Menu was also innovative- a 2 sided laminated sheet with items pictured and description below. It was very easy to pick what you desire- even if you are a novice to the Turkish cuisine. We ordered the Lazelar kebab and also a beef doner dinner. . The Lazelar dinner was an experience on its own. lamb skewer plated over eggplants and covered with cheese. My brain was amazed and confused. It felt like I had all my favorite things in my mouth. Am I eating BBQ? rack of lamb? Is that Baba Ganoush?? charred meat with melted mozzerala? what? So good. . . . . I cannot take anything away from the beef doner- however I would much prefer it in a sandwich instead of the dinner I got. The doner was a thing of its own. Ever walk in to a shawarma place and debate if you want a gyro or beef shawarma?. say no more fam- Booom! The doner at best kebab tasted like a combination of the both!! . Im adding this to my top 10 list in this area of Toronto. . I highly recommend it!","Day-One pizza is amazing! Prices are a little high but the taste usually makes up for it. Besides their amazing pizza, I also frequently go for their honey mustard chicken sandwich which is quite good. I'm not the biggest fan of their mac n cheese pizza (Ians is better) but their regular cheese, sausage, pepperoni is spot on. They frequently reach out to help the community and give discounts to teachers when they order pizza for classes. I've never eaten in their actual resturant before, I always have the food delivered although I have gone in to pick it up a couple times and the eating area- although fairly small- looks nice if you're just stopping in to have a slice for lunch.","Wanted a no frills, but good, pizza. Brunos is the place! One page menu is all that is needed. We ordered the garden salad. For $5 we were not expecting a full salad bowl, but that is exactly what we got! The ranch dressing was housemade and delicious. We were given an order of breadsticks on the house, also delicious. Our wings and pizza, the Real Deal, came out shortly after. All was excellent. No other customers dined in while we did, but several picked up and there were many deliveries. We will definitely come back and this may become our regular spot.","Tried the garlic bread and the Alfredo pizza with pepperoni on it. Really good! Service was nice and the food came fast to our table. :)","Stopped by after visiting the market on a Saturday morning and had a really good experience. . I was lucky enough to sneak in right before the lunch crowd started filing in, so we got a good table and friendly server with time to help me and my toddler settle down. . Then I ordered a pizza and a small meatballs appetizer with the idea of sharing both with the toddler. The pizza I chose was the simplest one: tomato sauce, no cheese and a bit of arugula. I loved it! The sauce is well balanced with just spicyness to make your mouth tingle, but not so much to light a fire, a bit of sweetness and a nice guilty/spicy note coming from the olive oil. I would have made it a tad less sweet, but I know I'm in the minority's there. The spicy was a bit much for the toddler: she tasted the sauce and made all sorts of funny faces after which she decided to stick to the crust. Which was also good: thin, crispy, chewy and with some smokiness coming from the burnt dough blisters. . I found the meatballs more forgettable. They were good, but not special. They had some nice porky notes as if they had bacon or sausage in the mix, but I found them a tiny bit under flavored. Might have been salt or the wrong mix of spices, there was just something missing. . We ended up at around $16 which I thought was pretty fair. But I do agree with some of the reviews that though some of the pizzas were overpriced!. Anyway, planning to go back with husband possibly to try the steel on pizza (sadly not available at lunch)","The other day I had a catch up dinner with one of the bffs that I haven't seen for a while. At first we wanted to go to The Gaberdine for some comfort food, but it was so packed we ended up coming here to Mercatto. Not too bad a fall back plan, I ended up finding a new favourite dessert here! (don't worry, I'll get to this later =] ). The menu is printed right on the place mat, and consists of 4 main cateogries: . Appetizers, Pizzas, Pastas, and Entrees. . . Table Bread. The meal started off with some complimentary bread. Warm and toasty, with a pat of butter; just perfect!. . \"Fritto Misto\" ($12) -shrimp, calamari, crispy chickpeas, smoked ketchup. Jess is a big fan of calimari, she orders it every time we go out! I didn't mind it though, and I enjoyed the lightly battered array of seafood that the Fritto Mistro came with. The smoky ketchup was a nice addition, but surprisingly enough my favourite part of this was the fried chickpeas. So crunchy and good!. . \"Arugula\" ($8)-apples, walnuts, lemon vinigrette, pecorino. We thought we'd keep our digestive systems in order by ordering a plate of greens to go along with our carbohydrate heavy Italian meal. I suggested the Argula salad because I love apples in salads. Not overly drenched in salad dressing, and a sprinkle of cheese. . . \"Spagehtti\" ($16) -pork meatballs, tomato, smoked provolone. Whenever I visit an Italian restaurant, I try to order something I can't make at home. But I guess sometimes it pays off to stick to the classics. The pork meatballs in this Spaghetti was delicious. It tasted freshly made with lean meat, and none of that other preserved junk. While I really liked the meatballs, I found the spaghetti to be lacking sauce. As a result, it was dry and bland. . . \"Diavola Pizze\" ($15) -spicy sopressata, tomato, mozzerella, basil. This was a  nice thin crust pizza, but was not very memorable for me. I did like the spicy sopressata that gave a kick to the otherwise plain pizza, but nothing too special. It also very quickly became unappetizingly tough and chewy after it cooled. Make sure you eat this promptly!. . \"Tiramisu\" ($7) -italian cookies, espresso, mascarpone. We were quite full, but decided it wouldn't be a meal without dessert!  I had envisioned the Tiramisu to be in cake form, so was surprised when it came in this small little glass jar. It is filled with balls of cake soaked in coffee and  mascarpone cheese. I really liked the cheese filling which was thick, creamy, and smooth. The cake balls, not so much. I found there was too much coffee, and so the cake was a little soggier than I would've liked. Still quite good though. . . \"Torta\" ($6) -lemon cake, blueberries, whipped. This second dessert we ordered I liked much better than the Tiramisu. It really surprised me how much I liked it because I generally don't like anything with lemon (It just makes me feel like I'm eating dish detergent!) But this, was just heavenly. A moist buttery cake that is not as heavy as pound cake, but light enough to melt in your mouth along side the generous heaping of whipped cream. The light hint of lemon went well with the sugared blueberries. My new favourite lemon dessert!. . Overall, this was a nice place to grab some casual classic Italian fare. You're not going to get anything too fancy here, but nothing sub-par either. Expect the ordinary. I think the only thing I would come back for, is that lemon Torta!","I know it's a chain but that doesn't make it any less delicious. And it's a great place to stop for lunch while you're shopping at Ross Park. The bad news is that this gets a bit of a wait during peak shopping times. . I've been seated inside several times but last night I had the pleasure of sitting outside and really enjoyed it. The weather was perfect and while the service was a little slow, they were very friendly and helpful. I ordered the white sangria which has a hint of mango in it and is sooo delicious that I've never managed to make it any further down the drink menu.   . I've tried several pizzas over the past few months and have enjoyed all but one. The chipotle chicken was very good although spicy and I also liked the roasted artichoke and spinach and the california club (minus the bacon). I know. I know. I'm probably one of the few people in Pittsburgh who doesn't believe bacon makes everything better. The only one I haven't liked to date was the five cheese and fresh tomato. It was very blah and there are so many local pizzerias and Italian eateries that make a much better version. I think the pizzas are a perfect size to split between two people (3 slices each) and still leave a little room for dessert. . Yes, dessert. Be sure to save room for the butter cake w/vanilla ice cream. It melts in your mouth although the calories and fat content must be through the roof. It's big enough that I'd recommending sharing rather than getting your own.","He was on his game tonight everything was cooked perfect. I have been going to Manhattan for awhile now and have to say as of late the quality had gotten a lot better. Pizza wasn't greasy at all, wings were perfectly cooked and sauce was hot and not vinegary like they use to be, the new chicken fingers are miles better then they use to be great flavor went garlic parmesan, garlic knots also cooked perfect not one overdone or under done. Will be going to Manhattan for pizza and wings now for now on.","listen this is what i dont get about yelp the food here is amazing the pizza is amazing they brought old school pizza back from Chicago just for us here in az and people are complaining about wait what do you people want go complain somewhere else. Such cry babys on yelp this is to review the food not the wait do you know how much time and preparation it takes for a gorgeous deep dish that this place makes but no people wanna talk about the wait guess what you cant always get what you want but with patience its worth the wait. It is absolutely worth the wait and if its not to you then come on hours that its not busy common sense which none of the complainers have this place is awesome with good food that me and my wife love so if you dont like waste your time somewhere else dont come here if the wait is to long get some oily pizza hut not this amazing piece of heaven on a plate if you have nothing good to say then dont say it peace love ya old school chicago deep dish thank you for coming to az!","My wife and I Ate there for lunch, sat outside. We ordered pizzas and a salad and shared them. Great food. Salad was fresh and tasty. Pizza was thin crust and full of flavor.  . Service was great as well.","This place haven't disappointed me and there are awesome deals if you use the app. This location is very friendly and pizza is delicious.","It was late at night and most pizza places were closed at that time to satisfy the craving. A large Pepperoni is about $6 and it comes warm and flat-tasting but with that price why expect much? . The girl behind the register seemed so miserable and that made me smile and reminded me how great my day was. Some frozen oven-baked pizzas from the grocery store taste better.","We've been ordering from Cenci's for years and the quality has really gone downhill. Tonight, we got undercooked meatballs on stale bread and a pizza so doughy, we couldn't pick it up to get it out of the box. This isn't the first time the pizza has been undercooked. The last few times, I've had to place it in the oven upon arrival to finish baking. Tonight, it was so raw we couldn't even get it to the oven. For a medium pizza, meatball sub, and delivery we spent almost $30 for an unedible meal. I will no longer give this place the benefit of the doubt based on how good it used to be.","Pizza is great wings are great. It's one of my favorite places to get pizza, and I am a pizza snob. The only downside, which I hope they see this and change is the way they handle pick up orders. You have to pick them up at the bar, which is sometimes very crowded. So with no open chairs, you have to flag down the bartender from over some guys shoulder, and then proceed to squeeze between two customers to sign the check and get the pizza. Not bad but kind of annoying because it makes me feel awkward.","The only reason I am giving this place even 1 star is because the bed is comfy and they have ok pizza. . . Other than that DONT STAY HERE!! From the second we arrived this place was a joke! 2 hours to check in and the line was not even long! The walls are paper thin and the beds don't get changed. No mini bar and the rooms are very basic oh and if u like getting allergies this is the perfect place for you. A little dusting and cleaning the air vents might help flamingo. . . . Also the pool open from 10-6 with at least an hour - two wait outside and u can't even take a bottle of water in! Now to room service all u want is a burger late night after being out but noooo the room service finishs at 1pm. . Yes 1 in the afternoon. . . Oh and don't bother wanting ice or to use the vending machine always out of order. . . . . warning travellers look somewhere else!","It's the best pizza in vegas!! Love the sweet little donuts at the cashier. . . great place great food!","We love Sapori!!   This is a wonderful, family-run Italian restaurant - excellent food and drink, friendly owners and staff, great atmosphere. The lasagna  is delicious, as is the pizza, chicken marsala, and everything else on the menu!!  The cheesecake is absolutely amazing. We had our son's 21st birthday party on the patio and they did a fantastic job of setting it up and feeding a party of 20!   You can always find Maria and Gasper in the crowd making sure everything is perfect. . Don't miss the music on the patio on Friday nights!!","My boyfriend &amp; I came here for my birthday dinner recently. We wanted to try a new place we haven't been after learning our intended restaurant was closed for the holidays. There's a good selection of drinks and cocktails. A variety of food on the menu. I got the Brookwood Club pizza - delicious! Though the crust reminded me slightly of Pizza Hut's, you could tell the ingredients were much fresher. My boyfriend ordered the BBQ pork sandwich - he said it was good but \"nothing special. \" Looking through the menu, seems like they had really good happy hour deals (which we had just missed). . Service was a little slow but it was also during dinner on a Saturday night. Overall, seems like a good local place. Not sure if we would go there again on our own though, as my boyfriend would give this 3 or 3 1/2 stars.","I ordered a Margherita pizza and an insalata di Ruccola (arugula) for pick up. Because I'm not from around here, I underestimated how long it would take to get there so my pizza was tepid when I got it and cold by the time I got back to my hotel. The salad was delicious and so flavorful that I didn't even need the dressing they provided. Had the pizza been hot, it would have been amazing. I felt it was a little pricey for pizza and a salad (a little more than $30 USD including tip) but no complaints about the quality or taste of the food.","Fantastic! This trendy king west restaurant was nice enough to take a couple friends and myself last minute new years eve. The owners were more then accommodating. And the food was amazing! Bread knots and apple chicken pizza were my favourites. The wine selection is endless. Highly recommended!","The Harmony serves my favorite meal in all of Madison - maybe all of the world - the walnut burger. This is not a hamburger with walnuts as a topping, no. This is a burger MADE of walnuts. I know it sounds weird, but I URGE you: give it a chance. It's nutty and rich and flavorful and I could easily eat one every week. Pairs perfectly with an order of \"Hot Chips\" aka potato chips made fresh so they come out of the frier still hot and soft. YUM! Pro tip: get the blue cheese spread on top of the burger (swiss if you're not a fan of blue) with fried onions, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. Welcome to heaven! PS: If you're not feeling a walnut burger (which you're crazy if not), Harmony's pizza, sandwiches, and regular hamburgers are also all top notch.","Their pizza and philly cheesesteak are to DIE for. Excellent food, moderate price, and good customer service. If you're looking for a little restaurant to take the family out to lunch or dinner, this is a great place to try.","You can always count of Oreganos for good, food and loud jazz music!. We lived in Sedona for 14 years so the Fkagstaff location was the one we would visit when we were up there for some Kickbutt Garlic Bread. and some Boom Dip. Add a side of giant meatballs and both of us had a meal   . We noticed at this location that the giant meatballs were not so giant anymore, we had to order 2 in order to fill up for a day of shopping. Maybe that holds true for all of them - a way to not have to raise the price. Still a good deal and they are delish. Their salads are still huge and the original pizza cookie is ridiculous!!!!!. Service is always attentive and my puppy loves getting a fortune cookie when we get home.","We are new to the area and called Barros for delivery. ( we have tried 4 local pizza shops and Barros is our favorite) They took our order but immediately called us back to say they were outside of their delivery area BUT DELIVERED IT ANYWAY!!! This mom ( who just spent all night at urgent care with one child &amp; came home to 3 more hungry children) couldn't be more impressed or thankful!! THIS Barro's IS AWESOME and their staff is the absolute best. If you want GREAT PIZZA AND AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE, then this is the place!","We went to this Oreganos on a weeknight. We had their \"big\" salad and had plenty to share between the two of us. The pizza was great! Nice thin crust and great flavor. The beer selection is great too. Service was exceptional and the atmosphere is nice!","We booked this restaurant for a dinner of 75 people on our wedding day. I am going to start with the cons because there was only one pro. . Cons- MISCOMMUNICATION! I called and spoke with Mimi and Joe about 7 times before our dinner. At no point in time were these items listed below were communicated to me. . 1. Kids menu-We discussed that kids were able to order pizza instead of the pre fixed menu. Upon arrival Mimi informed me that that only applies to children under 7 years of age. Nobody wants to argue on their wedding day but this was not acceptable due to the fact I spoke with her around 6 times and I was NEVER told this. She eventually agreed to this because I threatened to take my party to another restaurant. . 2. Adult pre fixed menu- The steak! We were not told that the steak cannot be cooked different ways. (ex. well done, medium rare, etc. ) Some of my guest wanted the steak cooked differently and unfortunately that was not possible.  . 3. Time limit- At no point and I MEAN AT NO POINT were there ever a conversation regarding a time limit! We were rushed at the end of our dinner to leave because all of a sudden there is a time limit. . 4. Cake- The cake was beautiful and delicious but I know for sure my party did not eat it all. The remainder of the cake was not  even offered to us. . 5. Bill- I work in accounting so I had the bill already calculated. When the bill came it was $500. 00 over! Most of my guest had already left so I could not count how many people were there and what was ordered so we had to pay it but I sure we were overcharged. . Pro- The food was good and filling. That's the only reason why there are 2 stars!. My advice- Communicate with Joe. He has an e-mail so everything can be in writing instead of arguing about what was said over the phone. Mimi is the event coordinator but does not have an e-mail which I don't like. Our argument over the kids menu was a he said she said because it was over the phone and not in writing. This restaurant has a lot of potential. They could really have more business if communicated with their guest properly. Unfortunately I will NOT be back!","Wow, tough crowd to please but I was extremely impressed with Cibo. Went on a Friday night at 7 and scored a seat at the bar immediately! Customer service was amazing, the bartenders were super friendly and helpful in deciding what to order. We were so entertained by the way their wines are setup and the different temperatures they were stored at. We ended up getting a bottle of wine so not sure how the cocktails are. . Food: we got a salad and pizza and everything was absolutely delicious and fresh. . I would definitely come back here for happy hour to check out the menu, and for dinner.","I'm not huge on eating at buffets, especially not after losing all the weight I've lost. But sometimes you just have to do it. Sometimes you want the whole \"Las Vegas Experience\" so you do it. . It was Memorial day, so the price was $25. 90, tax included. It was for lunch and there was just about anything you can imagine, from barbecue, to sushi (not gonna eat it, sorry) to made to order Chinese and salad, fresh baked pizza and grilled burgers. It's all there on the bar, some areas seemed thin and/or not in use and that's Ok. . The drinks were found in the center and I was THRILLED that they offered Stubborn Soda, which is absolutely delicious in flavour. They also offered a flavoured water/energy drink but the flavours on that were so saturated that I had to water it down. . The desert bar was kinda. . meh? That's where I expect a buffet to excel, but nope, the chocolate cream pie tasted store bought as did the eclairs (Which if you wanted to you could buy them for $2. 50 each. . uh. . no)  and the cream caramel cupcake was bland. . it was Ok.","I think this is the best Pizza Hut we have been to. The pizza was hot and fresh and not greasy. The skinny Club is rally good, the crust is perfect and buttery. We will come back here again for sure. Tiffany was nice and helpful.","Just moved in the area and discovered on of the best pizzas in Charlotte.  . Great service and the food is always consistent. I also recommend trying the Fragolaki (sp) seasoned grilled steak in a hoagie with feta cheese.","Great! For what it is it's perfect. Nice environment, friendly staff, awesome food, family friendly. Had the passion bread and a cheese pizza with two of us and was very satisfied!","Stopped in with a small group recently. I had the snapper which I found to quite good. Also heard good comments about the pizza. . Service was fast and friendly and the atmosphere pleasant. . Would return.","I was a little shocked at the appearance of the pizza. Granted, I got it to go. But it had white cheese and was super thin. It tasted \"ok. \" I'm sure I'll go back bc the have a great pino. . . but I'll probably order the wings.","This place is quite nice and has a nice modern interior design. Very inviting and the server that we had was helpful in terms of the menu. . Their bread is awesome. Good for sharing. l and as a starter. . Prices were affordable, not too bad. Then I got the chef's special. I was really contemplating getting the Mac n cheese and I should have done that because the chef's special was not so special at all. The battered fried fish was smokey and way way too salty!!! It was horrible. Each bite I took, I had to down it with water. I wasn't the only one who found it too spicy. A couple of people on my table who ordered the same thing had the same comments about. Anyway, it wasn't a big deal. I tries my boyfriend' s grilled octopus and it was delicious. Great bold flavours in there and the potatoes were delicious with it. Lastly, we had the poutine pizza to share and it was AHH-MAZING.  That one I was really happy about. . I would definitely come here again to try the mac n cheese now since I didn't get it last time. But for my first experience, it was decent. Just really disappointed  about the chef's special. I'm going to give them another chance to redeem themselves by trying it out again and going for their best dishes. Hopefully my rating will change for next time!","This place was fantastic! We went here for dinner and shared the margherita pizza and ricotta and spinach ravioli. Both were delicious and my husband and I were pleasantly surprised with the quality given how fast the food was ready. The restaurant also had a really cool atmosphere and ordering process. Great experience!","I really love this place in the summer. . such a great patio and amazing food. The waitress was very nice and recommended great dishes. We had pizza and pasta and both were phenomenal.","Awesome pizza. We just moved here from Chicago and my husband loves New York style pizza. Authentic NYC style, perfect crust, wonderful service and addictive flavor. Serves pizza by the slice and pasta dishes. Daily specials. Will be back soon and often!","First timers! . My boyfriend &amp; I stayed here for 2 nights in February. We were in town to see the one and only Misses-OMG-that-Britney-Shameless!!! (AKA Britney Spears for those who aren't on my level). I was looking to treat ourselves to a fairly new and modern 4 to 5 star hotel. I did my research and through all the casino/non-casino, resort fee/no resort fee,  floor to ceiling windows, 2 or 3 ply toilet paper, center/east/west of Strip hotels, I finally decided on Elara. . Location: Kick ass! It's almost dead center of the Strip. It's not right on the Strip but behind Planet Hollywood. I'd say it takes about 5 mins or less to walk to the Strip from the lobby. Yes, you do have to walk through the Miracle Mile shops but its not as exaggerated as some other reviews make it to be. When you're drunk, it feels like even less! If you're in town for Britney and considering this hotel, the Axis Theater is also about a 5 min walk from the lobby. . Parking: Elara offers self parking and valet. If you choose to self park, you park in the public Miracle Mile parking structure. My advice is that you try to score a spot on the 3rd floor which is directly connected to the hotel. Section 3A if you're so lucky. That's as close as you can get to the hotel entrance (just a min or so walk). . Now, if you decide that you're not about to go hunting for parking after a long drive and are willing to splurge for valet, its $15/day. . . for the length of your stay. I opted for valet once we pulled up. I figured I'd pay for the first day to make things easy. The attendant informed us that it'd be $15/day for 24 hrs. I thought, \"Okay, cool. I'll just pull it out before being charged an additional day. \"  After walking the Strip for a while, we decided to pull the car from valet. It was about 2 hours til our first full day. It wasn't til check-out that we noticed we were billed for both days not just one. At which point the receptionist informed us that valet is billed for the entire length of stay. Maybe this is a Vegas standard but I honestly didn't know. I wasn't trying to get it free; I was willing to pay for the first day. I made my case and thankfully a manager removed the second day. . Room: The room looked better in person. I booked the room through Travelocity. It came with an upgrade from Studio to Junior Suite. The difference is a bigger room and apparently a nicer view. It came fitted with a king bed, two TVs, a small dining table, a red sofa which doubled as a pull out bed, a mini kitchen (sink, dishwasher, cabinets, some plates and cups, and a decent fridge), a restroom with a jetted average sized tub. The pictures on their site led me to believe the Junior Suite had a jacuzzi type tub apart from the restroom but guess that's for the next tier up. . Anywho, our room was on the 52nd floor in the corner of the hotel. It had thee awesomest view ever! Floor to ceiling windows spaning a view from the Cosmopolitan (Bellagio, Paris, Flamingo, Caesar's Palace, Wynn) to the mountains behind the Strip. . Side notes: . -There's a $100 deposit if you're paying with your debit card. You get your deposit back within 3-4 days after checking out. . -You must provide your room key to get to the elevator. . -Check-in/out times suck! In at 4 pm and out by 10 am. . -No resort fee!. -This is a non-smoking hotel. There's a $250 fee for smoking in the room. . -Room service ends at 10 pm. Your next best choice is Earl of Sandwich within the Miracle Mile. Heard there's a 24 hr. pizza place near by there too.","I just went here after the remodel. Almost everything I had was pretty bad. Of the entire buffet the only things that were OK we the rotisserie chicken, and the pizza. Everything else was bleh at best. We went there fairly early and everything tasted as though it had been sitting. Even the things that were clearly fresh, tasted bland and unseasoned. The rotisserie chicken was okay, and the pizza was the equivalent of pizzahut. They do have a few make to order options, however non of them were very good. . These make your own options consisted of things like:. burger and fries. hot dog and fries. quesadilla - i did have this, and it was extremely greasy on the outside. It was almost as if they buttered the tortilla? gross. . asain stir-fry. and pasta dishes. I won't be going back, and I'm glad that when I did go I had a comp. However, if I get anymore comps I won't even bother going over there to use them. . Also, the desert selection is now much smaller then it used to be (however same crappy quality).","I was with some friends one evening and they were shocked that I'd never been here, so of course we had to go. Wow. I've been back probably five times since and the hype is lived up to here. Dirt cheap, delicious, flat-crust pizza. You definitely don't come for the ambience or the service, you come because you're hungry and you want good pizza for cheap. Two large pizzas for $24? Don't mind if I do! The garlic oil is, as others have noted, the best bit. This, for me, is the perfect pizza: a blend between healthy, classy, simple flat-crust pizza, but with just the right amount of cheap pizza store ambience and oil/grease/garlic. Mmm. Large margarita pizza please!","Stopped on a whim and we've been back for more only a few days later. Great pizza and very friendly staff. Went out of their way to make sure our visit was enjoyable and even ran out after us because they forgot to give us a menu and a handwritten thank you note with a coupon for free breadsticks. Plus they opened their doors to us 45 minutes early without batting an eye. Said they deliver much later than posted as well.","Last day of work, my coworkers had a Goodbye Party for me. We ordered Pizzas and Chicken wings from Pizza 73. It was my first time having food from Pizza 73. Pizza 73 has many locations in Calgary. The one we ordered to take out, is located on 130 Ave SE. We ordered two large 14\u2033 pizza and 60Buffalo breaded chicken wings from there. The prices were around $60, which was very cheap. The pizzas were decent. I love the chicken wings. They were all very juicy and tasty. Highly recommend this place for Chicken Wings.","Yes, you are going to have to wait 30-45 minutes for your pizza, unless you call it in to go. A large pizza will fill a family of four to five with leftovers. Had the deep dish sausage and pineapple on Sat. , July 7th. . Leftovers for lunch on Sun. , just as good cold or hot. . Great bar if you have to wait. Jacelin is very professional and checked on my pizza four times. Have asked the manager to look into serving Pione Italian beer. . Well worth the wait!","Thin crust wood fired pizzas with fresh ingredients. The best pizza I've had in a long  time. Devoured the whole pie. Amazing.","What happened to L'il Bacci? Doesn't seem very long ago that it was a brand new addition to the Leslieville strip, and trying effortlessly to please. Last weeks lunch though, didn't please at all. The pizza was mediocre, service was spotty, and the music was obnoxious. To be fair, the soup was excellent, but didn't make up for the rest of the meal. . A dinner in the summer was equally uneven. We sat on the patio and were attended to by a friendly server. While the arugula salad was delightfully satisfying, the spaghetti al limone (at $17) was not. Overpriced, and under flavoured, it was a dry and disappointing execution of a simple dish that could have been delicious on a warm evening. . Too bad, because from the outside, it's so pretty.","What a fantastic night I had at my first time here! There are lots of different rooms/rinks/areas in this place, so you can really fit a lot of people in here. There is a rollerblading rink, there are also ice rinks (I think there were reserved for hockey games when we were there, so you might want to check first), bowling lanes, laser tag, glow in the dark mini golf (Carly who worked there was AWESOME), in fact, all of the Rinx staff were friendly and helpful. There are also bumper cars with scoop ball and lots of other rooms as well. Great set up for large groups of people! I was pleasantly surprised by the good food that the Rinx staff provided: mini corn dogs on sticks, popcorn, waffles on a stick, pizza etc. And they were really generous, I felt like the nice ladies wanted me to eat more - not like some places you go and servers race past you! The only (slight) drawback is that it's not really close to a subway, but you could take a bus and then walk in from Dufferin St. (approx 5 mins or so). Really fun! Will definitely go back!","Great neighborhood pizza shop with great pizza. The service could be slightly better in terms of not being so rushed. . .","So this was my second time here, first visit I met friends for late drinks. They had already ordered food so I had a piece of their pizza which was good at room temperature being that I got there a half hour after they got their meal. This time I went forget takeout, so it was time to personalize my pie! My toppings were pepperoni, sausage &amp; long hot peppers!! Mmm mm mm, this has to be the first time I've had a pizza when the taste got better after every slice and no slice tasted the same. Now I don't know what that's a great description but it was amazing! Toppings taste fresh, crispy crust was perfection!! If your not a meat eater the hot peppers are a must! Going back for the wings real soon!!","Wow! The portions are crazy! The pancakes were perfection (and the size of a small pizza), bacon cooked to perfection and eggs (I swear they gave me 6 eggs). Either way, we loved it!","The slice counter is awesome! Great value on higher end pizza on the strip. If you are not a fan of the greasy pepperoni and cheese from the other joints, give this a shot!","I agree w/ Dave S. don't order the pizza here, BUT order anything else, everything is great and large portions! During the week they have beer and drink specials plus food specials, lunch is really good too, I have lunch at least once a week there.","Maybe they changed the chefs here, they refused to cook my usual order of seafood pasta with garlic cream sauce, so I opted for mussels and calamari instead. The calamari was a bit on the bland side, and the mussels were sandy and quite a few did not taste fresh. I think I'll stick to the pizza next time.","This pizza was great, it just had cheese on it but it was very tasty. The cannoli was the best I've ever had. People have said the guy inside is rude but he's Italian, straight and to the point. I thought he was very nice. Never rude, he doesn't smile much but he's always nice!","We have been waiting for this place to open for a few months! Now that it's open, we couldn't wait to try it. We were very impressed with the food and the service. Most restaurants seem disorganized when they first open, but not this place. We ordered the garlic knots appetizer and ordered the wood fired pizza as our meal. Both were outstanding! It's so nice to have this new restaurant in south Chandler!","What an awesome surprise to learn that my all-time favorite pizza place from my hometown (South Bend, IN) had opened up a location here in Las Vegas. Visited tonight for the first time and was not disappointed. I was fearful it wouldn't match my memories, but they really nailed it, especially their unique dough and the family recipe sausage. Met the staff and they were awesome and treated me and my friends as if I was back in my hometown again. If you long for the real pizza stylings of the Midwest/Chicago/Great Lakes region, make a point to visit Bruno's and enjoy the great food and friendly atmosphere. If you've only known pizza from the West Coast/Las Vegas, do yourself a favor and give Bruno's a try and taste pizza that is founded on quality ingredients, culinary skills, and the passion of the family that created it! A big thank you to the staff for making me feel at home.","I got the hummus chicken pizza, it was delicious. Substituted the jalape\u00f1o hummus and it was really good. Very friendly owner and great food.","Probably the best pizza I've tried so far in Woodbridge, and I hear it's been around for years now. Have tried their large pizza a handful of times now and with different toppings and it's always delicious. Pizza was served hot, has flavor, cooked well, good toppings used and appropriate amount of toppings, and the dough has a good thickness. . I've tried a few other pizza places in the area and for one of the smaller pizza joints it's been excellent time and time again - would definitely recommend!!","Pizza was good, edges were very crispy but very greasy. We had the Gotham pizza and they are generous with their toppings. Also ordered the calamari and it was just meh. I wouldn't recommend the calamari to anyone.","OMG This pizza as amazing it was hot. . . like still steaming hot it was here in less then 30 min and it was exactly what I hoped it would be. Don't know there aren't more reviews but this is a must have!!!","Seriously the bomb-est pizza and baked ziti. I usually expect really generic pizza from these Italian take-out places but this place is quality!!","We were having a conversation with a local pizza maker a few months ago about the varying opinions about what constitutes \"good\" pizza. He shared with us that one of the most common opening remarks he receives from customers is: \"I'm from New York . . . \"  . Okay? And?. I guess it gives people a sense of credibility and a perceived \"edge\" over others, who lack the credentials to judge what's good vs bad when it comes to this style of pie. Given that I've never visited New York and will unlikely be going anytime soon, I'm not entirely sure what the keys are to doing the pizza right. I've just always associated it with big, floppy slices of pizza that are foldable and contain dough that's extremely high in gluten. The quality, more or less, lies within the skill of the maker and the quality of the ingredients used.  . Some say that NY crust has a distinct flavor, which is largely attributed to the minerals found in the city water. Hell, I've heard that some owners even go so far as to physically import water from New York in order to duplicate this. That's what I call hardcore dedication! Apparently, NYPD uses a specialized water filtration system that allegedly gives it the minerals required to emulate the \"New York taste\" in its crust. Whether or not it works, I wouldn't know - but it's definitely a clever little approach and a great marketing tool if anything else. . As for their pizza, I actually don't think it's too bad in comparison to other chain-level options. Before the wood-fired and fast casual concepts consumed the city, I used to pick up pizzas quite regularly here. The crust does have somewhat of a distinct flavor and the ingredients are a notch above what you would find at many other places. In fact, I remember one instance when I went to pick up a pizza, the girl opened the box and deemed the pizza unacceptable for being just slightly overcooked. Although I said it was fine, she insisted that they make another one properly. It's nice to see some quality control in place.  . Is it the best pizza you'll ever eat? Probably not. Nor is it a place that I'd ever make it a point to visit for a Saturday night dinner. But in terms of the convenience and a quick pizza fix, I feel that they do their job just fine. . Unfortunately, I'm from Phoenix, so my opinion on New York pizza holds little value.","I have only gotten delivery. . . . pizza isn't bad, isn't great either. . . . its hard to get good pizza in Las Vegas. . The hot chicken fingers are my fav, and the wings are pretty good too.","This place is literally around the corner from me (don't stalk) and we've been meaning to stop in for a few months now. We finally went on a Saturday night, ordered a lovely salad (ended up being great, tasty, and huge - enough for 2). Marie was our server (she's from France) is is friendly, professional, and fantastic! we were brought a basked of bread and dipping oil while we waited for our food. She was the only server for what became a pretty full restaurant, yet we felt as though we were the only ones there! She suggested an (alcoholic) lemonade made with vodka (and gin too, I think) with some Limonata and YES! Order it! It was great! Then we ordered our respective pizzas. Very good. A notch below Pizza Libretto, but we'll be back fo sho!","Very friendly and great value for the price!  Will definitely be back. The employee on duty was extremely friendly and helped me make a decision on what pizza to order. I went with a Thai chicken which was amazing!","Seriously LOVE Angelinas!! This place has always provided great customer service and even better food!! . From their burgers, to their pizza, to their calamari--delicious!!! And their portions are way more than enough! . Would definitely recommend to a friend!","Just like all the Rosati's back home in Chicago. Good pizza and full menu too. Plenty of TV's and a large bar to sit at. Outdoor patio as well for when it's cooler out.","By my standard Veronas should get at least 2 stars but im giving it 1 on the basis of it being the last resort. Little to nothing in this place is editable and serves a primary purpose of feeding meth heads, im guessing. But over the 6 times I have given in and placed an order it has been nothing short of trash in the garage.  4 bites would be an ideal circumstance, i can digest the fries, those have been good. All else, god awful. Food, from my understanding, includes that notion humans can digest it. If that is the literal understanding of food, Verona's doesnt sell any for its lacks the ability to digest, based on my experiences. I would suggest palermo pizza instead.","Fun place! We had a laser tag birthday party here and everyone (kids and adults) had a blast. . This is obvious but . . . guard your belongings carefully. Cash stolen from your wallet will put a damper on all the fun. Rooms do lock, though the room supervisor may not have a key on his/her person and will need to go find one. The locking/unlocking process seems awkward. Keypads or passcards might be a nice update for RINX to consider. . Kids said the pizza was good! Staff was friendly and helpful.","We are stayed in hotel due to a dust storm alert at night. So, we decided to give it a try!. We ordered the Alfredo chicken pizza, and chicken wings, $21 in total including $2 delivery fee. It would be better if pizza had more chicken and spinach on it. . The delivery driver is friendly. When I opened the boxes, the food is still very hot!. I want to give 5 star to the pizza! in my opinion, it is better than the pizzas at the buffet at Caesar Palace. I normally don't eat the edge of pizzas, but this time the edges were crispy, every slice is baked in perfection!","frequented this place quite regularly throughout grad school (i lived right across the street at Graduate House for 2 years) . . . i came to like this place better than Cora's, even if the pizzas might not be the freshest. they are nevertheless pretty tasty. i think the Terminator slice is definitely the best. the slices that are more meat-heavy, such as the Brando, are not as good imo. and, yes, the place could use a thorough cleaning. but it's a good bang for the buck.","Not going back. We've eaten here twice and had some lackluster experiences. The first time our food was okay but our service was slow. Thought it was just due to a busy night so we gave it another chance. . The second is what solidified our decision. First we were seated in a small section where there was a party of ~12 people, half of which were screaming children ages 7-10. It was so obnoxious we couldn't hear each other talk and we asked to be moved. Our waitress was very polite and attentive, but the food took forever. We got queso for an appetizer and it took ~20 minutes for them to bring it. Our food came by only 5 minutes later causing the predicament of \"which one do I let go cold?\". My fianc\u00e9's pizza was very undercooked and he had to send it back. It took them 15 minutes to make a new one and I had already finished eating by that time. They offered a free beer to make up for the issue. The only thing I can say was phenomenal was the giant cookie we had for dessert. It was very rich and gooey. . Like I said, not going back again. Not worth our time when we can have much better food in a much shorter amount of time.","I like a good pizza. Scratch that - I love a good pizza. It has gotten to the point where I am experimenting at home making my own. . . and getting decent success as I keep working out the kinks. It's not perfect but in the meantime, that is what good restaurants are for, am I right? Last month, following a wonderful few hours at La Mondiale de la Biere enjoying many many brews, my friends and I got the hankering for some pizza. Thinking about the options closest to us, I figured a visit to BEVO in the old port was in order. So we casually walked over ready to enjoy some good Italian cuisine. . Located just off Place Jacques Cartier in the heart of the Old Port, BEVO visually is in keeping with many of the Old Port establishments - a mix of the old brick and stone foundations of the area buildings with some more modern elements to add some glam. In this case, BEVO uses red tinted glass around the atrium, a very large chandelier and an tile entry wait which includes a glass wine cellar. The first floor has a huge bar area where the backbar is lit up in red and the front of the actual bar is just a light box. Add an area where there are 70s-style hanging bubble chairs and you have a spot that is clearly a solid happy hour zone. . On this occasion however, we were there too late for happy hour and too early for any late-night bar scene. The two dining areas are more straight forward than the bar - wooden tables and chairs, paper tablecloths with cute info-graphics about pizza making and red checkered napkins for that little old school Italian restaurant touch. On the first floor, the wood-fired pizza oven is visible for all to see and gets you excited for what is to come. . Our first starter was salsiccia e Rapini - a house made sausage with garlic rapini. The sausages were delicious although a little small for my liking. Rapini is one of those vegetables you either love or hate - personally I am a fan of its bitterness. The combination of bitter with the garlic made a nice partner to the fatty sausages. . The second starter was arancino - saffron parmesan risotto balls with meat ragu and mozzarella. The risotto ball itself had a good crust to it and that didn't come at the cost of drying out the risotto itself. It still had nice creaminess although I really didn't get any hint of saffron personally. The meat ragu draped over it had a nice meaty richness to it and paired very well to the ball itself. Like the previous starter, I just wanted more!. Because one of the friends with me doesn't eat cheese (i know, i know. . . . i've tried to show him the error of his ways) we did order one non-pizza main dish: the cavatelli bolognese - dumplings, meat ragu and fresh parsley. Excellent plate of pasta - same delicious meat ragu as before with the perfectly cooked cavatelli. A little bit of parmesan would have been nice but that was a lost battle from the start in this case. . Now we arrive to the main attraction: the pizzas. First up, I got the parma in blanco - prosciutto di parma, arugula and reggiano. This is probably my favourite pizza type when dealing with classic thin crust pizzas. The salty rich prosciutto, the pepper arugula, the sharp reggiano and a little bit of olive oil. . . a perfect balance of items on top of a pizza. However, all of that is wasted if the actual pizza isn't up to snuff. BEVO doesn't have that problem. The wood-fired oven gives a nice crispness to the bottom but allows for just enough rise to create some chewiness. A wonderful pizza. . The other pizza we ordered was the cotto e bocconcini - prosciutto cotto, portobello, tomato sauce, mozzarella and bocconcini. Same solid crust as my pizza although this one had been cooked a little more as the extra charring around the edge demonstrated. The melted bocconcini brought some more creaminess compared to just the mozzarella and the earthy portobellos added some contrast from the prosciutto. Another excellent pizza. . BEVO is a solid experience from beginning to end. Solid starters, delicious pizzas and good pasta. All the beers from Beerfest prior eliminated our desire to test the cocktail and wine lists which seemed interesting. There was also the temptation of the nutella pizza for dessert but we decided to pass. Just gives me another reason to return. If you are looking for a good pizza in the Old Port or just a place to go enjoy a drink and a quick bit, BEVO is worth your consideration. . Cheers!","So I love the concept, like the atmosphere, and like the food. (My favs are the curry chicken salad sandwich, the BBQ chicken pizza, the onion rings and the sweet potato fries)  However there are 2 things that keep me from giving Joe's 5 stars:  the prices and the huge lines. Considering they grow all their own produce, the prices could be a tad cheaper. But what bothers me more is the lines. Ever since Joe's Farm Grill has opened, there has been lines, and I am sorry, but this problem should have been solved by now. Open 2 windows on the weekends, hire more cooks, do SOMETHING, but NO food is worth waiting over an hour just to order. Long lines may be a boost to the ego, but not really good customer service. If Joe's could solve this issue, I would visit much more often, because I really do commend them for doing something unique.","Today I was sitting at home, didnt feel like cooking or pizza. So I checked trusty yelp, seen the reviews and ordered the combo kabobs ans naan bread. Hands down the best Afghan cuisine I have ever tried. I am blown away. You HAVE to try this place. . I will be eating here tomorrow as well, have to try their gyros now.","I really want to love this place, but I just can't. My friends and I have given them two chances and both times we left feeling underwhelmed. . Both experiences were after our wine making and bottling experience at Casavino Winery down the street. The first time, we knew nothing about the restaurant except that it looked warm and inviting from the outside. The ambience is lovely; it feels cozy and intimate. When you get that vibe from a restaurant, you just know you're in for a treat, right? I wish. . We had a ditzy waitress who clearly knew nothing about the menu. I asked her what the lobster ravioli was like, and she responded with \"I don't think there's actually any lobster in it. \" Really? No lobster in lobster ravioli? Choosing to play it safe, I opted for the cheese ravioli (which was quite tasty). I also thoroughly enjoyed the pizza crust bread they brought to whet our appetites. However, the service for the remainder of the evening was consistently mediocre. . We decided to give them another chance tonight since the food was decent the first time. This time, our waitress was friendly and kept a good eye on our table. I once again inquired about the lobster ravioli and she confirmed that yes, it contained lobster. I ordered it with the vodka sauce, while my boyfriend selected it with the lemon garlic butter sauce that she highly recommended. Our friends both ordered ravioli as well, albeit not lobster. . ONE HOUR LATER our food arrives. Our waitress was very apologetic about the wait and ensured our bread bowl was continually replenished, but we were quite anxious for our entrees. . . . which showed up COLD.  At least, the two lobster dishes did. Mine tasted fine when it was finally heated up, but my boyfriend and I definitely didn't care for the lemon butter garlic sauce. Once again, our waitress was very apologetic and assured us that she served us as soon as the chefs were done, but at this point, considering we're rarely in the area, we're done giving Sapori D'Italia chances. . It's a shame - there are so many rave reviews, and the little family run business has a lot of potential. . . . but they have some kinks to iron out.","Walking through Aria, we saw numerous huge pizza boxes leaving Five50. Upon further inspection, we determined that the menu looked pretty good, and that it looked like Neapolitan style pizza cooked in a pizza oven- our favourite!. We didn't make a reservation, and ended up waiting about 20 minutes before being seated. Funny, because when we were seated, we found that probably 30% of the restaurant's tables were empty. Maybe they were understaffed on this particular Saturday night?. The server we did have was extremely slow at everything from taking our order to bringing out our drinks and refilling our water, and then finally taking forever to bring our bill. . There were four of us, and we each had ceaser salads, and determined that we'd share the truffle and margherita pizzas. The salads were great, no complaints there, as was the margherita pizza. The truffle pizza was completely overwhelming, and I think it has put me off truffles for a little while!  Too much truffle!!. Ultimately, looking back on how much time we spent debating over which pizzas to choose, I think some of the choices were a little too \"out there\" and there seemed to be something on each one of them that one of our group couldn't handle. . Definitely wouldn't return to Five50, considering all of the other choices for food in Vegas. To get more stars in Vegas I have to leave feeling not only satisfied, but like I'd return for another meal.","I rarely give places five stars, I feel like it negates the idea of a five star rating, but I was tempted. I never went to the Charlotte Convention Center prior to November of 2014, so I can't speak for past reviews, but it seems to me the Convention center has been modernized, and thanks to some new ballrooms in the NASCAR plaza next door, expanded greatly. I was there for the Charlotte International Auto Show in November (don't ask why I decided to write this today) and the main exhibition hall was incredibly large. Yes, I'm sure there are bigger ones somewhere else, the transplants in this town will be the first to tell you that, but frankly, in regards to location, and not to mention close proximity to not only the central bus terminal, but also the Lynx Blue Line (which runs through the convention center!) the CCC is probably one of the best urban convention centers out there. My only complaint is the lack of an attached hotel. I do want to make clear though, there are literally dozens or accommodations nearby, but nothing on site or accessible via sky-walk. If you insist on not utilizing the light rail or bus, there is parking available nearby. Especially on weekends where you may be lucky and locate a street spot for free. During the week I'd recommend keeping it in a deck and leaving it there until you're done. I elected not to eat at the convention center, but locating decent food, especially during the day shouldn't be too hard, During the workday many of the restaurants in the Overstreet Mall are open, not to mention some places like FUEL pizza just across the way, and more expensive options if you're having an occasion, I'm sure Yelp could help you find what you need in that respect. Anyway, I'm rambling now, overall, great convention center, as with anything, there's always room to do better, and I'm sure depending on your reason to be there, that may affect your mood about the whole thing as well.","I am very happy to see Giordanos finall6 come to the valley and looking forward to a location in Scottsdale in the next 2 yrs. . . I  loved the Pizza, my friends that I took for their 1st experience loved it. . . it was busy but didn't mind the wait. . . we had app platter which was great. . . . pizza awesome. . . I  do recommend if you have a 20 min wait for example place an order when you get there ofv you know what you want to cut on wait time after you are seated. . . . . Good service. Very friendly. . . . obviously being a new place expect growing pains. . . . they do deliver. . I  do hooe they will get another pizza oven to help with the flow","Awesome atmosphere, great service, great prices, and most important of all GREAT FOOD. It can be crowded during peak hours but certainly worth the wait. The Wood Fired pizzas are highly recommended.","Ordered delivery, 2 hours later the delivery lady called my phone to meet her at the front desk. While I was sitting there waiting, I saw her pass me by and basically disappear somewhere. 15 minutes later she called me again saying she was at the baggage claim. When I told her I had been waiting at the front desk all along, she told me there was only one person there. Hell yeah, and that person was me. Like, what was wrong with her? Anyway, I finally got my pizza, and it was stone cold, not a thin crust that I ordered, and the toppings were only in the center. Never. Again.","So here is my second review of Mercatto. I was disappointed the first time and sad to say, was disappointed yet again. . After promises from friends that it has changed, it is exactly the same. . I brought a visiting physician friend from Calgary. We just missed the lunch rush which was great as we had a lot of catching up to do. I ordered one of 5 salads posted and was told by our server that it was no longer available. After asking for my second choice, that too was sold out. When asked what was available I was advised that they could make me a mismash of items that are left. What did I get? Honestly, literally a can of opened chickpeas, a few pieces of brocolli and some kidney beans. No dressing was offered, no flavouring, etc. . My friends pizza was just okay. Lacked any flavour. It was just a tomato pizza with no depth. . Mercatto, you have dupped me for the last time. Honestly, venutre 1 or 2 blocks in either direction and you can find far more better fare.","Laura was so helpful and cheerful. It's a very clean place and I am super excited to take my 20. 00 lunch of Chicago Deep dish, salad and a S'more dessert pizza and yes it was 20 bucks and there is more than enough for dinner tonight.","Good pizza and it was ready in 20 minutes, as promised. I ordered via phone, so not sure how well they take online orders. I didn't use a coupon, although I wish I had one. It cost me $23 for 2 large 1-topping pizzas. . Pizza was good, as always. This location is recommended. . Note: It's in the Target shopping center.","In the glitz and glamour of Vegas, it is refreshing to find a place like Esther's serving an honest, high quality meal at a competitive price point. Our meal consisted of the sour dough, charcuterie board, pizza of the day, 2 entree pastas, porchetta and the butterscotch budino. All told, I know we could have easily spent twice the amount on the Strip for the same meal. Service was evenly paced and the quality of the final product speaks for itself. On a side note, the staff is engaging and it is wonderful to see chef Trees at the helm as expeditor finishing plates before they hit the floor. The North end of Las Vegas is really coming into its own - if you have the chance, get out and explore!. Support the local privateers like Trees and his team at Esther's!","I love pizza. When in Vegas, you must eat here. Plus, it's at the fashion show mall so you can get some shopping done too. The crust is thin and crispy, the toppings are fresh, and the sauce is not too overwhelming. I don't eat too much at once so I skip the appetizers and go straight to the pizza. Whether you get a red or a white, they're both equally delicious, which is why we always get both. The servers are nice, and there are TV's just in case you need to watch a sporting event at the same time. This is another place we go to every time we're in Vegas. We used to go to that place in New York New York, but after trying the pizza at Grimaldi's, we haven't been there since. The balance of crust to toppings in perfect, and the crust doesn't get soggy. What a great place to eat at the mall!","It's pizza. It's kind of tough to mess that up completely.  . All Italian places are the same where the red sauce can make or break. Caesars is more on the spicy side versus sweet, so keep that in mind when going. Overall good for convenience.","Really good pizza, a little greasy but it's good. They have large pieces And have been good since they first came in this neighborhood ten years ago.","Great wings and they have the best thin crust pizza. I took one star off because the bread sticks didnt have anything on top like they forgot to put it on. Other than that great food and fast delivery time but pizza hut is becaming cheap a** they dont give u red peppers","Great tasty pizza. Our party of 5 each ordered a pizza and shared with plenty of leftovers. Pizzas took over a whole second level of our table.  . We Tried the Mac and cheese - dry and flavorless. . Enjoyed the atmosphere. Very good for talking, no loud music. Nice upbeat","This place hit the spot!  I was tired after 4 days in a row w/ just 2-3 hours of sleep, I had a 5 hour flight ahead of me, and I was hungry. Pizza it is. . . . . . Got a slice of cheese pizza, some fries, and a bottle of water (w/ a side of ranch and ketchup).  mmmmmm mmmmmm!!! that was off the hook!  the fourth star is because they're a fast food pizza joint that has fries too!  Hit the spot. . . . . I should've got a whole pizza and just brought it on the plane w/ a bag of fries. . . . . now I know for next time.","The workers are rude and have huge attitudes the pizza was over cooked and the crazy bread was dry. This isn't the 1st time I had a bad experience here. It's better to go to the one on Charleston and Decatur because this one sucks!","Don't understand why the bad reviews? We ordered xlarge cheese. I like the crust. Its buttery. Sauce is good and its super stringy cheese is totally New York. Ranch dip is thick but good. (Yes I like ranch with NY pizza and I know what your thinking)  If your looking for great pizza and super super good service you found your spot. The atmosphere here is 5 star and the pizza is great. The wings sounded good but didn't order any. The other menu items only looked ok. . but I didn't try. I really am tempted to have the pistachio custard but better not!","Just finished eating the meat lovers pizza (without Ham). Really love the marinara sauce! Very lite tasting. Cheese is on point. Delivery driver very courteous. Will order from East West Pizzeria again! Thanks","Only been here once. Had beer flights and tasted several delicious brews. Love the microbrewery atmosphere and food offerings. Shared some appetizers with my wife. I ordered a burger and my wife ordered a pizza, all of which was very tasty. A bit pricey, but well worth it as an occasional splurge over the boring, chain restaurants. Will definitely be back to try more!","Oh Donald Trump, you sure know how to make your hotels glamorous, fabulous, and classy.  . I give this place 4. 5 stars because it's still no Encore. However, I rounded it up to 5 because of great customer service. . Booking a hotel for an all girl trip to Vegas was a lot easier than I thought. Thanks to Travel Zoo's amazing deal, we booked Friday-Sunday for $99/night for a Studio Suite. It usually costs around $150/night for these bad boy suites. Keep in mind they have the annoying $20 \"convenience fees\"  each night!  Regardless, it was still a steal!  Boy, I love Vegas.   . The Hotel: . When we arrived, they only offer free valet service, no self parking. What a great way to roll into Vegas. We walked straight to the lobby and avoided walking through a parade of smokers and casino players unlike other hotels. The lobby is absolutely gorgeous with glitzy lights, gold colors, and it smelled so good there. . . like potpourri. They have a nice luxurious lounging area where people can wine and dine as well. Yes, it is non-smoking and they have no casino. I actually prefer this just because of the quick easy access to the rooms and quietness after a night out in Vegas. . The suite:  . We got the suite room which comes with a King sized bed and a pull-out queen bed couch. It came with a European style kitchen so it had a mini fridge, stove, microwave, sink, and some dishes. It was very spacious and the perfect amount of room for 5 gals. The bed was comfortable but nothing like them Encore bed/sheets ya know what I'm sayin? They give two small complimentary water bottles but each additional one is $1. . The bathroom was HUGE. It came with a big shower area, toilet area, and a few amenities. The only thing about the showers is it's slightly see-through. Hence, you can see blurry naked bodies if someone is showering or taking a poop. What a tease!  Highlights of the bathroom:  big tub/jacuzzi and a cool snazzy tv in the mirror. Never seen anything like that so kudos, Mr. Trump. We made good use of the tub, it was extremely relaxing!  My girls and I slipped into our jammies, ordered pizza delivery, and soaked our poor feet after a night of dancing in painful heels. That's how we roll after a night of debauchery. . Swimming Pool: . This is probably the only downside to the hotel. It was just a regular rectangular sized pool but it had nice lounging sofas and chairs out with waitresses serving drinks. One perk is they have a gym and spa right next to it. Free gym access for hotel residents! (That's where part of your convenience fee goes towards fyi. ) . Location:  . We made use of their free shuttle service to the Encore/Wynn and Caesar's Palace. Taxi cabs would cost around $8-12 depending on traffic as well, but split that between us girls it was definitely worth it. It's also literally right across the Fashion Mall, haaaay! Very convenient for last minute clubbing outfits or to grab a quick bite to eat. . Customer Service:  . Excellent service. I called and complained about a minor incident with my friend who had an encounter with security because her hotel key didn't work late night and they gave her a tough time since the room was under my name. So security had to come up to our room at 5am to check my id. Situation with security could've been handled better but I understand they are doing it for security reasons. However, I called them up and a nice manager named Gerald was extremely helpful and offered an upgrade to a One Bedroom Corner Premium Suite next time I book with them. That's the way to do business! . Downsides:. Only downside was you may have to wait awhile for valet and shuttle services to come around. Also, we called room service for extra blankets, pillows, towels. But they ran out of blankets! The hell? So my friends slept in the comfy bathrobe with the sheets. At least they hooked us with tons of pillows and towels. . I will definitely be back at the Trump Hotel, frolicking in a bathrobe in my upgrade corner suite next time!","On Friday night we had dinner at Tommy V's Osteria Pizzeria, across from the Biltmore Fashion Park at 32nd St. and Camelback. It's a relatively new spin-off of Tomaso's Restaurant which has been at that location for 32 years. Where Tomaso's is upscale, dressier, and heavy on the proteins, Tommy V is casual and carb-oriented. It's interesting that the prices on most of the appetizers, salads and pastas are pretty much the same at both locations. . Tommy V's is divided up into two rooms. You enter the bar area which also houses an open kitchen with wood burning pizza oven. It's light-filled and colorful. and also very loud. The second room is more sedate, and unfortunately somewhat gloomy. It's dimly lit, and the faux brick, dark wood, and taupe painted walls don't help. There are some windows cut into the front and back walls, framed with curtains, which look into the bar area, and a third back room. Very weird. However, the gloom was dispelled when our cheerful waitress brought us a basket of crusty bread and some fabulous pesto butter, redolent of garlic. She informed us that happy hour was on (from 5 - 7), and we could get most of the wines on the menu for $5 a glass or $20 a bottle. We decided to share a glass of red Primitivo 'Layer Cake' (I don't know why it was called that, but you knew that I wouldn't be able to resist ordering it). It turned out to be delicious, rich and deeply fruity. Because we had arrived quite early - I didn't know how busy the restaurant would be and reservations are only taken for tables of 6 - we ordered a roasted beet and goat cheese salad ($8) while we awaited our friends Walt and Maria. While it was quite good, it didn't live up to the one we had at The Parlor since the beets weren't multi-colored and the dressing didn't have as much zing. However, there was lots of cheese and toasted pistachios. . When Walt and Maria arrived, our bread basket and carafe of butter was swiftly refilled (the bussing was top notch). I suggested that they try the Primitivo, and they ordered the Romaine Wedge salad ($7) with bacon and gorgonzola. It was beautifully presented, with a pile of whole romaine leaves holding the accompaniments and dressing. All the salad ingredients were quite fresh. I ordered an Eggplant Torta ($15), described as \"Baked Multi-layer of Eggplant, Cheese Fondue, Pasta\". Ken opted for V's Kick Ass Burger 9 oz ($12) - \"Handcrafted with Short Rib, Brisket &amp; Kobe Beef, Caramelized Onions, Heirloom Tomatoes, Bacon, Blue Cheese, Arugula, Truffle Aioli &amp; Parmesan Herb Roasted Potatoes\". The combination of meats made this too interesting to pass up. Walt and Maria decided to share a pizza. These are \"personal size\", 10 - 12 inches, and range in price from $10 for a Margherita with mozzarella and tomatoes to . $16 for a Proscuitto and Fig pie with gorgonzola and arugula. Unfortunately I don't remember what kind they had, but they said they enjoyed it, and it was actually big enough that 2 pieces were taken home. The burger was great. It was big and juicy with a fascinating texture because of the short ribs and brisket - it's now my favorite Phoenix burger, and the price is comparable to the other good ones served elsewhere. Ken loved the roasted potatoes, and while they were flavorful, I prefer nice crunchy fries. My eggplant torta was a pleasant, non-confrontational variant of eggplant parmesan. But having taken a Zantac, I was looking forward to confrontation - a spicy sauce and loads of gooey cheese. This was disappointing, but edible. It was also a fairy small portion. . There were no surprises on the dessert menu - tiramisu, cannoli, etc. We ordered a tartufo for the table. When it arrived, nicely sliced, there was none of the zablione promised on the menu. I asked the waitress about that and she tried to tell me that it had been \"mixed in\". When I gave her a skeptical, unhappy look she brought over the owner/manager (I'm not sure which he was), and he apologized, saying that there's been a dispute with the distributor over that item. We weren't charged for it, which was very nice, since we did eat it all. . The parking in front of the restaurant is limited, but Walt said to tell you that immediately to the east of the strip mall containing the restaurant there's a large parking lot, not particularly visible to the street. All in all I'd say this was a good dining experience and we'll go back to try some of the interesting pastas like braised short rib gnocchi ($20) or butternut squash ravioli with amaretto cookies, toasted almonds and parmigiano sage sauce ($15). And especially to have another burger!!","Not sure why others have had such bad experiences here. This is one of the best pizzas in Arizona. It costs more than the national chains but it is so much better. I love their deep dish sausage pizza. Amazing!","We have enjoyed our dining experiences here many times and have always felt so pleased with the service provided and quality of food. Everything here is homemade and made with love and it shows from the wood fired pizzas which are the best I have ever had to the homemade pasta, cheeses and desserts. The Tiramisu is wonderful. They really know how to take care of their guests and I look forward to our future visits!!","One of the best meatball subs I ever experienced. Creative and top quality pizza  choices. The service has always been spot on and the decor is modern and comfortable. Crazy good happy \"hour\". I find myself stopping here a lot and have always left happier than I walked in. Well done Aria.","Holy heck this place is a hidden gem! Super fresh, delicious, and great atmosphere! I recommend the truffle pizza and the caprese. Haven't had a chance to try the philly cheese steaks but that's next on my list! The quality of the food is very high and it's priced great.","This is not my first time eating Giordanos pizza. I love this pizza and crave it all the time. Every time I visit Chicago I always make sure to stop at a Giordanos and eat there. Well they finally opened up a location on 83rd and Bell. We first started off with the calamari. It was good but there was 2 calamari balls. What I mean is when they deep-fried them they a lot of them stuck together. Still tasted good but was frustrating to eat them properly. We also ordered a pepperoni pizza deep dish. Let's just say it's nothing like the one in Chicago. Everything about the pizza was wrong. When the server brought us the pizza and cut us slices the cheese melted completely off the pizza and It wasn't even in the shape of a slice after it was put on a plate. Looked like a round circle of cheese with crust on the end. Cheese tasted different , there were was not enough pepperoni for you to even call it a pepperoni pizza. Also the crust underneath the pizza was missing. . . . in the center of the pizza. The center only had cheese and then as you move towards the outer crust it builds up. So at the beginning of eating this pizza I was just eating pure cheese. I'm not complaining about any wait time which was one hour. Giordanos always takes about 40 minutes to an hour. This whole complaint is 100% the pizza. I was very excited about them opening up in Phoenix but after this experience I can say that I will NOT be attending this location again. . . I don't recommend this location of Giordanos. If you want the good stuff go to Chicago","Ordered through eat24, delivery took about an hour,  however pizza was hot when received, the mozzarella sticks on the other were not. The pizza was great, nice abound of cheese, not too thick of a crust. The ranch was great!!! Got a canoli to try and it was good, not great. . The marinara sauce has a bit of spice that I was not expecting so it was a nice surprise. I would order from them again, but maybe pick up next time","The reception is friendly, the service is very good. The meal has really Italian taste, the pizzas are unique, no comparing to  other pizzerias, much more better, the best one. Disadvantage: open space, a bit noisy, no music. At least, you're not able to listen to music. Conclusion: the menu is really great, the ambient should be improved. Anyway, we'll be back!","I was in this strip mall, saw pizza, and decided to give it a try. I had a pepperoni pizza. It was a very good pizza that I have had in a while. The cheese was soft and moist, not dry or rubbery. Crust was the star, it had just the right amount of chew without being dry or tough.","We were headed to Hash House A Go Go only to find out they closed that location so we ate here instead. The food was delicious but way too overpriced for a deli sandwich. I got the Italian sub that had quite a bit of meat. My son got a slice of pizza that was probably the best priced thing on the menu. The slice was huge and only 5. 99. Despite the food being delicious I  would probably only eat here again if it was the only thing open.","I needed a quick lunch and CiCis hit the spot. It was fast, ready and affordable. They had a lunch special for $3. 99. Quite a deal! I enjoyed the salad bar. The pizza was ok. It was warm and had decent toppings. Nothing to write home about by just what I needed for a 10 min lunch on the way to an appointment. The staff at this location is really great!","Curiousity strikes the minute you walk in. You are greeted by what looks like a guitar store front as you are led into another doorway and hall that leads to the back bar area and then dining room. . We just visited to see what the place was like and to try a couple of the specialty cocktails we had heard about. We had tried a few that were suggested by the bartender. Unfortunately, we didn't love the cocktails as much as we had hoped. There wasn't much pizzazz about them and a couple of them were actually pretty hard to swallow. . Emerald gimlet had an extremely overpowering taste of basil. So if you like basil this might be good for you, however I felt as if I was eating straight basil leaves. Disappointing. . I do however want to try dining here, the menu did look quite appealing and different. One day. . . .","The mozzarella bar is perfection and the atmosphere is good. Service is great! The only thing is that our pizza tasted a little. . . Funky. . . Like something slipped in the crust. Overall, great place and I will definitely be coming back in the future.","Great food, great service, great time!  Food was unbelievable, especially mushroom pizza and gnocchi. Chrissy was our waitress - helpful, attentive and on top of everything!  Dinner and Drinks were well made with terrific ambience. Worth it - Will be back for more!","It was ok until we refilled our drinks and the stupid bitch threw our pizza away. It was the kids pizza. She could see we were not finish.","One of The Best pizzas we've had in AZ.  We r from E Coast &amp; love r pizza. We r frequent customers. . . mostly pizza","I finally gave Caliente another try after several bad experiences, and I'm happy I did. Delivery was prompt, service was quick, and the pizza was great. I had sworn off this place, but after a few great orders, it's back to my go-to.","What is up with these highly rated bloomfield pizza joints? I ordered an XL regular (not white, not sicilian) pizza with pepperoni and green peppers. Delivery was fine, but the pizza was terrible!!  The green peppers had a super off-taste that permeated the whole pizza. Everyone agreed that it was very sub-par. . Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing off the menu, but after that experience I don't think I'm willing to give it a second shot.","Some other reviewers here have said that this buffet is probably the best Asian one in Pittsburgh. I am not sure about that. This buffet is OK, but I might not return. The price is not bad for all-you-can-eat (especially crab legs). The food selection is typical: lo mein, rice, chicken with broccoli, general tso, sushi, soups, American (pizza, chicken nuggets), salad, fruit, desserts, ice cream, etc. Some of the male customers pushed female customers out of the way to get to the food, and my big husband had to intervene.","The restaurant manager Scott went above and beyond for us. Highly recommend the pizza dessert with Nutella and ice cream, the flower decor is impeccable, vibrant colors throughput the restaurant, beautiful ambiance!","The pizza looked as if it had been sitting for a while. We got two slices from the bar, the tomato sauce was cold and the dough had a good taste but was really tough and chewy I would recommend going to Secret pizza at the Cosmopolitan or somewhere else that doesn't charge $6 a slice for old pizza","So had a brief love affair with this place that came to a screeching halt when on the same visit the cook snagged a piece of my pizza, prior to boxing and handing it to me, and the two dozen wings never saw a drop of buffalo sauce. This wasn't ineptitude, it was a request for me to take my business elsewhere, and I have. So if a Caucasian 30 something male with that 4 day beard thing going on either takes or cooks or presents your order check it BEFORE you leave, everyone else there is A-OK.","This place is amazing. . We ordered way too much. Bread, charcuterie, spaghetti, polenta, cavatelli, and pizza. Not one thing was terrible!. Our server was a little odd and didn't know the menu at all but we managed to work around that. . BUT the food speaks for itself. Can't wait to get back here.","Getting caught up on my Yelp reviews tonight. Not sure how this one has taken me so long to get to, since I've been a fan since the week after the opened. That's because this place is amazing. It's a personal pizza that is truly personalized. You go down a \"Subway-style\" row of toppings and literally create the pizza of your dreams. . in case you're not dreaming big enough, I'll give you two tips to make the best Custom Built: First, get the spicy sauce . . . if it's too spicy for you, get half spicy (they'll mix it with the regular sauce). Second, have Mo put an egg on top. It's not on the menu, but as long as they have some in the fridge they'll put it on top and your life will never be the same again. . Also, don't say I didn't warn you that the s'more pizza is dangerously addictive.","I gotta give it 5 stars. Found this small shop by accident. The  shop is very small with seating for maybe 8-10 people. The owner is very nice and makes his own \"meat spread\" and his own Soujouk (sausage) in the shop. I had the Armenian pizza which has tomato sauce, cheese, their meat spread, onions and their Soujouk. Very very good. I also had a San Pellegrino limonata drink which is about as tart as all get out but worked with the Pizza. I have got to come back and try some of their other specialties the next time I am in town. Make the effort and find this shop. You will not be disappointed. Parking is tough though.","This place makes me crazy. I would really want to love it here. Close to my house, good beer on draft, good salads, good pizza. (Too small for my boyfriend; he's not coming back. ) I NEVER get greeted quickly here. I sat at the bar for 10? minutes at lunchtime. and at least 3 people walked by. They must have seen me; it's like they avoid making eye contact and won't offer a glass of water until they have time. This has happened every time I've been there. Once we were seated the service improved, but I had to go from irate to barely satisfied.","Amazing Amazing Amazing. The food here is absolutely incredible and the service is outstanding. Lunchtime setup is a deli with both hot and cold sandwiches and soups and salads. Last week I ate a different soup here for lunch everyday. Dinner time switches it up to a real fancy/casual restaurant style setting with fondues, pizza, pastas, to-die-for entrees, unique appetizers, and more. Everybody there seems to love the work and it definitely shows to costumers in quality of service and food. . Had a talk with the owners the other day and this place has been here for 30 years, family owned the whole time. Heavily influenced by Swiss culture and European tradition this place has quite a unique feel. . Bottom line: For great food with a bit of a Swiss touch, both lunch or dinner, this is the place to be.","MY WHOLE FAMILY GOT FOOD POISONING!! We came here this past Sunday 4/15/18 around 3-4pm in the afternoon. We ordered a pizza for our family to split. This is the first we had eaten all day after spending the whole day at Goldfield. Hours later all of my kids starting throwing up. It lasted all night. We had to keep them home from school it was so bad. This is our first time coming here as we have heard good things- this is going to be our last time for sure. I'm disappointed in the quality and it saddens me that my kids had to eat this poor quality food. Disgusting. I will be making a call to the health inspector to check this place out.","Honesty alert - I've never made it past ice cream. I want to I do - serious pizza lover right here - but when a small sugar cone is $3, massive and so creamy and rich - you never get inside. . Pumpkin is my favorite but only seasonal so the cookie dough becomes my go to. . . and if you have the room they literally serve the worlds best banana split - they even ask how you want it - traditional or sub out flavors for the ice cream - do the traditional and thank me (just after you thank them).","We've been eating at Manhattan Pizza for years &amp; love it!  We'd never make it home with that aroma in the car, so we always eat in-house when it's hot out of their oven. They make a decent antipasto too. Grandkids  eat wings &amp; chicken fingers in addition to a pizza. They say it's better than mine &amp; I'm a pretty good Italian chef!  That's ok. No clean up for me!!","This review is mainly about service, my wife and I stopped here after wrapping up at the dog park for dinner, Now we both have different tastes so we always split the pizza with different toppings. We were going to order a 3 topping pizza with half salami, onion and green pepper and the other half pepperoni, olive and mushroom. The person working told us it would be $1. 50 for each additional topping which I was quite puzzled since we were only getting a 3 topping pizza then he explained that if we wanted different toppings on the other half it would be $1. 50 each or $4. 50. At this point we walked since I have never had a pizza place charge extra for splitting the pizza.","Great gem of a place located close by to Viet Kitchen and Cave Creek Costco. They always send us coupons in the mail for a free pound of wings with purchase of an entree. They have a Tuesday deal where pizzas are around $10. We've tried the following:. - Stuffed Mushrooms: decent, a nice flavor. - Pizza: crust is deliciously garlic-y, and it has a brick-oven taste to it, goes more towards the thin side in terms of thickness. - Wings: decent","Finally got back to try the pizza after not having any pizza for months. . . Ohmygah, I was like a starved wolf. A huge XYZ pie was just the ticket! . For $14 bucks you get a pie x3 larger than your face. It's thin (thank god) with a chewy crust and lots of melty cheese. They serve it up pipping hot with grated parmesan cheese and crusted red pepper flakes. It was delicious and everything I wanted in a slice. Even better, since there was only two of us we had leftovers and it was still good heated up the next day!. The bartender from Boston who served us was also really nice. We ordered two side salads with our pie and he forgot. Once he remembered we were pretty much stuffed, so he boxed them up togo and took them both off our bill. . . Double-bonus? Even though it was after brunch I could still order a mimosa with fresh OJ. Free parking, great beer list, awesome brunch, cheap, huge pizzas--get on it.","The pizza was great, and on its own would be deserving of 5 stars. The sides however were disappointing. They also messed up our order and included an incredibly burned garlic knot. When my boyfriend went down to pick up the sides they had forgotten, they gave us extra which was nice. I would definitely have their pizza again but would skip their sides.","Great pizzas! Try the veggie or buffalo chicken pizza.","I made a point to go to Pop Up Pizza last weekend because I have noticed little articles and shout outs about the place over the past few months. Get the Dayia cheese out because I'm really excited to try the pizza!  . We ordered 2 pizzas to go. Bf was a little shocked by the price but I say whatev, we took away two 18\" pizzas to enjoy for the rest of the weekend. I ordered a vegan cheese pizza with carmelized onions and olives. It was great. The crust was thin but the edge was thick and soft-chewy. There was plenty of cheese and when you use a pizza oven the Dayia actually melts like cheese should rather then turn rubbery. I would have preferred more onions but that's just me. I think the olives were kalamata instead of canned black ones so I will skip those next time.  . Bf ordered his with onions, jalapenos and mushrooms. He had the same positive comments about his crust and taste so I see more pieces of Pop Up Pizza being consumed in our future.  . A little bit more sauce would have been appreciated but I will defer to their pizza engineer expertise when it comes to sauce-crust-topping-ratios.  . Besides offering vegan cheese for me the other best part about this place is that the casino bar has $1 beer!  That's all I have to say about that.","Yummmm!  My husband and I shared a Caesar salad and a BBQ chicken pizza (medium size but it was HUGE!) and everything was delicious!  Definitely worth a try!","Not the cleanest pizza hut but my food was hot and on time.","Just all right.  2 slices of paper thin cheese pizza and a drink for $6. 50. I've had better. Napoli Pizza, for one, seems to carry a better value for the money.","Went for a quick express lunch. Waited for awhile for a table even though plenty of them were empty. We were told they had to clean one for us. Once seated, we ordered a slice of pizza each. Also ordered some chicken parm to go for a family member at home. Told the waitress to bring the pizza but take their time cooking the chicken since it was to go. A half an hour later, no pizza was produced. There were many empty booths in our section and only one table was being served salad, and then some entree they ordered. I guess our order was not \"priority\". Why advertise that if you want a quick lunch, to order from that section of the menu, if you are going to not rush the thin crust cardboard pizza crust with bare minimum sauce and cheese? It was the worst excuse for a slice of pizza I ever had. Epic fail Oreganos!","Very limited parking, there's probably 2 parking spot in front of the restaurant. The service was great, I tried the famous pizza, however was let down because the pizza resembled too much of pizza huts deep dish pizza that was overly expensive. Would not return.","Great customer service. They made an error on my pizza order so they re-made a new pizza the way I wanted it. The wife's owner didn't charge me for the pizza plus they gave me a slice of cheese cake. Wings were great! This was my first time at this business and I will be back. I ended up at this location after trying 3 other pizza places around my residents and reviewing Yelp. This one is a winner. They have free delivery if you live within 5 miles. . It was actually nice to get great customer service in Vegas for a change. They even followed up and called me to see how my dinner went.","been there twice over priced, bad service, had veal once, never again and pizza the next time cuz it's just hard to screw up pizza.  won't be back","I will never know how this pizza tastes. I went 10 minutes too early before they opened. And even though the worker had 5 pizzas sitting out on the display counter cut and ready to be sold, he told me come back in 20 minutes. There was also a lady waiting. So, he lost out on $30 minimum of profit because he wouldn't sell the pizza that was ready - BTW, if his 20 minute wait was correct, that means he would be open 10 minutes late according to the shop hours. Thank goodness they have other food choices at the hotel so I ate in the food court and gave them my money. I mean I could of ordered Pizza Hut and it would of got there faster than his 20 minute wait rule but the food court was awesome.","Great chewiness for a neapolitan styled  pizza. . The tiramisu is a little small but it compensated with flavour.","Le BEVO Bar Pizzeria, un grand restau italien sur 2 \u00e9tages situ\u00e9 en plein coeur du Vieux-Montreal, quartier toujours bien vivant quand le beau temps montre le bout de son nez. Le BEVO dispose \u00e9galement d'une grande terrasse, et quand on est arriv\u00e9 c'\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 bond\u00e9, on a attendu environs une bonne vingtaine de minutes pour avoir une table. En attendant nous avons pris un verre \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur, j'ai pris un Amareto Sour: tr\u00e8s bon. Le d\u00e9cor est tr\u00e8s sympa, ambiance assez lounge, d'ailleurs, ils ont 3 immenses boules accroch\u00e9es au plafond dans lesquelles on peut s'asseoir, et n'ayant pas de place au bar, on s'y est donc install\u00e9. C'\u00e9tait tr\u00e8s confortable, on se balan\u00e7ait un peu, on aurait bien mang\u00e9 notre pizza l\u00e0 tiens! . Ensuite une table se lib\u00e8re et il est temps pour nous de prendre place pour commander. On a pris la COTTO E BOCCONCINI et la BOSCO IN BIANCO (accompagn\u00e9e de truffes noires). \u00c0 peine 10 minutes plus tard, nous voil\u00e0 servi. On commence avec la BOSCO, on a \u00e9videmment h\u00e2te de go\u00fbter les fameuses truffes! Et l\u00e0 le HIC! On commence \u00e0 manger et on ne go\u00fbte absolument rien, alors on commence \u00e0 les chercher sur la pizza, \u00e0 go\u00fbter les diff\u00e9rents champignons s'y trouvant et aucune truffe, alors que c'est un aliment qui a une saveur particuli\u00e8re et relativement forte. . On appelle donc la serveuse pour lui demander mais o\u00f9 sont les truffes!? Et elle-m\u00eame dit ne pas les voir! Elle a donc directement ramener la pizza en cuisine et nous en a amen\u00e9 une nouvelle et l\u00e0, mais quelle diff\u00e9rence, rien qu'\u00e0 l'odeur, \u00e0 la vue  et la premi\u00e8re bouch\u00e9, les truffes y \u00e9taient cette fois! Alors, oublie de la part du cuistot en plein coup de feu ou attrape-nigaud?! Telle est la question! Car les gens qui ne s'y connaissent pas un minimum, pourraient tr\u00e8s bien se faire avoir, alors faites tout de m\u00eame attention. . Si cela n'avait pas eu lieu, c'\u00e9tait un 5 \u00e9toiles imm\u00e9diat, car les 2 pizzas \u00e9taient d\u00e9licieuses, avec leurs p\u00e2tes fines, on s'est r\u00e9gal\u00e9!","I love NYPD, the pizza is always awesome they have the best honey BBQ chicken wings every (they but BWW to shame). Service is always great here as well and the location is great because it is in the NW valley with good parking. They also deliver and I just found out yesterday that they have great lunch specials with great prices, you can get a slice of peperoni for $2. 25, that is insane!","Pizza by Robert pizza may be a little bit more expensive than other pizzas, but it is worth every penny! They have terrific sauce and their ingredients are great tasting as well. They are my go to place when I want to good pizza.","This is a great local pizza shop in Waxhaw that my wife and I love. The owners are very friendly and the pizza is amazing! Fox's has also catered some businesses events as well and everyone was highly satisfied with the food.","We were a party of 45. Service was exceptional. Antipasto platter was huge. Had a few different pizzas and all were great. Rigatoni with bolognese sauce was awesome!!! This is one of the best hidden gems in the TO food scene!","Be prepared to spend a lengthy amount of time WAITING for your food here!. I've been here twice and I had to wait a while both times. First time it was 20 minutes. Second time it was 50 minutes!. First time:. I was grabbing food from L &amp;L next door and my wife wanted pizza. So she goes in and orders two slices of white pizza and the zappoles fried donut powdered sugar things. . We waited over 20 minutes for her order. There is no place to wait for your order in the front. It is like trying to smash 20 people into a refrigerator box. The owners really need to rethink the shelves full of groceries lining the front counter. There is NO ROOM. Especially when it is crowded. . The white pizza was good, the zeppoleswere AMAZING!  A whole brown bag full for under $5. Not bad. . Second time:. We ordered a white pizza and a meatball pizza TO GO.  They said it would be ready in 20 minutes. . Well, I arrived 20 minutes later and waited another 50 minutes for my pizza to be made. Apparently the guy making the pizza mistook it for a meatball sandwich and didn't make it until 30 minutes in. While my white pizza stood in a box on top the oven for 30 minutes to cool down. No real apology from the guy at the register either after they realized. . When I finally got my pizza and left, the meatball pizza was UNDERCOOKED / Doughy and the white pizza was COLD.  Big FAIL!. Imagine having to stand in a long, thin corridor with other people waiting for their orders like me and others trying to order and make it to the back of the dining room. GET RID OF THOSE GROCERY SHELVES PLEASE!  There needs to be more room, it's almost like a fire hazard. People were tripping over each other and myself and my very patient son. . My impression of Rocco's was that that it was a stand-only-waiting-room-of-semi-organized-chaos-in-crowded-hell. . I'd rather have Dominoes, Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Costco Pizza, Round Table Pizza, Saborros Pizza or even Mark Riches Pizza. At least they have their shtuff together and you get what you order in a timely manner.","I have been having pizza delivered for the past 3 years. Last night's offering arrived 15 minutes late, the time before was half hour and when I rang they had forgotten us!. Anyway, last night's Spinnotta arrived cold and dry. . If this was the first time I was ordering from them, I wouldn't do it again, but it used to be so very good that I may give it another chance.","This place has become my weekday lunch spot 2 to 3 times a week. Thanks so much YELP for finding me a gem of a local spot. . Decor is nice and modern and the place is freaking spotless! . The staff is warm and welcoming and attentive to your needs.  7 to 10$ for a pita, drink and a bag of chips pretty inexpensive for what you get. Ingredients are fresh and have not had a bad pita yet. Even the \"pizzas\" are delicious. . For 1st timers this place can be hard to find as it is buried in an office center. . Check out this local gem!","I dropped by here yesterday for the first time and have to say WOW it was amazing. . we ordered a few rice balls as well as a chicken parmigiana sandwich. It was all incredible!  I saw one of the pizzas while I was there and definitely plan on ordering one next time around. Portions are huge and prices are very reasonable. . The customer service was amazing and friendly. I was told by the owner that they just opened a few weeks ago, the interior is very nice as well. (if anyone remembers this use to be Naz's falafel, which wasn't very good, so this place is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood!)   I will definitely be coming here again, especially since I live in the area. . If you're in the mood for some quick,  tasty  italian (and some greek!) food, which is very reasonably priced then this is the place to go!. I cannot wait to try out the rest of Corrado's menu!","Great local pizza place. Had Sals pizza special. Generous portions of ingredients. Relaxing ambiance . Delish!","Love their sweet chili wings fried hard. . tried the honey bbq but wasnt impressed. Great pizza and good cheesecake. I definitely recommend trying. Wait times are around 20 minutes so would definitely call ahead! The only negative is they don't deliver!","Fantastic, perfectly cooked pizza. The pizza creations are creative and the ingredients high quality, fresh, and flavorful. . Table service was attentive, friendly and prompt. My next trip to Vegas I am making sure I stop by again. . They also have counter pick up service with pizza by the slice. They have a good variety of their top pizza creations by the slice which is great. . Convenient location in the Aria casino.","Very delicious pizza, nice atmosphere. Definitely should try pizza florentine.","Food was delicious, service was friendly, great little pizza place. Will happily return next time we are in town visiting! . Really recommend the cheesy passion bread and the white pizza!","Let me start by saying I don't like pizza anymore. Most pizza is dry, dull and boring. However the other day we had Rino D's Pizza at a staff meeting. They have a pizza with chicken and white sauce that is incredibly good. Its called Chicken Cordon Bleu. I probably can't spell it but I can eat it. It was the best pizza I have had in years. Since it was a staff meeting, they had several varieties. The others were good as well. They had plenty of sauce and the flavor of the sauce was genuine.  . Try the Chicken Cordon Bleu Pizza just once and you will be hooked.","I've been to several Giordano's over the last decade or so in Chicago, Minnesota, Indianapolis and now Peoria.  . The experience here was both in line with other locations and what you would expect at a new location with new staff. The service was probably closer to 2-3 stars, but I think they'll improve as their experience grows. The pizza was fantastic and just as good as any other Giordano's location I've visited. . The host did a very good job of managing the crowd and setting reasonable expectations. They also did not forget to remind us to pre-order the pizza so it would be done soon after we were seated. No complaints.","I am blown away by the Yelp reviews for this place. I kind of feel bad leaving a review this bad but holy hell the pizza was horrible. The sauce makes tomato paste look thin. The crust is like chewing on rubber bands. The worst of it all was the cheese. How the hell are all of the previous reviews okay with the cheese? It's the most tasteless mozzarella cheese I've ever had. It has literally no flavor. I really wanted to like it, the price with their coupon was right, staff courteous and delivery fast but this place is an absolute no.","Rosa rosa rosa. I actually think I met Rosa when I stopped yesterday to pick up a large thin crust pizza on my way home from work. It honestly wasn't that good, the crust tasted processed and it could have been bigger . There just wasn't much special about it . But let me say this when I looked into your eyes Rosa I saw something. . . . there is great pizza inside you Rosa I know it and you know it. Now it's time you let that pizza come out your business depends on it","I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!  I ALWAYS sit at the bar because the service is both fun, quick and an experience in itself!!  Truly. . . food is delicious, drinks are perfect and the staff is amazing!!  (side note but certainly worth stating:  One of the only bars that serve \"fresh squeezed\" greyhounds!!  Literally FRESH. . . they juice it when you order!!)   If you're trying to eat healthier, we love the side of chicken and brussel sprouts. . . So good, you might not miss the pizza!!  Serving sizes are ample, price is reasonable. . . I can't say enough great things!!  * Special shout out to Kinzer, his smile alone will make your day!!   Jeska, Cassie and TJ. . . . You guys are absolutely the best!!","Whoa! This is the Italian street food joint that has been missing in the Pittsburgh food scene. Had the Margherita DOC and the quality of ingredients was impressive for a $12 pizza. Can't wait to try their other combinations. . . love that they have a patate (potato) pizza! Their fried arrancini are as good or better than the more expensive options around the city, and they have a wider variety of these arrancini/suppl\u00ec/panzerotti than anyplace I've been outside of Italy.","Romanello's, I love you.  . When I moved to Huntersville 16 years ago it looked completely different than it does today. There was no Target, no Cook Out (!) and nobody had even dreamed of Birkdale (well, maybe. I don't know how long it takes to plan something like that). But Romanello's has always been there. Before there was a Pizza Hut or a Domino's in the area to order from we ordered from there. And even after they came, we continued to order from there.  . The pizza and calzones are great, but don't sleep on the subs and my favorite, the cheeseburger!  It's not the best cheeseburger I've EVER had, but it's amazing for something you can have delivered to your house.  . If you live in Huntersville and haven't eaten here yet, you're doing it wrong!","Apathetic young staff, decent pizza. Host was about 22 years old. Never smiled. Could care less that we had arrived to spend our cash. Server-same thing: explained nothing regarding the menu. Our experience was that everyone was on auto pilot and bored/bothered. If you want to be treated special it's not here. On a positive note, the pizza by the slice was good.","I'm not a big fan of Guys Pizza, but I'm a pizza junkie and occasional I need a  fix. The reasons for the  3 stars. . . The first star is  because it's better than gas station pizza (some of my friends might disagree). The second star is for having  pizza by the slice ALL day long. The last star is because they are usually open until  2:00am. When I do order from here,  I usually a meatball and/or pepperoni pizza. It's probably their best toppings.","Well we came here for dinner and the pizza made me feel uneasy my sister got a smoothie that made her sick and my grandmother was light headed the only reason they didn't get 1 star it for the samples. The shopping is the main part and that was your average giant eagle or Walmart.","We order from there at least once a week. Food is very good, my daughter likes their gyros. We normally get their hoagie special or pizza.","Great pizza and wings and super friendly service. Best pizza value in the West Valley!!!!","I was on Fremont Street and was pretty hungry. I love pizza so when I saw that this was near, I had to try it. I'm glad I did. The pizza was GOOD!  Definitely recommend this place!","Joes Farm Grill has never disappointed whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner everything is great! Food and service are always above and beyond. BBQ chicken pizza or the BBQ sampler plate are my favorites but you can't go wrong with anything.","5 stars for the chicken wings. half price off every tuesday. their wings are huge compared to the likes of dominoes pizza or pizza pizza. $11 will get you 15pcs but only on tuesdays.","The pizza oven is heated to a toasty 900 degrees Fahrenheit so that a fresh-made pizza only takes 90 seconds to come out perfect. I could see the pizza chefs watching over our pizzas, like expectant pizza fathers, guiding and turning the tasty circles until they were ready to complete their journey to our table. . You can imagine what happened to them once they got there. . Yum. . The service was friendly and the restaurant is inviting. Awesome Neapolitan pizza baked in 90 seconds?!?! Life. Is. Good.","I had the chicken &amp; waffles which were just perfect. The seasoning in the chicken breading was so good and went perfectly with everything. . The $5 beer and a pizza slice happy hour deal is great.","If you are hungry after a long night in Vegas this is the place to go and get a slice. Good new York style pizza big slice lots of cheese and really good sauce, if you are around  the aria make sure to stop by and get a slice. . . or three!!","We went for dinner and where so happy they had an outside patio, which is where we ate. We ordered clams w/linginie and my husband had chicken marsala. They were both fantastic. The pasta is homemade and wonderful. I got a side of vodka marinara sauce, which I could drink right from the bowl it was so great! We got pizza crust to eat before and during the meal. The crust is awesome and you get that great wood burning pizza crunch and flavor. . We are so happy we found this place. We will be back for many years to come!","Poros is out of place in Market Square, surrounded by a sea of restaurants offering nachos, fries, wings, and cheap beer. Poros is a lone island of fine food, with prices to match. Virtually all of its negative reviews mention high prices and/or small portions for the cost. The negative reviews come from diners looking for cheap eats but mistakenly wandering onto the island of Poros. It's a case of misplaced expectations, hurtful to both the restaurant and the customer. . We have been happy with Poros, having enjoyed several dinners there. We chose to 'sacrifice' last night, a Friday in lent, by treating ourselves to a seafood dinner. As always, it was excellent, consisting of the humus starter, crab cakes, halibut, and the requisite California Chardonnay. Service started out fine but slowed down considerably as the meal progressed. The dining room is modern and very attractive, and the menu and wine list well-conceived. It can be a little too loud when full, but overall Poros is a good, not great, fine dining restaurant. If you're in Market Square looking for fries, pizza, or cheap drinks, walk on past Poros, it will just disappoint.","VERY VERY GOOD PIZZA!  OMG, tried this place the other day and was impressed with how fresh the ingredients were. Pepperoni tasted amazing. Went back the next week and tried the Pepperoni and Sausage. . . again amazing. Glad to have found this little gem right in my backyard from work!  Met the owner Adrian and he take personal pride in each pizza he makes. Highly recommend!","The cocktails are very good and probably what Lucille is best known for. If you are going just for drinks heading downstairs to the vault is nice and often a little quieter. The pizza is pretty good but a number of them are a bit unusual. Maybe I'm a pizza traditionalist, but I'm not convinced BBQ sauce belongs on pizza. Some of the more typical combos like the Tomato Pie are quite good.","Buying a Groupon can often be a crap shoot. I had heard good things about Custom Built Pizza before the Groupon became available so I was pretty confident about the purchase. . After a long day of shopping and running errands, my fella and I decided to get a bite to eat before heading home. Having spent a pretty penny on all purchases, we decided the best idea was to use on of the many Groupons I have pending. We arrived at Custom Built and were greeted warmly and instructed on the ordering process. . My fella and I both got our own personal sized pizzas and proceeded to select our toppings of choice. They have some great sauces to choose from. The staff encouraged us to sample them before choosing. I tried the highly recommended spicy diavalo sauce and chose the pretty typical offerings of pepperoni, basil, mushrooms, olives, sun dried tomatoes and lots and lots of mozzarella cheese. I love the concept and the ingredients are really fresh and tasty. Their dough is handmade and you can taste it. I was surprised by how great my pizza turned out. Since it was my first visit, I erred on the side of caution, but I look forward to my next visit where I plan on being a little more adventurous with my toppings and trying their whole wheat dough as well as one of their dessert pizzas.","For such a nice looking restaurant the service is rather weird. You get seated at a table with menus (remember your table number!). You're told that once you're ready to order to go up front to order. What happens if you have a lot of people? Does one person go up and remember everyone's orders? Do you go up separately? It's just a really weird system for what I was assuming is a sit down restaurant. I suppose it's a bit like Nando's. . The food is okay, nothing to write home about. The hummus is very good though. . I've had the falafels, the lamb platter, the butter chicken pizza, all of which were pretty unspectacular. The pita's pretty cool as it comes out piping hot and full of hot steamy air but it cools very fast and once its cooled its not that great. . Service is stale and robotic.","Great food, clean and delicious, great service. Wide menu to choose from; did not try the pizza.","Love this place! We've ordered the buffalo chicken and the fire and brimstone and both are really good! But the fire and brimstone was our fav! The antipasto app and s'mores nachos are both winners too!! They also have BYOB which is awesome! So bring your own bottle of wine, order a pizza and hang out on their beautiful patio!","Where do I start!?? We found this place by accident. . Food. . . excellent! We ordered the smoked meat poutine (first time trying this and it was amazeBalls!), smoked meat pizza, qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois pizza, and four cheese lasagna (I gained 20 lbs by just looking at it #fatKidproblems). . . ALL of it was delicious. Each entree portion size was enough to feed 2 people. . Staff. . . extremely friendly and attentive. The owner (I think he was the owner. . . if he wasn't, he should be!! Give that man a raise!) interacted with us and was exceptionally kind. . Ambiance. . . casual and comfy. Location. . . located in Old Montreal. We went after a long day of walking the city and visiting the museums. It is a great place for lunch or dinner after cite seeing. Also located near unique stores, shops, and bars. Great spot. . Price. . . a little pricey. Definitely not a #brokecollegestudentswag type of place but worth it. . The ONLY reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it did not have a baby changing table in the bathroom so I had to change my 1 yr old son on a table in a chilly stairwell. I think this is an easy fix for their management. They just need to invest in a wall mounted baby changing table. . . it can't be that expensive. . In summary, my family loved this restaurant and we would definitely go there again.","This place is your average 'ole diner. Nothing too amazing and nothing too horrible. They seem to focus on their pizza selection, but I had a club sandwich which was pretty good. I also even tried their big cookie dessert which was alright as well. Service was quite amiable but nothing stands out about this place in the very end.","Came on a Saturday for lunch with the family, Sesame Street Live was on right out front. Only had to wait a few minutes for a table. Service was a little slow for how many tables are actually in the place. Food was amazing of course, we have been to 2 other locations, got a custom pizza. Friendly staff, very accommodating. Will always recommend!","We didnt realize the restaurant was attached to a hotel, so at least it has that going for them. . Came here for brunch, and while the menu was impressive and the service was fantastic the food was just not. The portions were ok but the main ingredient of the dishes were are so sparse. . The Smoked Salmon bagel for 13. 50 should have more than one sliver of salmon. Same goes for the salmon egg white omelette. The sausage hash was ok, and the pizzas were tasty, just very greasy. . My son barely touched his grilled cheese as it was very dry and had an embarrassingly thin layer of cheese. . We enjoyed the brioche French toast the most. . All in all the ambience was nice and the service was great, but if the food isn't good you wont see customers going back.","Barro's is the place to go if you want inexpensive high quality pizza in a relaxed atmosphere. They have the best bubbly crust (I always go for the slices with the biggest bubble. . . not sure why) and the prices are definitely fair. . One complaint that I would have is about the staff. From what I can recall, I've never seen an employee that doesn't look to be in high-school. The high school students can be a bit apathetic and absent minded at times. . The restaurants are always clean and well-kept, and they even have a limited draught beer selection.","I've been to Cibo at least 10 times over the past year and it never disappoints. The restaurant is nice with a good atmosphere but can be a bit noisy. On weekends for dinner you definitely should get a reservation. Service is always friendly and quick!. Caesars here are excellent, as is the pizza - I think I've had every one and liked them all. Pretty disappointed they changed the menu and got rid of some favorites like the eggplant dip, and do I really want to pay $7 for roasted nuts? But overall the appetizers are good as well, especially the deviled eggs (although they are kind of ugly with runny yolks). The rest of the food is excellent, and the pastas always taste fresh and delicious. Good price as well. I'll definitely keep coming back here!","I loved it! Not only did I have the opportunity to create my own pizza, I also had a choice of sizes! Unlike the other places that only have one size, I was able to choose between a personal pan or bigger or even one with a thicker crust! Oh no they didn't! Then there is a big variety of choices that are not typically available at other places. I decided to create something that I never have done before, veggies on my pizza. . . . . . . . who does that? Then I topped off the pie delight with Mike's Hot Honey! Sweet like honey with a, wait for it. . . . . . . . . . little spicy kick! The staff were great too! I loved it and am looking forward to going again!","Went to the new MinderBinder last night for the first time since it's been closed. Great looking place, service was good, food was good. Shrimp cocktail and panko crusted shrimp were very good; burger was excellent; pizza was good - better than expected to be honest (home made sourdough crust was tasty); chicken tenders were good too. We'll definitely go back to hang out on the patio with friends and just relax (rained last night unfortunately). Waaaay cleaner than the old MinderBinder - thank god!  Upstairs bar looks like fun too - just miss the old table shuffleboard that they used to have upstairs - I hope they bring it back!!!","Service was mediocre the last time i went. Waitress was nice, but took a long time to get our food (more of the pizza makers fault, not the waitress). Not the best pizza either. It was alright, but ive had a lot better. . I've had a better experience at this location, but the last one really kind of hurt my opinion of this Pizza Hut.","Came in on a Saturday afternoon. Very large place. Wasn't busy at all with 4 tables being full. Quick service and got me seated with a root beer quickly. They do serve alcohol. I ordered a Little Joe Taco Joe Pizza. The place was very clean and the temp was perfect. The good do some repair on some of the seats is a small complaint. Baseball was on the TV in front of me and country/pop played overhead. There is plenty of parking here. The decor is great with neon beer signs up everywhere and tasteful paintings up on the walls. They do have a quick carry out service available and delivery. The pizza was very good and I made some good talk with my server who was very nice. This place is definitely recommended!","This is our favorite Italian-themed restaurant. We often go there with friends and family since it's nice, open, clean, friendly and the food is usually great. We are huge fans of the pizza and caprese salad which is our typical fare, although we've enjoyed many other items on their menu. The patio is wonderful during the right time of the year, and it gives the whole room a wonderful spaciousness. Service is usually great. . . with some of the staff remembering us from previous visits. . Why not 5 stars? I guess I'm not an easy grader. It really is a wonderful place to dine on a regular basis.","I always get the pizza square. It is $1. 75 (taxes included). But you have to ask for the square. Almost every location hides them!!! The slice brings more profit.","My coworkers and I had dinner here after our conference ended for the day. The food was good and our server was good too. As I try not to eat dairy, I had a salad. I tried the ARUGULA &amp; FENNEL salad  with LEMON, SPANISH ESTATE OLIVE OIL, SHAVED MANCHEGO PICANTE. . My coworkers each had a pizza. They are huge and definitely need to shared. . One had the PICANTE pizza - GHOST CHILI SALAMI, SHISHITO, CALABRIAN CHILI, ROASTED SWEET PEPPERS.  The other had the GOTHAM pizza - PEPPERONI, SAUSAGE, SALAMI, MOZZARELLA, GRANA PADANO.  I tried the Gotham and it was really good. Lots of good crispy meat.  . Definitely a good place for a casual meal. Good pizzas, good drinks, good salads.","The best of the best when it comes to Italian! The wood-fired pizzas use only the best ingredients - and are the best for miles around. The owners treat everyone like family. If you can make it that far, the desserts - especially the coconut cake - are madness! And more than enough for two!","Excellent pizza &amp; wings! Great coupons, too, if you can find them. The house wine is reasonable as well. Will return!","Fresh goat milk, tomato jam and out-of-the-oven pizza! Delicious place to bring OOT guests or meet up with friends while enjoying their lush green grounds in the shade. Kids love petting the goats and running around the huge grounds. A lot more space than their previous location off the 101 and everyone is so nice and inviting. Visit weekly as they close for the season once it gets hot out.","Not sure why there are so many negative reviews. My husband and I loved it! Very quaint, perfect music choices, great wine,  beer and cocktail selections. He got the pollo pizza, which had just enough kick to it and full of flavor. I had the Arugula salad that I loved. Perfect combination of ingredients that paired perfectly with the fresh bread and my Kono Sauv Blanc. Our server, Robin, was great! Next time we are in the area, we will definitely be back! Thank you!","2 stars only because the pizza was good. WORST delivery driver EVER. He should be fired. Called me to ask where he was supposed to deliver and i was like what the heck i gave you guys the address and he said he has the address but he's not gonna drive around trying to find the hotel. Are you serious? He had the most unpleasant attitude and demeanor when he finally arrived. Oh and before that, someone calls me from the restaurant asking me for my credit card number. I was like,  uh i am not giving you that since i ordered through grubhub. The guy on the other line figured out he was calling the wrong person and apologized but i mean still. . . calling a cuatomer for their credit card number is just funny business. I'll pass on this place next time I'm in vegas.","I've been coming to Madison for two years and this has been the best meal an experience so far. Great pizza, beer, and service!","Worst pizza ever. While I enjoy a superior pie, I'm not very picky. It's really hard for me to say a pizza seriously sucks. No matter how desperate I am for food, I'll starve before ordering from here again. . In addition, the delivery driver wanted to make a stamp of my debit card with one of those old school machines. He also actually made a joke about running down to Florida to max it out. Creeper, I think not.","Great little place if you are looking for a casual bite. The roasted brussel sprouts were yummy, as well as the dinners: chopped salad and marinated tomato and arugula pizza. The lasagna was okay, not great. Good, but slow service, decent wine list. Seems like pizza is definitely the way to go here.","I went here for lunch with a large group. I thought the menu selections were unique and gourmet. We ordered the Fried Asparagus and they were lightly battered and fried to perfection. Delicious. My friend is Gluten Free and they have a menu just for GF items. . . . she had some type of pizza that looked and tasted delicious. We didn't have any alcohol it was a work lunch, so I can't speak to that.","Visited on 12/3/17 in the evening. Who the heck is in charge of this store? The walk up counter is filthy, not a menu in site and the staff left me standing here for over five minutes without greeting me even though two employees walked right by. Was told 15/20 mins on my carry out pizza order and 35 mins later. . . nada, and same problem again trying to get attention of the staff. You can hear personal convos from the back perfectly clearly and yet no one seems concerned in actually helping customers. Honestly, just go elsewhere, this place is a MESS!","Don't tell you that pizza isn't available till 4. Out of chicken sandwich and cod had bones. Very disappointed","Wow, I am surprised at how good of reviews Enzo's has on here. I admit, that's why my family chose to give this place a try instead of going to Cugino's for some yummy Italian. . Seriously though, the people giving this place awesome reviews must be the same people that pack Olive Garden every night and think that they have good Italian food. . The sauce was super bland. On the pizza and as a dipping sauce, not impressed and of course as is with Italian, if the sauce isn't good, most of the dishes made with it aren't either. My husband and mom both agreed the best way to describe it was like tomato soup. The pizza and pasta had the same blandness, due to the sauce. . On the plus side, the service was very good and the owner super friendly. And the decor inside was just gorgeous!  Just wish they had better Italian!","When I go out for pizza, I like to get something that I couldn't make at home. Something unique with lots of flavor. Pizza Pit does not disappoint. Not only do they have taco pizza that is delish, but the BLT is my new favorite. The owner is super nice, and they have a Pit Club with discounts including free pizza rewards. I can't wait to go back and try the other pizzas on their menu. So yummy!","I would love to say this is great pizza, but after my 4th visit, I have to face facts. The concept is ideal (Neapolitan stone oven),  the choices offered are tantalizing (rosso or bianco; nice ingredient combos);  the pizzas come fast and hot - - it's a great place for a quick, tasty meal, and very good value, really. . But where Novanta misses, where it consistently lacks,  is the kind of alchemy that makes for succulence, for deliciousness, and for ultimate pizza satisfaction. The pizzas look great, they have some nice aspects to them, but they are just not a delectable, satisfying whole, as pizzas go, and I think the main problem is a crust that is as clunky in texture as it is disharmonious in flavor. A Neapolitan crust should blend dancingly with the toppings - - crisp here, almost sloppy soft there - - and always bright and enchanting. But for me, the crust at Novanta is not particularly tasty on it's own - - more dark cardboard than fresh, bright wheatiness in character - - and in my last tries it has also been over-toasted, so it starts to have a flavor that is like a blend of whole wheat toast and tree bark (see attached picture). . The ingredients all look splendid,  but, again, something in the alchemy of flavors that makes for a great pizza is missing. The mozz is excellent, the sauce is good,  but on the capricciosa the ham had little character, the peppers had an over-cooked casserole-ish sort of flavor - - and you add it all together, and flavor-wise, it just doesn't WORK.  (Though, admittedly, it can be difficult to get meats and veggies that have actual character and flavor, in the upper midwest. )    My prior pizza, a couple months back,  the salciccia also just wasn't a cohesive flavor ensemble, and the crust again killed it. (I've also had the 4-cheese twice, and once it was sublime, and the next it was unmemorable. ). Although I would love to say this is great pizza, I'm afraid it just isn't. The concept seems right,  but there is just something missing in the flavor profile of the ingredients, and in the final execution. Making great pizza is  an art - - and although this is high concept pizza, elaborately constructed,  it is simply missing the alchemy that makes for a succulent color/texture/ flavor bomb.","This place continues to raise prices and serve inferior food- my $14 pepperoni and onion pizza, with a handful of onions plopped in the middle of a few pieces the pie was cut into 9 pieces and the crust is black. . . Food fight is right! Keep serving this shit food and I'm gonna start a fight! Terribly inconsistent and the last time I was there the pizza man was in the bathroom with me and didn't bother to wash his hands when exiting-guess he couldn't read the multi lingual sign!","DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS PLACE. . . We live only a few blocks away, but ordered pizza delivered.  1st time fast &amp; pizza good, 2nd time slower and pizza OK, 3rd time. . . WELL - took over an hour to get pizza and we had ordered cheese sticks this time - so Everything was COLD and the pizza was Horrible. Called to complain - was told \"oh sorry, we were busy, \" felt very Put Off and asked to speak with the manager and was told they were out. Called the next day to speak with manager (someone in charge needs to know about our horrible experience), was told they were \"busy\" and would call back. . . One Week Later - received a VM from someone claiming to be the manager - I did Not call back, already wasted too much time on this place (and here I am wasting more time by posting, but feel I need to let you peeps know) that obviously could Care Less about the Customers!","Good pizza. The chef takes forever to plate the pasta at 9pm on a Wednesday. People have conversations about law and politics. If I wasn't in love I probably wouldn't have gone.","Stumbled upon this place on a Thursday night after a long day of driving/ walking. Saw a sign outside their restaurant for reverse happy hour (10pm- close) for a $10 pizza. I waited a little under an hour for 10 to roll around and while they don't take orders over the phone, I sat at the bar and they took my order. Also, if you check in on Yelp you can get a free order of cheesy bread! $10 FOR A PIZZA AND CHEESY BREAD?! Heck yeah!! Service was quick and the staff was super friendly! Took my food back to my hotel (except I had to have at least a slice in the Uber). It was DELICIOUS! I ordered all pepperoni and the cheese just melts in your mouth. The pizza comes cut in four large slices and the cheesy bread was so good! Pizza+ breadsticks in our hotel suite was the perfect way to end the first night of my Vegas getaway!!! Will definitely return when I'm back in Vegas!","The Margerita  pizza was good. The bartenders are good looking, charming, and entertaining. Overall we had an interesting night. This was definitely better than going to some food court.","We have been going here since they opened!!! Love their pizza, lasagna, meatballs!!! Would love to try other items, family over rules me. Would go any day!!! The staff is very friendly to every one when I go. They may be busy, always making sure you are satisfied. Do not have anything bad to say about Rocco's!!!! Love their student specials and Monday cheese pizza special!!! They do have a dining room in back, but Rocco's is more of a take out place.","I don't normally like pizza, but Caliente's makes a really good one. The atmosphere is very casual and our server was sweet and really pretty. I didn't expect to like Caliente since it comes off as a dive, but I was surprised.","Top 5 worst pizzas I've ever had. Not giving it one star because it's bearable and the only food available for order at the Fairfield inn. Salad was alright though","My family and I stayed at the Plaza Hotel and Casino in November 2016, and felt this hotel is in desperate need of a complete renovation and completely new staff. Our hotel stay was so bad it actually made us laugh. The first thing that comes to mind is this hotel is old and tired, along with the staff. . The Plaza is located at the North end of the Fremont Street Experience. The first thing you'll notice when you check in is lots of uniform security personnel who are in need of grooming standards. I later realized the reason for all the security is to keep the drunks and transients out of the lobby and hotel. . The staff were all nice, but none appeared very happy or eager to make sure we were treated like valued guest. Like the hotel, they all seemed tired. There is a $20 \"RESORT\" fee, which includes in-room WIFI, and self parking. I feel the hotel should actually have to be a RESORT in order to legally charge a resort fee. . The front desk is small with only a few staff, which made for long lines during check in/out. The hotel is old, and lacks upkeep, maintenance, and cleaning. When checking in, I asked for a room facing Fremont Street. The agent ask if I was noise sensitive, because they play loud music till 2am. Instead I opted for a rear facing room. The music coming from Fremont Street is very loud, not really sure how anyone could sleep with such loud noise till 2am. The rear facing rooms is not much better. I was in the South Tower, on the 16th floor, and around 11pm, I woke up thinking a plane was crashing into our room, only to find that I was in a scene out of the movie \"My Cousin Vinny. \"  A very LOUD train was passing directly behind the Plaza and does so several times a night!. The Hotel has a food court (McDonald's, Subway, Zabas Mexican, Coffee/pastry shop), Oscar's Steak Restaurant, Hash House, a pizza stand, gift shop, Las Vegas Jerky store, a wedding chapel, Pool and Jacuzzi, Gym. . The gym is located on the 3rd floor and is open 24 hours a day. It is small with just the basics. There are 3 treadmills, a stepper, and a lifecycle, a strength machine, and a rack of dumbells. . The pool is the only bright spot at the hotel. It's located at the South Tower on the 5th Floor. It's seems to have been recently updated. It over looks Fremont Street. The small pool is not heated, there is also a nice small jacuzzi. They have lots of seating couches, a bar, a food truck, and several gaming tables. They also have numerous pickball courts and tennis courts. I loved the protective covering around the light post, it was BUBBLE WRAP!!!  No kidding. Management is smart enough to realize there is a potential hazard of their guest running into the light post, but stupid enough to think bubble wrap is adequate protection. Can you say lawsuit!  You can rent the courts and paddle ball gear. Unfortunately, the pool/jacuzzi is only open from 9-5pm. It's very nice out there in the evening. It looked like some of the South Tower rooms connected directly to the pool/jacuzzi area and have private patios. . The room was medium size and clean, but like the hotel needed better maintenance. The furniture was old, battered, and seemed not to fit in the room. The room had a desk and chair, a medium flat screen television, iron/board. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The in-room WIFI had a good strength. There was limited drawer and rack space. . The bathroom tub/toilet area was extremely small, when taking a shower it feels like one foot was in the tub, and one foot was in the toilet. I don't think I've seen a smaller tub/toilet area. The sink was located outside the tub/toilet area, and the sink had a funky smell. . On my first night, despite requesting housekeeping for our room, we came back to a dirty room without any fresh towels. . . . I will not ever ever be staying at this hotel, and would advise my friends and family to sleep in their car rather than stay here.","The rooms are pretty decent looking after the renovations. The bathroom sink however needed to be fixed or upgraded. There were a slight crack/hole on the sink. The shower head shoots out water very slowly! I need stronger water flow. The bathroom was pretty small and not comparable to other casinos on the strip. I shouldn't complain since my room were comped but since I get comped at a few other casinos, I should try Harrahs next time around. Nothing too spectacular about Flamingo. However they do have a pizza place by the elevators that is open til very late which is great for the party goers.","Great little pizza shop in Mt. Washington. They have good carry out deals and the pizza is better than most. They do a traditional crust","I've got to give Oregano's credit, the food was significantly better than I was expecting. I've long avoided this restaurant as given it's popularity, it is always slammed with customers. I figured that while the food was probably good, it wasn't THAT good. We did arrive early (around 4:00 PM) to get our name in the hat and ended up enjoying a two hour wait. In fairness to Oregano's, we were a party of 13 and they couldn't seat us until at least half the group had arrived. No one objected to that and in this instance, I didn't mind the wait.   . The outside staff was courteous and it was nice to get full drink service while we were out there. Their beers on tap aren't outstanding, though they do have some microbrew stuff as well as the typical range of garbage beers and slightly less garbage beers so at least the liquor was drinkable. I couldn't get a Bloody Mary though because they were \"out of Bloody Mary Mix\" (note to self, never order a Bloody Mary at Oregano's). The free pizza samples were quite nice as well.   . From the time we finally did get seated, to getting our food, to paying our bill, was two and half hours so in all our large group ended up spending around 4 1/2 hours at the restaurant with long waits to be seated and a long wait between ordering our food and getting our food.  . Was it worth it? Ahh, the million dollar question. As I said in the beginning of the review, I was overall pretty surprised by the quality of the food. It was quite delicious. I ordered an alfredo dish with shredded chicken and it was very good. The sauce had a strong flavor without being overwhelming and Oregano's use of southwest peppers wins a gold star from me. They get a little carried away with the herbs (to much Oregano? yes!) which gives some of the food a gritty aftertaste but overall it was excellent.   . I also decided to order a full-size pizza to take home with me. After waiting four hours, I figured it wasn't going to be anytime soon that I would venture these crowds again. The pizza, a southwestern creation with carne asade and more poblanos was also quite good. I love thin crust pizza so for me they have a real winner here with their basic design. Again the use of herbs was somewhat overpowering but the taste of the pizza was fairly rock solid. The larger pizzas are only $1-$2 more expensive than the small pizzas (though the pizzas themselves are fairly expensive overall) so after going with an 18'' I ended up with enough food to get me through the next several days. I was quite happy about that. . Overall the experience was very positive but it was mainly made so by having a great group of friends to hang with. Going in we knew the wait was going to be long (especially because of the size of our party) so we took it in stride and tried to enjoy the atmosphere. The food was definitely good and the service was decent but the food was not good enough that I would be willing to brave the wait times on a regular basis. I'm fairly sure Oregano's will go on the list of (very) infrequent special occasions. I strongly recommend you avoid the restaraunt if you are looking for something small or intimate.   . Part of the issue with this location is that they built in an old fast food joint (long-time residents of the area will recognize it as the building that used to house a Fazolli's) and the building simply isn't large enough for the crowds the food draws. That's a shame because the restaurant easily draws enough business to support a larger building and larger staff. Oregano's, I love you but either open more West Side locations or relocate to a larger building, until then you won't be seeing me regularly. . Though, with the business they draw, they won't be missing my money either. Ahh well, at least the food is delicious.","I tried a chicken panini And it was excellent, my friend tried the chicken pesto pizza. . . it was one of the very best. . I like the place. . . good ambience , not pricey and friendly staff","Went the other night with my family. Glad we tried it but will not go back. Server was nice, bread was awful and the food was nothing to write home about. I had the shrimp fradiavolo, nothing special, small shrimp floating in sauce with, over cooked pasta. My daughter had the pizza, pizza dough was terrible and raw like the stale bread they gave us. My wife had the puttanesca and they actually put olives with the pitts . . . LOLOL! i guess they can't afford pitted Kalamata. Do they not warn people of this so they do not chip a tooth. I hear the owner is from Westchester NY. WOW is he fooling the people in Henderson. I asked the waitress why the Faux pizza brick oven in the front was not on and she said it was too hot! LOL. You would think they would have thought that out before investing in a oven of that caliber. Personally it looks like this may have been place that was owned by someone before that was smart and got out. The ownner now is clueless about Italian food and service and is trying to fool the people into believing it is authentic when it is really just. . . cheap food done wrong. If you are going to try and sell a authentic premise. . . have authentic food. I will be surprised if they last much longer with whoever is cooking in the back. Its too bad because the place is cute, cozy with potential.","Went for happy hour on a Friday night. The place is extremely loud. Happy hour selection is good. The pizza was good. Overall the place was just ok.","I've seen several versions of this restaurant around Toronto, but haven't been to one until today. Located in the Financial District, you'll be dining with swanky bankers, business men/women with briefcases, and really good looking people dressed in really good looking suits. It was pretty packed for lunch, so be sure to make a reservation. . I've gone today with a friend for a lunch date as it was nearby and didn't look too shabby. Actually that was one of the best traits of the place. . DIAVOLA: spicy sopressata, fior di latte, san marzano / 17. Actually really good pizza. I don't doubt it's antipasti, but in my opinion, the pizza had a lot of flavour and sauce that sticks to your face but it just tastes so good (warning for dates!!). It was also actually spicy, and I'm the type of person that chugs away at least a half of a Tabasco bottle for a meal (Nando's is one of my favourite places). *Almost* as good as Pizzeria Libretto for roughly the same price and in downtown Toronto. . TORTIGLIONI: crispy pork belly, red onion, capers, tomato / 16. Not too much of a pasta fan, but it's decent here. Good meat to pasta proportions. However a bit on the salty and dry side for both the pasta and the pork. It was more \"scratchy\" than crispy, but it was okay. . I guess the only issue I had with this place was the service. Our waters weren't even filled within the first half an hour and we were sitting NEXT to the water post! The servers also took a while to finally notice us to take our orders. I understand that it is a bit busy, especially at lunch time, but it would be nice to be acknowledged that someone would be coming our way. The servers weren't necessarily rude, but a smile here and there wouldn't of hurt anybody. . Overall, decent place. But I probably wouldn't try another one of the chain, considering there are so many other options.","Paolo, our Italian server, was an amazing host towards the dinner my girlfriend and I had last night. The best shrimp scampi plate I've tried (since it was her plate) and i had the Cesar salad and sausage pizza which was terrific as well. Will come next visit good job guys!","They have the best deep dish pizza on the west side. We always go with a big family and get pizza, spaghetti for the kids, salad and an appetizer. If you love cheese, this is the place to go! The cheese is so amazing and flavorful. The crust is so good and flaky. We always go with pepperoni with the hot peppers deep dish pizza. The wait is not a big deal if you get an appetizer. You hardly notice and it's worth the wait!","Strangely nestled with the McDonald's and New York-style pizza place in a food court, this is a fast food place with an actual chef actually making your dish to order. . It's an intriguing idea of choosing your veggies (any combination up to fill a bowl), any protein or combination of them, a sauce and a starch. Then they hand it off to a chef in the back to chop up and stir-fry. . It does come out fairly quickly, and you can tell what ingredients you chose. But the sauces can be a bit heaving, and otherwise way under-seasoned, salt and pepper-wise. . Also - it's kind of tough to figure out how much are you are paying, if you start making your own combinations of protein. . Not the cheapest fast food option, but a great choice for a healthy one.","It's to bad that they have lost the value of good customer service. My pizza was 40mins late. I got a nice sorry about that. . I called two times and they said it was on the way.","Came here for the pizza and we were not disappointed. My husband also ordered some cheesy bread which he loves. Food was great but the service was not that great. Waiter never came for a refill and it after waiting 20 minutes for our check we asked another guy working there if he could get our waiter so we could get our check. Besides the service everything was great. I would recommend checking this place out.","Been meaning to stop in since I got to town a few weeks ago. . . . Today I saw their Hess FB post so I made the trek!!  . . . . Couldn't have been more disappointed. . . :(  They weren't busy, or I would have cut my server some slack. I ordered the Hess Special. . . . I'm assuming she forgot about me. . . . as it took her 15 minutes to bring it. Which when she set it on the table, she apologized. I appreciated that!  Then I ordered the chicken pizza. . . . WITHOUT onions. To which she repeated back to me!!  When I get the pizza. . . . with onions. . . . Disappointment gained steam again. She never checked back in to ask how I was doing or how the food was, so I can only assume she realized she had forgot. . . . But that may not have been the case, given her service up to this point. Needless to say, after giving it much thought, I neglected to tip her. Something I have NEVER done and still feel guilty about, even though I feel it was warranted. I may call the manager tomorrow to let him know about my experience and that I likely won't be back. . . . See how he responds, as I don't want it to be thought of that I am just a rude customer that is too cheap to tip. I always tip, I always tip a minimum of 20%. I will likely try out the Mill Ave location. . . . which isn't as close. . . . but such is life. .","I've been here twice so far and love the pizza. However, the service is not as great. Both times they accidentally slid the pizza off the plate onto the bar, but I was too hungry and nice for them to make another. My friend and I also had to explain what the ingredients were to the drinks we wanted. The servers at the time were a mom and daughter so I just didn't want to be mean and snobby to them at the time. I told them they could use their phones to get an app with plenty of drink ingredients included, they were really nice about it. Maybe I will get take out next time.","Super quick, super good pizza place that could not have a friendlier staff. I have never been to Porta Alba, but am very impressed with this place. All pizzas I've had were delicious and the brick oven makes them taste delectable. Small wine and beer options, but you will find something you like. Don't let the strip mall location turn you off. . . Soooooo good. . Just upgraded this place to a 5 based on our visit last night. The service is absolutely AMAZING. We have two small children and the way the staff interacts with them and makes ALL customers feel special is rare in many restaurants.","When you walk into this open area the vibe totally changes, chic decor, chill waiter, awesome cocktails, everything about this place is absolutely warm and vibrant. It was my sister's birthday this weekend and we went in with a  part of 25. The manager was more than accommodating with our table arrangements and offered to add an extended table. We were all greeted by our waiter, one per table and he immediately recommended that one person was in charge of ordering all the food. Johnny Smalls is an AUCE tapas joint, $19. 99 with a players card (which can be used for up to two ppl) or $25. 99 without it. Small portions that enables you to sample almost everything. Unfortunately, the taste and quality of the food doesn't quiet measure up to the hyper of the restaurant. The japanese sashimi's and rolls were dry and tasteless, the sliders and fried foods were mediocre. . . . salads, pizzas, dips were average. . . a mixture of salty, bland, dry. . . . not so sure how to sum up the food. . . . the food wasn't so terrible that it deserves a two, not great to deserve a four. . . three stars, but i dont think i will be back anytime soon!","Really enjoyed this place. Went with a large group on Sunday at noon. The party package was perfect. Two hours of bowling, unlimited pizza and drinks and gift cards for the arcade. The facility is nice, the staff were friendly and helpful and everyone had a great time. The music videos playing above the lanes was nice. Only thing that could have been better is if each bowler could choose to have bumpers or not instead of the whole lane having to agree.","Make it 3 1/2 stars. . If you want NY style pizza that's exactly what you get. Not that real NY pizza is the best mind you (far from it) but it makes for great comfort food. And this one is not tasteless like \"Tony of Charlotte\"s pizza. Hey Tony NY called and they want their subway map back, you fake!. I had a slice of Sicilian with extra cheese the first time (Yes!) and a plain slice the second time. If you saw the pizza that Trump shared with Palin this is it. It tastes exactly like the pizzeria from across the street back when I lived in New Yawk, at least before the Greeks took over and ruined it. Plenty of cheese (extra would be an overkill) good sauce and a huge slice for $2. 45. . No, it's not crispy! NY style  pizza NEVER is -other than Frankie's in Miami, I don't know how they do it. Not even Ray's Pizza* was crisp. NY style is rich, gooey and runny. And you tap a paper napkin on it to absorb some of grease so it doesn't run all over your chin. This is not fine food, it's pig-out comfort food. I've long outgrown this stuff. For dinner it's crispy, thin crust brick (open) oven or nothing but a slice for lunch . . . hits the spot like the good old days. . Wanna know what's not authentic about this joint? No freaking way that you'd have to wait for a simple slice in NYC, especially not ten minutes like you do here. Are you kidding me?. I haven't tried any of their toppings and honestly they didn't look too famous, I'd stick to the plain slice or the Sicilian w/extra cheese. . *  Ray's pizza became famous in the seventies, there was only one location and it was called just  Ray's Pizza - the night shift cabbies stopped there at 2 -3 am, that's how the word spread around. All these \"Originals Ray's\", Famous Ray's are just copycats. A thanks to Mike S.  for reminding me!","Food was good! But they always run out of deep dish pizzas so if you want one. . You'll be having an early dinner. . Service was good! . Wait times are very long. Hostess told us 2+ hours, the only saving grace was they text you so you don't need to stay at the restaurant. . No reservations are allowed.","I am giving Cala's 5 stars because their pizza is good. The staff is consistent. Cala's is there for ya - being dependable. . I get their pizza to go, sometimes we eat in. The inside is kinda lame. . . But sometimes we want super fresh pizza right out if the oven. We also get 6 wings and a salad with house dressing. Dag! I wanna go! . The waitresses are always friendly normal people, most people don't seem to eat in honestly the atmosphere is kinda awkward. But I'm giving it five stars for what it is not 3 stars for everything it is not. . Don't take a date there, don't have a business meeting there, but go there in very casual clothes when you have an evening when you don't want to put forth any effort to impress anyone. . Or get take out pizza.","I really love this place!  Being Italian, I was a bit skeptical, but when a friend recommended it we tried it. The crust is delicious. What a great choice of toppings and sauces too. The wheat crust is also delicious, however it tends to get a bit burnt in that hot oven. The people there are great, too. My only critique would be that one of their \"young\"employees doesn't wear gloves when putting the toppings on. I understand that it's hard to wear gloves when making the dough part, but most of the guys do wear gloves to put the toppings on, with one exception. I hope that if management sees this they'll be a bit more careful. Thanks for a great little pizza at a great little price!","Can't get better than Sundance!  The different movies showing here always make it interesting. We love the ability to select our seats by buying our tickets online. We usually grab a bite before the show but the pizza was good when we ordered it here. Popcorn has different flavors to sprinkle on which makes it fun. They always have the wine we like. The theaters are always clean. Seats are comfy and rock and it's never too cold in the theaters. Bathroom gets a little busy and could be cleaned a little more frequently.","The downtown outpost of Crazy Jim's has never disappointed. it's hard to label the type of food at this place. But it's good for groups, because you can choose from among various mediterranean items, burgers, pizza and more. Kind of a diner with a Greek slant. . It's not fancy, just solid delicious food. The pitas rule, whatever you stuff in them. Their gyro meat is flavorful, tender and not dried out. Surprisingly, the made to order pizzas are really good too. A thicker crust than I enjoy anywhere else, but damn good. . My favorite thing is their steak meat on a pizza. It's like chewing up an italian beef sammich with red sauce, and spitting it onto a pizza stone. That probably doesn't sound as good as it tastes. . If you haven't explored the menu yet, you should.","Second time we've been there. And honestly still needs a ton of work on service. The first time was awful we left after sitting at the table for over 20 mins before anyone would even look at us. That was months ago. It took me this long to give it another chance. Tonight was better, but still not great. Waited forever when we were finished eating. The energy and effort there is just really sub par. The pizza was good not great. Not sure if we will come back. There are way too many pizza places to choose from.","Location/Service. - restaurant has now moved to ground floor of a new parking lot structure by 251 consumers rd. - perfect for customers working nearby the office buildings, parking might be a little tricky. - high ceilings bright lightning with limited seatings (around 16-20 people). - friendly staff, fast with service. - mostly a take-out kind of place. Food. - tried their classic Veal Sandwich, which you can choose how much sauce you like. And it's how much the staff will dip the veal into the sauce. - I chose full sauce thinking the veal would be dry. Surprisingly, it's not! Cooked to the right level where it's soft and easy to chew. Thinly sliced but massive size. - also liked the bread, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Nothing like a hard bread/baguette. - sandwich itself is around $7. 50, so it's a pretty good grab for lunch . - definitely want to try their meatball or eggplant sandwich next time. - also serves pizza and salad/soup","I'm no pizza expert by any means but I have probably eaten hundreds, possibly thousands, of pizzas in my lifetime and this one definitely made an impression on me!. My friend and I have been in search of a good deep dish pizzas in the Phoenix area for quite some time now and one that embodies what Chicago style truly is. This pizza was really, really, really good. As I learned from Chicago pizza eating experts, the crust should be light, flaky and almost biscuit like. The crust did not have that texture. It was denser. The slices are indeed thick as expected. It was my first time eating a pizza with the sauce over the cheese, and I was told, \"this is as it should be. \" It didn't matter to me how it should be though because I loved every bite of it! I don't care if it's in a not so great part of town! I am coming back for more and I am recommending it to people looking for extra good deep dish pizza!","Good but not great pizza; great atmosphere, very good service. We've visited multiple times and have tried most of the menu. Wood-fired pizza is widely available in the area now and the only thing that really distinguishes the Dal Forno offerings are the higher prices. . That being said, the open area bar is unique and trendy and is worth a first or an occasional visit, but there are better options for wood-fired pizza lovers.","Bang another spot were you can't go wrong. So far I have had the pizza the pasta chicken parmigiana And the Hamburger, they flame grill the burger it's not on a flat top so it's like a BBQ burger. Ask them to do something like put things on side it's no problem for them. So do your self a favor go for lunch or dinner or order for delivery you will be happy.","This is our fave family spot: dine-in and take-out! The service, the food and the friggin crust keeps us coming back over all these years. We can't tell you much about the menu bc we always get the Deluxe Chicago style pizza with the ever-so-amazing Garden Salad (add turkey &amp; ham) with their house dressing that is to die for!","I am basing my review on their pizza and boneless wings. I have not tried any of their other dishes to know how they are. We got the pepperoni pizza and some honey hot boneless wings. Both of these were much better than I had expected!  I was pleased with the flavor of the pizza and I looove pizza. If it's not good I will be disappointed! This did not disappoint. . The boneless wings come in a few different flavors but my favorite is the honey hot. This meal makes for some good comfort food. We ordered out but I have dined in there many times as well. It's a nice clean atmosphere with TVs if you're into watching sports.  (Which I am not however the hubby is). I don't really have any complaints about this place. It's a keeper!","Wife and myself shared a forger pizza with alcohol milkshakes. Both were very good. Lots of tv to watch football. When you walk out you are right in the casino. Service had been really good.","Ordered two personal pizzas, a cheese and a Mariachi, both of which were fantastic. Ordered online and the food was ready exactly when the webpage said it would be (10 minutes). . No idea why someone said the place felt unsafe. There are no unsafe areas in South Park.","Decided to check out this place before the long drive back to Cali. . After a busy weekend of participating in a wedding, having some Vegas fun, and spending money on a lot of overpriced Vegas stuff. . I mean $15 for a 2 mile cab ride. . Vegas is trying to recover from the depression the wrong way, but I degress. . We were not disappointed choosing this place. . The place is in a typical strip mall nothing special but when you walk in you instantly feel like being in NY (at least if you ever lived in NY and know the feeling)with the way the place looked, to the NY pizza smell to the NY attitude from the owner. . We ordered a large pie and a couple of sodas, perfect meal after a long night in Vegas. . The pie took me back to NY. . Thin crust, crispy, big floppy foldable slices. . The cheese was high quality as well as the pepperoni. . The place is small and quaint with a small dinning area in the back that is decorated with old Italian family pics and other NY themed items. . The whole meal cost $20 which to me was awesome as I get the feeling Vegas # 1 goal is to suck the money out of you on all levels not just gambling. . I mean $15 for a 2 mile cab ride, you get my point. . . This is definitely a go to place and we plan on going back again when we visit the next time. . . . If you are tired of days spent paying too much for too little or even if you want a great pizza at a very reasonable price I highly recommend Rocco's. . Some of the best pizza I have ever had. .","Went there this evening with my parents and one year old baby. 2 stars because everyone was so nice and accommodating to the little. I don't take my daughter restaurants much so it was nice the waitress was so friendly. The food was mixed. Wings were unevenly cooked and one carrot and two old celery sticks with one order, the other order had 3 old carrots and no celery. I ordered the small antipasto salad and half of the lettuce was nearly black (old/wilted) and drenched in salad dressing. The pizza had uneven cheese, a few slices with none at all :( we didn't complain because the server was so nice and we even tipped her 40%. The staff even took pics for us and greeted us throughout the dinner. So sad to be disappointed with such a potentially great place.","Sophie's pizza is more of a deep dish style. I ordered pepperoni and mushroom. Overall the pizza was fine but nothing special. Nothing really stood out for me except the sauce. It was slightly sweet and had a distinctive spice like nutmeg, or something I'd equate to baked sweets. Definitely not how I like my sauce to taste. The amount of toppings were adequate for the style. And the crust was fine too. . I also thought it was expensive, $15. 50 for a 10\" two topping pizza. . I will not go back.","This place makes a good pizza, but they charge you extra for using a credit card, and they do it without telling you. After I questioned the price I was told about the extra fee. If they don't want to take credit cards, then they shouldn't accept them. Bad way to conduct business.","As with most chain restaurants each location is similar but can be slightly different, this location however everything either goes very well or a complete disaster!. For some reason the waitresses here seem to be lost, nothing against them but the waiters are much better. . The reason I started to frequent this location more was for a server who no longer works here named Jason, but I have also recently discovered Josh and Taylor who are also as great if not better!. As for the food, alot of times you have to wait for fresh bread to be made, which honestly maybe that isn't a bad thing because then you end up with hot bread and hopefully not overeat all those carbs!. I like to get the pizza, it has a nice thin crust and I usually have some leftover for lunch the following day so it makes two meals for me and it is very reasonably priced as well. . Don't forget to use your CAA card for 10% off and your scene card for points!","We came here for the summerlicious menu. We had low expectations because the food at summerlicious are typically not that great but we were very surprised that it was tasty!  All the ingredients were fresh, my steak was marinated and cooked to perfection (medium rare). It was interesting that the steak was served with tortilla chips and guac. Down thing different and I liked it. My husband pizza was so very delicious.  . We really enjoyed our dinning experience here and would recommend their summerlicious menu.","We love this place! It's warm, inviting and entertaining! Watching the pizza masters at work is awesome! The bartenders are always attentive and engaging. Not only is the pizza amazing but so are their small plates. It's a great date spot!","PHI bar is a classic for CMU students who want to grab a pitcher (or four or five) after class.  the food is so-so. . i don't think i would ever get it unless i was already drinking there. Sometimes i swear that when you order pizza what you get is grease with a side of pizza. Still, can be tasty if you don't think about it.  . friday drink specials make this place crazy cheap.  recent experiments also confirm that PHI can also be a highly effective study location, as i can tolerate reading over lecture notes much more with beer and pizza.","I would start out by saying that in atmosphere, selection, and general logistics this is a wine bar for people who don't actually like wine bars. It's a little more emphasis on the bar, and less emphasis on the wine. . There isn't a very large wine selection for someplace that calls itself a wine bar. That being said there were some great selections and the price is pretty middle of the road. . They do offer some craft beer selections a few of which are unique and not your typical beer kind of choices, but it certainly is not a beer and shot kind of place if you couldn't tell by the name already. . The menu is limited like most wine bars, but they offer pizzas (which considering they are made in a beautiful pizza oven are only just mediocre) in addition to meat and cheese boards. The cheese selections are great from what I saw, they featured a lot of cheeses that I'm a big fan of. There is antipasti and some small plates, but those just seem a little random and disjointed and if I didn't see so many good reviews of said dishes I'd recommend they ditch them. They don't really go with pizza, and few of them would properly accompany a meat or cheese board. They mainly seem like things you might order if you were grabbing a glass of wine and some snacks for happy hour. . The ambiance is loud, like a typical bar/restaurant you'd see in an urban neighborhood like Ohio City or Tremont. There was pretty loud music. It's a cool place to go if you aren't looking for anything too intimate or for someplace to really talk because it's a bit more social than that. . I probably wouldn't go back mostly because I would prefer someplace a little more intimate and with a large wine selection. That being said I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a friend looking for a lively place to enjoy a glass of wine and some small plates.","It is fairly remarkable that with all the other better options available in the Pittsburgh market serving Italian/bar food that this place actually exists. While the ambience initially suggests otherwise,  the overall experience was disappointing. Along with some of the other reviews, my service experience was lacking. The pizza was freezer quality. Along with the parking hassle, you'd be better off just about anywhere else. I rarely take the time to review unless the experience is exceptional one way or the other, and this place would qualify unfortunately as the other. Don't waste your time or money.","First off, the staff(not sure if it was the owner but I will assume so) were extremely nice. Very friendly and welcoming. Though the pizza was sooooo greasy It was pouring off it. . and the crust was so thin I could hardly pick it up. Pretty disappointed as they're only down the street from my grandfathers house.","I had never reviewed Caliente when it was under the previous ownership and I'm glad I didn't for the new owners, who happen to be awesome. . The atmosphere is much of what you would expect from a bar. People jabbering away and TV's in the background with sports, all standard good stuff. The decor is in the process of changing with the new owners, more cool stuff on the wall and the addition of the chalkboard paint listing all the tap brews (all 20) is really cool. What makes Caliente welcoming is the staff, none of who I have ever had an issue with. . . From the handy man to the owners, they know how to treat patrons. . As for the food, it is pretty damn good. The pizza is, in my opinion, the best in Bloomfield. It is obvious that they use fresh ingredients, many of which I believe are local. The wings are solid and the sandwiches are put on superb bread, which I think makes or breaks most sandwiches. . Drinking!  If you like craft beer then Caliente is your place to go in Bloomfield. . . The selection on tap is fantastic with Hercules Double IPA, Raging Bitch Belgium IPA and Dogfish Head Burton and Baton only to name a few. . . There is 20 on tap in total and one will not find a miller lite or bud light in the mix. . . IF you prefer bottles, well they have two full coolers full of craft brews, including my personal favorite, Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA. . . And for you hipsters, they most certainly have Pabst Blue Ribbon available. . . . You can't go wrong with Caliente.","We hosted our daughter's birthday party at Menchies. I have to say, it was amazing!!  The manager was on top of every detail- excellent communication, even with last minute RSVPs and cancelations. I usually get stressed out during the party. However, this was the first party we ever had where my husband and I didn't have to do anything. The staff entertained the kids, ordered the pizza and even served the pizza and juice boxes to the kids. Menchies Northland had the food and drinks on hand so we didn't have to bring anything in. The venue was nicely decorated with balloons and birthday signs for my daughter. The shop doesn't actually open to the public until noon but their parties start at 11:00am. Therefore, we had the whole shop to ourselves. This made my daughter feel extra special. The event was so well organized that my husband and I left and sat at a Starbucks. We had never felt so relaxed!!! I highly recommend booking a party at the Northland Menchie's.","I was driving thru and missed nyc cooking and we found this place with many star reviews. My first thought was where is everyone as it was around 7pm and we peeked thru the side where there was a awning which only was used in warmer months. The place was packed as we went thru the front door. We ordered a regular salad, meatballs,  and a brick oven pizza. It was plenty and it tasted very close to home. The evening ended well but I lost my phone. Someone found it in the parking lot and management was kind enough to take it to the hotel I stayed at the night before. Thank you to the manager, staff, and the kind person who took it to Anthony's.","Placed order for carry-out via web, order confirmed at 7:19pm to be \"ready for pickup at 7:35pm\". Arrived at restaurant around 7:30pm, told it would be a few minutes. OK no problem. Pizzas weren't ready until 8:00pm!  Awfully slow service, and pizza's were under-cooked. Will not be going back. Way too many better choices for pizza in Charlotte.","Restaurant: bannockCuisine: Canadian. Location: Entertainment District. Address: 401 Bay Street.

I tried bannock in October and that was already after all the woo'ing and ahh'ing has died down a bit after their grand opening. This post is way too old and I am sure there are so many posts on bannock already but I am still going to do a post on it just because I want to personally talk about how much I love this restaurant. . When I first walked in, we were told they didn't have liquor license for the day so all beverages would be on the house, YAY! Inside of the restaurant is not very big but they laid out the tables really well with nice touches of interior here and there. . Ordered: CLEARWATER LOBSTER ROLL + ROOT VEG CRUDITES 5/5. *Lobster roll served with root vegetable salad for $16. 00. *This was absolutely delicious in every way possible. *It looks small but it's quite filling. *The bread is very soft (potato bread texture) which went well with the chunky lobster pieces. *There wasn't too much sauce for the lobster fillings which I appreciated because that over-rides the lobster pieces and will make your bread soggy. *Root vegetables sald was SO good! I loved the light and refreshing dressing it really complimented the lobster roll. *There were big chunky lobster pieces as well as bits of cucumber. *It had nice presentation plus sandwich was light and perfect for lunch. *I would absolutely get this again. Ordered: MAC &amp; CHEESE 4/5. *Bowl of Mac &amp; Cheese with Great Canadian Cheese and Crunchy flax granola toppings for $14. 00. *Plate comes super hot and it's a big portion for lunch. *Because it was so hot, I burnt the top of my mouth when I took a bite. . . but so worth it! . *It's drenched in rich creamy white cheese sauce and some more cheese melted on top. *There were lots of spinach in it which was really delicious with the pasta. *This dish would be good if you shared with someone since it is a very heavy dish. *Luxurious version of your everyday Mac &amp; Cheese. Ordered: ROASTED DUCK POUTINE PIZZA 3/5. *Fries, Curds and Duck on Pizza for $15. 00. *This was that one dish everyone talked about from bannock. *I love poutine, but wasn't sure if I liked it on my Pizza. *As I was trying to make up my mind, our waiter recommended it to me once I sat down so I decided to give it a try. *This is a huge pizza, probably enought for 2 girls. *It looks absolutely amazing and smells fabulous. *There weren't much duck on the pizza but it was covered in so much fries. *I liked the poutine part, but didn't really like it as pizza. *It just became a giant dough in my mouth as I was chewing it . *I am glad I tried it but probably wouldn't get it again. Ordered: PICKEREL TACO + CUCUMBER APPLE SALAD 4/5. *Pickerel Taco on steamed bun with Caviar Tartar for $11. 00. *This reminds me of the pork buns served at many asian restaurants. *It was very tasty but so small in portion (not enough even for a girl). *Pickerel pieces were juicy and bursting with flavor. *Everything went really well together in the steamed bun. *Cucumber apple salad was light and refreshing. *Would be good as an appetizer. Ordered: ONTARIO VENISON CHUCK CHILI N/A. *Venison Chuck Chili with Great northern beans and bannock for $15. 00. *My friend ordered this and I just had a bite of it. *I am not a big fan of chili (I've finally decided) so I didn't really like it. *But it was very hearty, rich and bursting with flavor. Ordered: ST-CANUT PULLED PORK TOURTIERE 3/5. *Pulled pork pie with honeyed roots and heinz ketchup for $16. 00. *Pie crust was flaky and done just right. *Inside is filled with so much pulled pork pieces. *Honeyed Roots didn't need any sauce it was sweet and soft on it's own. *It was served with Heinz ketchup for a reason, everything tastes good with ketchup (personal preferance). Summary: Bannock is always busy, and I guess people can depend on this restaurant to be at certain level (food &amp; service wise) because it's owned by Oliver &amp; Bonaccini. And they def did not disappoint! I've been back to bannock at least 3 times after my first visit and it just keeps on getting better. I always leave the restaurant satisfied with the delicious food they offer. Did I mention they have the friendliest staff ever? I officially love bannock. If you haven't been there, you are missing out.","This was my first time eating here. The thin crust pizza was good. Service was great, and they have free WiFi while you wait.","Amazing sweet sauce! Awesome and friendly service. This is honestly my favorite pizza joint ever. Keep up the good work!","While I sat waiting for my Cowboy to be ready. . . . pizza that is- I noticed a young gentlemen I think should be mentioned, unfortunately I didn't catch his name. As he made pizzas he took time to respond and greet  customers, I watched as he spoke  to a small child and made him smile! Young or old that kind of service isn't seen often enough, service with a smile goes a long way! He made at least two customers smile, and this customer will definitely be back! :)","This is our second time here and we love it! The food is really good and really inexpensive! We have ordered a regular 14 inch pizza and the ceaser salad, both were very good! The employees are also very nice! Kailey z. helped us and she was very nice! We will be back!!!!","Simply put this is the best Papa Johns in Charlotte. Consistently good pizza and great service!","Always really good!!! I usually pick up and take home and pizza anywhere is always better there hot n fresh outa oven. . . . love the taste toppings AND beer!!","Miles ahead of Terroni, and a serious competitor to Pizzeria Libretto, Pizza e Pazzi makes hands down the best pizza crust in the city. . Choose either the classic Margherita, the Napolitana (anchovies and olives) or the Diavola (spicy salami) to experience the delicacy of the crust, the freshness of the tomato smear, and the creaminess of the excellent fior di latte. . I actually prefer P e P's crust over Libretto's since it's cooked in the centre, whereas Libretto's is wet and too gooey for my taste. . Homemade foccaccia and crusty bread are made from the same divine dough. . This is heaven for bread lovers everywhere.","Buca is a small catina like atmosphere where I was ready to walk into prosciutto hanging and there it was. . . hanging. The food is great but way to over priced! Nothing special to any good Italian restaurant. The atmosphere is light (unlike the pasta your pounding back), and the servers/ staff are so friendly. I will go back and pay those outrageous prices for that burette pizza though!","Probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had. . . and all because of the pepperonis!!!. We ordered a couple of different pizzas and a caesar salad. I'm not too huge of a pepperoni fan, but I must say the pepperoni was AMAZING.  The server said its aged for 1 year. They are little pepperonis and full of incredible flavor. Also tried the cheese pesto pizza which was pretty good. Service was great, the server was friendly and had lots of suggestions. . Will definetely be going back during our next trip to Vegas!","I drive from Cranston for the pizza. I am a big fan of the crispy crust. Toppings are always FRESH. Never disappointed with the food.","Papa Johns is always a pizza go to for me. There online deals are great and the food has always been good. Love there pan pizza. Got to use a promo code today for free 10 pts = cheese sticks. There cheese sticks are truly great especially when made fresh like these were. Totally hit the spot and it was free :)","The pizza was actually pretty decent. They messed up our order though and we didn't get our everything sticks. Kinda disappointing the first time you order from a place and your order is wrong. It was way too greasy for my girlfriend so we probably won't be getting it again. Maybe give it a try you never know?","Seriously may be the best pizza in the valley. Super laid back and polite staff, great place for kids and you can grab beer from the brewery or wine from the winery! Must try the modern wedge salad--the best buttermilk ranch in the world! I loved the sausage and my hubs thought the ham was delish! Kids are the pepperoni and lived that they were little small pepperonis! We will be back!","I have been going here since I was in college. This is a place to veg out and carb load. The portions are huge and everything is homemade. We have tried most things on the menu but my favorites are Tony's guacamole and the artichoke lasagna. The Caesar salad is really good as well. They serve my favorite dessert the pizza cookie. It's a half baked cookie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate chips. We have always had great service. . The issue with this place used to be the wait. However, you can now check in on yelp and get on the wait list.","Honestly, I am really hard to please when it comes to food. . ESPECIALLY pizza. I have absolutely NOT ONE BAD THING to say about this pizza. It is absolutely delicious!!!","Yummy Greek shrimp in a tomato sauce with feta cheese served over rice. The Greek salad was ok. A good amount of kalamata olives and feta cheese over fairly standard side salad ingredients. My 14 year old labeled his cheese pizza as \"Almost as good as Papa John's\". The waiter hovered. And even started telling us about a diet another patron is on. TMI!!  I ate with my teenager for $29 plus tip and we both brought about half of our meals home in boxes. And they have APPLE PAY!!!  Yayyyyy!!!","I have traveled the world and never found a pizza that matches the flavor explosion until now! I had the egg pizza with prosciutto. WOW!!! Each and every single bite was more impressive than the last. Not only will Humble Pie be my forever favorite, I will tell everyone that is willing to listen!!","I took my wife here (her suggestion) for her birthday and we had a pleasant experience. While I can't speak for her meal, I had a delicious soup and a very yummy pizza, which was served on a wooden board. Although we waited a bit for the order, it was worth it.","I love this pizza!!  I have had it in Chicago, Las Vegas and now Glendale!!  Yes, it takes awhile to cook but it's huge, that should be expected!  This location is really big. It was way too loud and cold inside, but once we got our pizza I'm pretty sure no one cared!","We live in Agritopia and walk to Joe's frequently. The onion rings are some of the best I've ever had, and my wife is all over the fontina burger and sweet potato fries. You really can't go wrong with any burger, but I love the farm chicken sandwich. A lot of people like the BBQ chicken pizza and oddly enough the beet salad is really good, and even though my wife and kids are haters about the beet salad, I order it virtually every time. If you want a cool, unique vibe, with unbelievable food and a great outdoor setting for kids to run around and play. . . you can't beat this this place! Side note: everyone else in Gilbert knows this place kills it so from October-April plan on waiting about 30 in lone to order if you show between 5:45-7:00pm.","Unfortunately, you are limited to where you can dine at Terminal 2 in the Phoenix airport for breakfast. Fast food or this steaming pile of dog poop. . Dirty. . . tables aren't wiped. The servers clear food off the tables onto the floor using their hands. Nice. . Extremely limited breakfast menu. Yes, they have eggs. But only scrambled. Paper plates and plasticware so thin make sure you get a few extra sets as the first set will surely break. . Surlly, disheveled, and disgruntled employees. . You're better off down the hall at Round Table pizza for breakfast. At least it's clean!","my. third visit in 3 years and each time I say I'll never return. We were short on time and in a pinch but we should have grabbed some pizza instead. whats with the old. school. music? it doesn't fit and sitting pinned against a wall with a mural doesn't make me feel like I'm on an Italian countryside. My tongue is burnt because the food sat in the \"window\" too long and we paid 80. 00 for food. that taste like food I can make it at home.","Enjoyed Bevo for dinner tonight. We shared the large antipasto platter and burrata. Standouts were the stuffed ricotta pasta and lasagna. Margarita pizza and pomodoro pasta were delicious. Only disappointment was the pizza dough had egg, which doesn't happen very often, so my daughter had to have the vegan pasta. Service was attentive.","I have mixed feelings about Bar Koyoi (now called Sake Bunker, which is strange because they are not in the basement and don't have a downstairs section either). . The good: dark and chic atmosphere. Friendly and caring waitresses and bartender/manager with one waitress ended up sitting to break bread and drink with her (by then former) customers! Motsunabe and oden are traditional Japanese fare and on the menu. They are well done too. Second floor has a dart game so they have tried something a little different. . The bad: too many fake or Western food items like pizza, French Fries and whathaveyou with a Japanese twist to give it that oh-it-is-Japanese feeling. They also have the Toronto-standard Korean items because naturally we found out the owner is Korean (but has a Japanese girlfriend). Also, do not sit in front of the door, which means half the first floor is uncomfortable to sit in, but again the waitresses and bartender are very attentive, caring and polite and try to accommodate or get the door closed as soon as possible (before you get pneumonia). . Oh, and do not expect a boisterous or exciting atmosphere like Guu or any Yakitori skewers there because they completely skip over the yakitoria portion of things. . This address is the second location of Koyoi if indeed they could be considered sisters since the marquee as mentioned is now Sake Bunker.","**please see my review for Naked City Pizza on Paradise for my review on the food, as this is a review that focuses on the location***. The food here is top notch just like the other Naked City locations. The Buffalo, NY style pizza is incredibly delicious and the chicken wings &amp; fingers are some of the best in Vegas. There is a special chef's menu here that has some very impressive offerings. Pretty cutting edge stuff. If you want a damn good pizza, maybe the best you've ever had, then you are in the right place. . But this is a tavern and it's been a tavern long before Naked City took over so it really smells like smoke. But if you love pizza, especially this pizza, like we do, it won't stop you from enjoying a great meal here. Big place with lots of TV, a few games, a killer juke box system and friendly staff. But I did have to deduct one star for the smokey smell.","We all loved this place. Everything was very good! The portions are huge too. As in other reviews the garlic knots were amazing. The stuffed pepper appetizer was the best he ever had, according to my husband. My youngest loved the pizza. Their sauce has an excellent flavor. I highly recommend this place!","Excellent selection, . One of the best bbq chicken pizzas I've ever tasted, . Delicious fried green beans, . Very friendly bunch of kids they have working there. . . They just have to do something about the flies. There were hundreds of them. . They'll eat your food if you're not careful. . My grandma almost went Super Saiyan on the dang things!. Don't take a date or your grandma here, get takeout instead. They have a picture of Guy Fieri on the wall and even he's swattin them flies away.","I finally stopped in here last week to get some treats on the half way point of my weekly Saturday bike ride. I ordered the apple strudel which was simply excellent. It had the right balance of cinnamon and other spices with a light breaded finish. I also order a slice of pizza that had a different (in a positive way) taste. It had pepperonis and plenty of veggies. The bakery does have a few tables and prepared food. Ordering can be challenging since the shop has two rooms with baked goods. I found myself wondering between the two. I did not quite understand which products where in one room and which in the other?. I stopped by again on Saturday and got some crescants, cupcakes and cookies. I am quite satisfied and intend to add Karl's to my weekend routine. . A true gem in the heat ridden dust bowl (aka Phoenix). The atmosphere is truly European and the food is served with care and quality.","I love this pizza!! I get the garlic herb crust and it is amazing,  their philly cheese steak pizza is also really good!  I love this place and will only buy pizza from here when I am getting it delivered!","I found Custom Built on my way home from my hair salon in the middle of a severe pizza craving. It's not anywhere near where I lived, so I made it a point to stop here every time I went back to the salon. The Subway of pizza . . . and the quality isn't lacking. . Pick your size, pick your crust, pick your cheese/toppings/extras/whatever the hell you want on the pizza. I admit, there may be a few of the \"odd toppings\" missing from the counter, but for the most part you'll find a variety of toppings you want and like. The pesto sauce is awesome, and you can split the pizza in half, if you prefer different sauces/combinations. Plenty of vegetarian/vegan options (win!), and definitely the same if you're feeling carnivorous. Prepared and cooked to perfection right in front of you. Service is friendly, and I've never waited more than 10 minutes (for a single pizza).","talk about chicago in az what a perfect place to get some friends and family together and enjoy an amazing pizza pie. Everyone loves cheese and they are on point with that and the quality is amazing yes you have to wait a little for them to make the pan pizza but in the end its just amazing!","EXCELLENT pizza, flavorful wings and delicious potato fritters. We had take-out, so I can't comment much on the service, but they were quite friendly at pick-up. Highly recommended!","Sandwiches were pretty good and the chicken was great but the  pizza dough was horrible. To soggy. Definitely not New York style pizza.","We placed a $100 carry out order online to be picked up at 5:15 p. m. We never got a confirmation email so we called directly at 4:30 and they stated they found our order and it would be ready at 5:15. I arrive at 5:05 and was told that they could not find my order. Upon looking more, they found it and told me that it wasn't supposed to be ready until 5:15. I acknowledged that I was early and would be happy to wait. Nothing was said to me about status of my order until 5:45 when I was told my pizza was ready. I expressed my frustration at waiting without any word on status. I told them that all they had to do was to tell me that they messed up and it would be awhile instead of letting me sit there. The person then told me he would get his manager. It took 5 minutes for the manager to arrive who apologized but blamed it on the online order system. I don't believe this was my problem. I again voiced my frustration and he just said he was sorry. I was surprised that there was no offer of compensation for their mix up. Poor management of a great restaurant - will think twice before spending that kind of money there again.","I love this place!!! If you want something special and not expensive that's the right place for pizza!! We all know what is a good pizza but after you try it out you will come back again and again. .","Just tried the to-go slices, meat combo both times, and I was happy with the quality. Tastes a lot better than it looks in the pan before your slice is heated. The pricing is fair as it's not your average slice, but since gourmet pizza is a super competitive sphere these days, I'm not sure it stuck out quite enough. I probably like the slices from Five50 in Aria a bit more, but I wouldn't go out of my way for either spot, only if I'm snackish and walking around there. I do hope to try the full F&amp;B restaurant sometime.","Great deep dish pizza. Usually very tasty and cooked as requested. They offer coupons online, if you sign up for their deals via email, and in your money mailer.","I have eaten here many times and high expectations and each time it is exceeded my remembrance of how great it is. . . This is coming from someone that didn't like pizza until later on in life and still now I am somewhat critical of pizza.","Super disappointed for delivery regardless it's $25. I asked the gentleman to give me a medium pizza and I ended up getting a small so basically plus tip I paid $30 for a small pizza ridiculous!!!! Was not told what so ever.","Tr\u00e8s bon rapport qualit\u00e9/prix, l'un des meilleurs du quartier Villeray. . Aucunement un restaurant pour manger sur place \u00e0 moins de revenir d'une journ\u00e9e de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement! . Ici, on commande pour emporter. . Les employ\u00e9s sont de bon conseil et sympathiques, ce qui est plaisant. . Nous prenons toujours le combo pour 2, en plus d'une pizza sushi qui est vraiment d\u00e9licieuse.","Bon restaurant italien, nous y sommes all\u00e9s un mardi soir et la salle \u00e9tait pleine, nous avons eu une place rapidement car nous \u00e9tions que deux mais \u00e0 partir du jeudi ne comptez pas y aller si vous n'avez pas r\u00e9serv\u00e9. . Accueil courtois, dans ce beau d\u00e9cor \u00e0 l'ambiance italienne. . Cuisine dans le fond du restaurant o\u00f9 nous pouvons voir les pizzaiolos pr\u00e9parer les pizzas et les plats. . \u00c0 notre arriv\u00e9e, le serveur nous propose les entr\u00e9es du jour, Nous optons pour deux entr\u00e9es diff\u00e9rentes afin de go\u00fbter et le serveur nous propose m\u00eame de partager. . . Pour moi cannelloni aux deux viandes et carpaccio de veau sauce au thon pour mon mari. Un d\u00e9lice !. Ensuite nous avons eu les yeux plus gros que le ventre, car nous avons opt\u00e9 pour une pizza chacun (Margarita pour moi et une \u00e0 base d'\u00e9pinards pour mon mari ). Alors que nous aurions pu opter pour une pizza \u00e0 2 et l\u00e0 encore ils nous apportent tout le n\u00e9cessaire pour pouvoir partager la pizza. . Pizza d\u00e9licieuse, p\u00e2te fine et garniture au top. . Rapport qualit\u00e9 prix correct, de bons produits. A Essayer","So new place for the fam to try, but it may become the all for one place for us, movies, bowling and arcade games, oh my. It's open, clean and super fun. . . can't wait to play here more . . . oh and the food looks yummy too . . . the cheese pizza is nice and cheesy and can't wait to come back again!!. #lfthx. #fatcatsfun","Bought a groupon, and was able to buy two pizza's, a pepperoni, and a Hawaiian. I think all of their pizzas are under 10. 00, which on a busy night came in handy. The pizzas were a good size, crust was thin, and not as crispy as others I have had, but pretty good for two pizzas for under 20. 00.","Came here in late september with my wife and two toddlers. We'd been cruising up and down Crescent street trying to find a good place for lunch and found the unassuming entrance to W&amp;G. We entered and were surprised by how large it really is -- two big floors, a massive bar on the ground floor, plenty of seating on both. It was pretty empty on the second floor, which we were required to use because we had kids with us (not a problem at all but Montreal bar and restaurant kid regulations seem to be wildly disparate and confusing). Totally dug the atmosphere in this place -- wood beams, tasteful decor, big windows. . Now if you've been cruising up and down Crescent Street for an hour with hungry gremlins in tow, you don't want to have to wait long for service. We didn't. Drink orders were secured promptly, then bread arrived with olive oil -- meltdown averted! The kids and I ordered pizza, the wife ordered something with salmon or a soup or a salad or something made up of all three (as she is prone to do). Food didn't take long at all. OK, so we ordered pizza -- super adventurous right? There was a very comprehensive menu, but hungry as we were, we went simple. All pizza is not created equal, and this was superb -- homemade crust, crispy and chewy, a tangy marinara sauce, flavorful and fresh toppings, and just the right blend of cheeses. Loved it. . After, in order to delay our trek back out onto Crescent street, we lingered over dirty martinis (wife and I), and chocolate desserts (gremlins). Loved it.  . Oh, I forgot to mention an excellent wine list!  So there's that as well. We enjoyed this place and will be sure to return on our next Montreal adventure.","Pizza is better the majority of pizza in the area. Favorite is the ala vodka special! So glad we tried it again!","Dirty floors, seated me (alone) near tables with screaming kids. Waited 20 minutes so far for a flatbread pizza   Tea is all but tasteless. Flatbread is goo but greasy. My waiter however was excellent and very gracious","It seemed to me that the cashier, without washing his hands, prepared one of my pizzas. This happened last night, and he also prepared several sets of fries and chicken wings for other costumers after taking their orders. . I ordered a \"Special C4\", that is: 2 x-large pizzas, a soda and a small set of fries. While the person preparing pizzas was making my first one, the cashier went ahead and poured the tomato sauce on my second pizza and proceeded to put all of the ingredients on it afterward. Yes, with his bare, unclean hands. . When I noticed this, I stood up and started to observe what was going on since I never saw him leave the front and go somewhere to wash his hands. After my pizzas were in the oven and several other people came in I realized that the cashier was comfortable taking orders, giving people their change and then, without washing his hands, touching the shared utensils they have at the kitchen (pizza cutter, etc. ). . Will I come back to this place? Probably, simply because it's the most comfortable thing for me to do when I'm in the mood for pizza. Plus, I want to believe that not all cashiers have this awful, unsanitary habit. As a matter of fact, I think this is the first time in 2 years I saw this specific employee.","No complaints! It's a no-frills casse cro\u00fbte with traditional fare: burgers, poutine, pizza etc. A bonus is the Haitian daily meals. I was offered a chicken leg on the house once when I ordered fast food and it was really tasty. They are also one of the only places open late in the area. There is a poutine restaurant nearby but I actually prefer to come here. More cheese and sauce and way cheaper. Works for me!","I give this place 1 star only because I cannot give none. I was expecting a NY style pizza as they mentioned over the phone. . So I went ahead and spent the $30+ on two Large NY Cheese Pizzas and an order of garlic knots. . The pizza cheese was not soft and melted like other pizzas and there was no flavor at all to them. The other thing that I hated was that most of the cheese were bubbled up and burnt. My family can usually finish a whole pizza and more,  but this time each of us only had 1 at most (3 of us only had half). I do not recommend this place. Maybe they had an off night. In this economy, $30 for two pizzas. . . bad pizzas at that.","I've been to Crisp Premium Pizza twice now and I've had an amazing experience both times. Adrian, the owner, is a great guy and he cooks some great pizza. This pizzeria serves grandma style pizza, which comes in a square shape. Everything is made to order, and they use premium ingredients. Really a fantastic pizzeria! I wish they were closer to home so I could visit more often!","Overall the food is okay, but surprisingly affordable. What really turned me off to the restaurant was the extremely slow service, and the fact that all the food was cold by the time it came out. However the atmosphere was great. I would recommend sitting outside on a nice day. . The food was a hit or miss. For example, for appetizers, the beet salad was pretty delicious and unique, but the charred broccoli was not good at all (cold and served with an unappealing, ash-gray sauce). The margarita pizza had a delicious garlic-butter taste, but the formaggio pizza oddly had acidity from lime juice that seemed out of place.","big fan of the pizza here and they offer some interesting specialty options. I opted for the personal buffalo chicken pizza and it did not disappoint. the pepperoni pizza was delicious (we added onion) and our salads had an admirable pile of cheese on top. will definitely be back at Michael's soon","We ate here with my family for lunch. We started out with the wings which were really good and had a great sweet and spicy flavor. I liked the fact that the pizzas were thin and cooked brick oven style. For the main entree we had the Gotham pizza. It was loaded with lots of meat. We also got the margarita pizza. we got 3 pizzas total and it was more than enough to share. We asked nicely and they changed the nearby tv to the game we wanted to watch. Score! This place looks like it would be a tasty late night option.","Great pizza! Smaller dining area compared to the Atwood location, and no beer. . . At least if I'm remembering my last visit correctly. However, great pizza and nice people. Good place to carry out!. The \"Phoenix\" is magical! Glad to see you guys back up and running!","My wife and I noticed this place about six weeks ago, but we were unable to recall the name and never had the opportunity to try it. Unfortunately, I was able to discover the name and was very disappointed in a variety of ways. I was unable to locate their website, so I called and was met by a voice that mimicked a teenager who simply would rather be doing something else. When I inquired about the menu, I was told to go to the website which was \"under construction\". A return call, I placed an order for two pizzas. The only good thing about this experience was the quick delivery, but my delivery consisted of the wrong pizza. Normally I would call and request that the order be fixed, but the pizza wasn't really worth fixing as it tasted like it had been prepared at the mall.","Live close to pizza place. It's be good the hot wings r good. Get place to get your food fast. Reminds me of the place back in California personal pizza is the great and cheap","It has been over 1 year since I have been back and the pizza was so good, why did I wait that long???? Four cheese thin pizza!  OMG!!!!  It is cooked (or baked) to perfection. I literally could not stop eating it. Nom, nom, nom. . . . I did share with Lou, she liked it too!  The place is nice, clean, open, and bright. The service is always great!!!","This place has the worst service. Called as a new visitor in town and the guy answering the phone almost hung up on me he was so frustrated I had asked if they did delivery. For a weeknight this shouldn't be anything that should upset the business to where they get worked up if a customer asks if a pizza place delivers. For those wondering, NO they don't deliver and NO you shouldn't order from this place unless you like to feel guilty for asking an innocent question. SMH WTF?!","Stopped in after a long day at work. Was happy to see that they were still serving food until 2. Enjoyed a few miller lite bottles for $1. 50!  Ordered 2 kinds of wings bbq and honey mustard, 10 each for 5 bucks an order. What a great deal and the sauces were out of this world. Everything was house made. Also ordered an antipasto salad that was the bomb. Prices were all very reasonable. Love the vibe of the place, loved the food, loved the prices, and they are open till 2!!  What more do you need. Excited to try their pizza next time!","I've lived in the valley (tempe) since 2002 and have always heard great things about nello's. It took me 13 years to get there, but I was very pleased. The patio was large and we were seated outside without a wait. We had wine, salad and pizza and all were very good. I will return soon.","Bad service, overpriced and pizza is okay, . nothing special. I would much rather go to Little Ceasers or Dominos. The guy in charge, the owner I assume, is very rude.","I love the pizza here. . we are from NY and just totally enjoy coming here for our pizza fix. . easy parking. . convenient location. . great people there","I understand that your restaurant is 30 minutes from closing but that's no excuse to have a poor attitude when approached by a potential customer. We had arrived early to meet with a group of our friends after the WSOP to celebrate him winning. I wish we could have stoped them form coming because the poor attitude wasn't where this stoped. . For a restaurant in the Aria you would expect the hostess to be a little more professional instead she stood at the desk picking her teeth and playing with her hair leaning against the podium while we stood there waiting (literally, yes). I decided to ask if they had any gluten free options because I have an allergy. She stated they have Spaghetti that's gluten feee but it's a massive plate. Knowing I wasn't super hungry but didn't want to sit there not eating while everyone ate I opted to walk next door to grab food. By the time it was ready, our party had arrived, been seated and ordered. When I tried to walk in (food in bag, not eating it) she said she can't let me in. When I tried to explain I wouldn't eat it, she wouldn't let me in and rolled her eyes at me when I said I have an allergy and didn't want the pasta but I didn't need to eat it now, we just wanted to celebrate with our friends. . Threw away $25 worth of food to sit in their restaurant to have a pizza place not smell like a burger. Are you really that insecure about your venue that you can't let someone walk in with a bag and not eat?. Ourania, please at least learn some compassion and properly represent the restaurant you work for. I'm a local and I can tell you I will never be back.","I've had Luigis at least 20-30 times since they opened, but the only reason I occasionally still get it is because it is the closest place to get a bite to eat at. The quality and size of the food is very inconsistent. The same menu items are never really the same twice. The ingredients and recipes are good, but the pizzas have trended towards being notably overcooked on the outside and very undercooked on the inside. I have a feeling that this is intentional, and that maybe they are trying to emulate \"NY\" style thin crust. I'm not sure. Whatever it is, it's rather sub-par. It just cannot hold a candle to Cafe Porta Alba which isn't too far away. Even something like Glass Nickle is really much better, but like I said sometimes I suck it up and order because it's so very close. . Another thing I don't understand was the decision to go to full service. I thought the counter service was a plus for them, because I don't know about other people, but I tip 20% standard for full service, and $0 or $1 total for counter service, so the switch to full service ups the price significantly for me, making it that much less competitive. I used to compare it against places like New Orleans Take Out, QDoba, etc when I wanted good food without paying for service. Now I compare it with all other restaurants and it cannot compare. The place was kind of designed around the counter service, so an error in judgement seems to have been made. Also they really need new side dish choices with the sandwiches. The sandwich I had once was great but the cold noodle salad was a true joke. Luigis was a nice concept that has been poorly executed. If/when a competitor opens nearby, they will lose half of their business unless they change some things. Hopefully they will.","I am not a fan of their shawarma at all, although there aren't too many choices around UofT. How can you serve shawarma with no garlic sauce and instead put a mix of ketchup and mayonnaise and call it a \"special sauce. \"  The pizza, although not the greatest, is cheap and reasonable.","I like their giant cheese pizza the best. I have tried some of their fancier ones which are ok, just nothing amazing. Salads are only ok- The salad dressing tastes bottled. I still want to try their calzones and garlic knots.","Above average food does not justify mediocre service. The women taking our order was clearly distracted to the point of being flippant when we ordered a pizza that is one of their staple menu items. She informed us that they were all out. When I pushed further wondering if they had  run out of pizza she said \"just out. \" She had no good explanation just a literal shoulder shrug. We ordered from the BBQ options and burger options. Never received our beet salad. This was not a busy weekend night, it was Monday. We tried to give them a chance to redeem their poor service when returning to order a milkshake and once again complete disappointment. We'll try again sometime with hopes that we get the A team next time. WWGFD? (What Would Guy Fieri Do?)","The pizza here was amazing. I came here with a big group and they were able to accommodate us all. I would highly recommend this place to my friends.","Came here on a weekday night during our stay in Vegas, didn't need a reservation for a group of four which was nice. It's a small, intimate style restaurant. Really good for dates or for a quiet dinner with a small group. They offer a large selection of wines and a few cocktails. . Our server was really cool. At first seemed a little grumpy but loosened up during our meal. Their menu pricing is a bit on the higher end, so come prepared. Two of the members in the group got a pizza. Both of the pizzas were really good. Large portions, we had enough left over to take home. I ordered the shrimp scampi, the shrimp were crispy and stuffed with a delicious stuffing. The pasta itself was amazing. I never finish my meal, but this time I did. Every. Last. Bite. The food tastes especially good with some crushed red pepper. . Overall, a good place in the Palazzo to have an ambient dinner.","The wings are among the best I have ever enjoyed. The meatballs are good. The pizza was not anything special, many other pizza shops are better. The prices are higher than most places. The service was excellent. I will go back for a change of pace.","Love the pizza here, great quick snack when you dont wanna do a loong meal and just want to get back to gambling and/or drinking.","We had my kids birthday party at pony party time and we wanted to get pizza because it's fresh and ready but nope! My husband spent a hour waiting for our pizzas. We had to explain to our guest what was going on and the party ended up being a big disappointment. My husband missed the first hour of our two hour party. I hate y'all so much.","This location sucks. They continue to count change incorrectly and I'm was still waiting for them to figure out why they can't get me added their computer to order pizza. I won't be going to this location or any other caseys ever again.","Ordered the prosciutto and fig pizza, not impressed. We were disappointment that crust did not have the crisp texture or flavor we were hoping for. Tasted like it was lacking salt. Might try other items on the menu, but will stay away from the pizza.","This place was a topic on the Las Vegas Yelp Talk forum so its only natural I check it out since there were high praises. Props to Kathy B for spreading the word out on this place. It's always good to support your local mom and pop shop. . With that said I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak Hoagie. They bring it out to my table and I was amazed at how big it was! (That's what she said) I gotta say it was about a foot long. The bread itself seemed like it was freshly baked. Not bad for about 8 bucks. . If you check out their menu, they have plenty of other choices like chicken fingers, wings, fries, hot and cold sandwiches, calzones, strombolis, and of course, pizza! Heck, they even have cannoli's! They have all sorts of different specials everyday. . Service is very commendable. From the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out, the hospitality was pleasant. Bathrooms are nice and clean. The d\u00e9cor suits their name for they have all sorts of super hero stickers on their walls. . So whenever I am in the area, this place will definitely be on my radar as one of my lunch choices for I still have all of the other items I mentioned above to try.","How does a Pizza Hut run out of garlic breadsticks &amp; medium crust? Love Pizza Hut crust. I'd like to know who the ordering manager is. I was on hold for over 20 mins supposedly my pizza was going to be done in 5 mins next thing you know after 20 mins on hold - they had run out of both garlic breadsticks &amp; medium crusts. I then requested large pizza only to be told that my order would now take 1. 5 hours to be delivered. Isn't the point of Pizza Hut that it is quicker then going to the local Harris Teeter &amp; grabbing a take &amp; bake pizza? This location has now failed me 3x in delivering in excess of 60 mins each time it has been delivered online. How is this allowed to happen? This has soured me on Pizza Hut. I will attempt to receive delivery from another location but will not go to the South Blvd location again.","love this place. my go to spot when i'm in toronto. . the pizza is the italian way, not north american. the salads . . . wow again.","Lago has only been open for a couple weeks but you'd never know it judging by the efficient service and solid food. A beet salad was spot on. Goat cheese croquettes were perfect as part of a refreshing panzanella salad. The scallops had lots of hints of basil so beware if you're not into it. If you do like basil, you'll love this dish. Additionally, the scallops were cooked beautifully. A caramelized onion pizza was fairly salty but still a good dish. The pizza was plenty for two people and a very good deal. Until the east bank fully develops, Lago will be somewhat isolated but its well worth a trip down the hill.","We went on their second day open! There were 9 in our group. Two were long-time Chi-town natives. The manager was great about allowing our group to all sit at one table. There was tremendous excitement among those in line, and the door greeter was very personable. We were expecting total pandemonium once seated, but overall, we were very well taken care of! We ordered many appetizers(the baked potato bites were bomb!!), and 6 or 7 large pizzas. It was every bit as good as I remember having in Chicago, years ago. We all left, VERY full!","We Ordered large 1/2 Hawaiian and 1/2 ground beef and artichoke.  . The cheese was delightful and the original style crust was soft with just enough crunch to give you that old fashion pizza dough wonderfulness. . Very reasonably priced for the quality ingredients. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. . I'm a fan of this place.","Wow !. We had 'baked' at Nascar all afternoon and were on our way to the East Valley - in 'snail' traffic when the teenagers said they were hungry. . The restaurant was in a tiny mall with a Subway and a pizza place. We chose Senior Taco. I ordered the special of 5 rolled tacos/drink and was really impressed with the moist chicken in the crunchy tacos and so much guacamole (no extra charge !) really fresh lettuce and grated cheese. . Another Nascar 'nut' had a chicken burrito and it was stuffed with meat, another had a combo plate that looked really good, and the boys had tacos. They managed to find samples of cinnamon topped chips that had them trotting back and forth while our food was being prepared. . We had taken a chance on this little place and were very happy to be eating great fresh food while we watched the slow traffic pass by !. The bathroom was very clean and smelled great - very nice after a day at PIR !. We'll be back in November and encourage other race fans to join us in their 'fan apparel' :)","I went to Vegas last weekend for my buddy's Bachelor party, and the 13 people in our group crashed in 3 rooms at the Palms Place. I'm used to staying on the strip in cheap places like Casino Royale, Harrahs, Imperial Palace etc, but I have also stayed in MGM, Caesar's suites, Excalibur, and other places before. Palms Place is off strip just a little further West of the main Palms casino (they are connected by a Skytube hallway with people-movers). It is strictly a hotel with a couple restaurants and a small bar, but that's it. No gambling. Just rooms. . But the rooms are NICE.  They are very modern and trendy with lots of amenities. For example, there is a full kitchen (fridge, stove, microwave, oven) with steel appliances. There are shelves for cutlery and glasses. It reminded me of Marriott timeshares I have stayed that are essentially suites. There are marble counter tops, a really nice king bed, a couch with a pull-out bed, two (right next to each other) HDTVs, nice dark wood furniture, trendy Ikea-style lamps, lots of closets, and a really nice bathroom. . The shower has a glass door and there is an opaque partial separator between the sink/shower area and the toilet (that was kind of weird). But the shower had two faucets. One on the ceiling making it rain (:p), and the other a mounted hand-held shower-head. There was an attached whirlpool jacuzzi bath that was marble lined and very nice looking. There was even a 15\" LCD right next to the magnifying mirror by the sink. . I am not sure how much rooms cost here, but they were certainly very nice and comfortable. Classy and techy. It's not cheap like my usuals, but I'd consider staying here again for a romantic getaway with my wife or something to that effect. However, I wouldn't try to house more than 3 people in the room because there really isn't that much comfort available beyond that number. . The maid service was very kind and polite. We got all we needed. The room service food was very good (got the pizza, hot wings, each of the sandwiches, and steak nachos) though a bit high priced. Be warned, they often close the restaurants early on non-peak days without notice. Learned that the hard way. . Summary: Modern, trendy, stylish, comfortable (for up to 3 people). Great service. Probably a little high priced (I think the rooms were around $200 a night, but I can't confirm yet). Would come back again for a romantic getaway or something to that effect.","So we found this place on here(Yelp) with 4 and half stars. After a long hot day of softball we wanted something fast, easy and affordable. So on a positive note, we ordered by phone in and it was ready when we had arrived 20 minutes later. A++. The owners and associates were extremely helpful and nice. Place was clean. Lots of room for large parties if you needed to sit with friends and family, and also extremely affordable. We ordered a Hawaiian, maherita pizza and wings. Visually the pizza looks very appetizing and it was good, just feel like it's missing spices or some sort of spice or flavor. . . The wings were cooked perfectly fine and were very good. We ended up getting the Hot which were actually hot. I would replace the ranch with a creamier ranch though . Like I said before. . customer service was excellent and that's what would also make me go back again.","This place has amazing food ! Pancakes are bigger than my whole face . The Andy Egg Benedict was soooooo good . Great customer service. And my pancakes came in a pizza box","Great deep dish pizza! Found this place through a referral and was pleasantly surprised. Did pick up, but was still hot when we got it home. The limited delivery area was a concern, but we had heard good things so we decided to pick up and it was well worth it.","Fox's has become our go to pizza delivery. They have always been friendly on the phone, regardless of how busy they are. The Sicilian is delicious, and their delivery is always super fast.","Great pizza and great food! Delivery is always fast and food is excellent. I would recommend the antipasta salad and the Italian meat rolls!","Ate here Saturday night around 1130pm service was just fine. Garlic knots were unique in execution. Crispy outside soft in the center (5pc) served with marinara. For pizza my friend and I ordered the \"Gotham\" sausage pepperoni garlic meaty delicious goodness. Very good pizza and would gladly eat here again. The Gotham and order of knots and a coke came to $41 before tip. It is located just down the way from the poker room and near some escalators. Not too far of a walk from the parking garage if you're trying to avoid the crowd in the casino.","I was at Lucille today for my friend's birthday and we ordered several appetizers including cheese curds and the Italian salad. Both appetizers were delicious and came in a timely fashion even though the restaurant seemed busy. We ordered the queen and a build your own pizza, which were just as great. Our server Josh was friendly and made the birthday girl feel incredibly special. He was incredibly accommodating and made the experience one to remember. They gave our group a warm birthday dessert on the house. We will definitely be back.","Initial thought: this seems a lot like Nobu. Came here to dine on a Saturday evening and found the restaurant to be less busy than anticipated, surprising for an upscale restaurant in Toronto. . They interior was beautiful - dimly let and plenty of space between tables and our service was great. Our server was funny, attentive and knowledgeable with the menu. . Highlights form some of the dishes we tried: . - Tuna pizza: one of our favourites from the night; thinly sliced tuna on a cracker with truffle oil (yum!). -  Wagyu tacos: although tasty, I found the presentation a bit odd. The wagyu was grounded making it difficult to assess the quality of the beef. If it was real Japanese wagyu, it seems a bit silly to dice such a high quality meat. - Protein roll: a different spin on a maki, this roll had no rice. - Uni &amp; scallop sushi: this will be the reason I come back. The uni and scallop are amongst the largest and highest quality i've had in Toronto. - Seared scallops: we found the scallops to be a bit overcooked, you could skip this one. Final thoughts: this is a lot like Nobu. You are definitely paying for quality, but nothing too unique or elaborate to be excited about","The menu looks very appealing but the pizza was bland. The crust tasted old and the cheese fell off the crust when you lifted the slice to eat it. The delivery guy was creepy, he kept glancing into my hotel room my wife and I were staying on our Vegas trip. He kept mumbling like he was high on drugs too. Not worth the $22 price.","Came in for a super late dinner on a Wednesday night and was able to get a seat right at the bar. Located outside of the Linq hotel and down the promenade. Had a pretty good selection of craft beers and I opted for the Bacon Blue pizza. Pizza with bleu cheese, bacon and potato. Pizza took about 10-15 minutes to get to me. It's a good size pizza for one, but for two people, it would be good to split an appetizer. Bartenders pretty much kept to themselves but I didn't mind. Overall a pretty good pizza joint and I would recommend this place.","I thought the pizza was okay but certainly not great. We got the Gotham and some of it was burnt on top and on the bottom. I wouldn't go here again with so many great options in Vegas.","Just tried this place with a close friend of mine. It was a great experience and not expensive at all. The beers and pizza are A great combination. It is my new favorite place to hang out at for late night fun times. Come check them out and bring a friend.","Excellent food, good music &amp; awesome service!!  The chicken spinach pizza with goat cheese is AMAZING, as is the fresh, made-from-scratch bread. The vodka sauce is the best I've ever tasted. All of the sauces are made from scratch - I asked. The waitstaff are friendly &amp; offer great wine pairing suggestions. Authentic &amp; delicious. Highly recommended.","Worst customer service I have experienced in a very long time!!!! The person working was a very grumpy man. We asked if they serve pizza by the slice, to which he replied \"no\". My boyfriend then asks if they serve anything besides pizza. He rudely says \"there's a menu\". . After checking it over my bf orders chicken shawarma . The man then tells us it's not really shawarma chicken, but my bf is starving so he says that it is fine. I already don't trust the food quality so I just order the kids size chicken fingers to tide me over until I can eat somewhere else. We add a drink and somehow the total is $20. My bf hands him the money and I ask to make sure he got the order right. The man is annoyed and repeats it back with the prices. He repeats back a $2 higher price for the chicken fingers. I point it out and his response is \"oh that's an old menu. \" I then say \"okay then just cancel the chicken. \" Then he shoves the $20 bill back in my boyfriend's hand and says \"okay it's canceled\" and turns and walks away. I was stunned just standing there until my bf has to explain he canceled it all and we need to go.","I bought a \"deal\" with Groupon for this restaurant and they make you believe this restaurant is in the Tropicana hotel. At least that's what I understood by their wording \"Tropicana location\". For me Tropicana location is the hotel, it'd be more accurate if it said Tropicana Ave location. Also the pizza is not good, they only have one pasta dish which was very plain. Even the soda was watered down a lot. So overall I had a bad experience and it made me lose a lot of time in my day looking for this restaurant.","One of the best pizzas I've ever eaten. I don't give 5 stars but this place is the BUSINESS. The cook was drinking espresso and watching Good Fellas when we came in. Chicago style deep dish was incredibly hardy and the pizza sauce was explosive - layered with very tastey Italian sausage and different parmesan cheeses. Crust was firm enough to eat with hands, despite being loaded. I love garlic &amp; you need to as the sauce is super garlicy good. My wife isn't into Chicago style so we also ordered the thin crust pizza. It was exceptionally good as well. Super thin crust was firm - we did the Margarit with basil and tomatoes - lite and delicious. I can't recommend this place enough. It costs a bit more but there are leftovers a'plenty and the quality is unsurpassed.","Sighhh. A year after a disappointing dinner at the restaurant we had finally convinced ourselves that we should give their Sicilian style pizza a chance. . We ordered a mushroom pie and garlic bread. I wish I could say I loved it and we would order again, but unfortunately not the case. . The crust was greasy and dense but most upsetting, had no flavor. The cheese (as you can see in the picture) had a more plasticy/chewy texture rather than creamy. The garlic bread was dry and oily. . Sorry guys. There are too many other places that we need to try before going back, AGAIN.","I can't believe I'm the first person to review this place. They must have been around now for close to three years now and they have decent pizza, dirt cheap!  (And they always have coupons to top it off. )  It all goes back to relative value and I'll use a Taco Bell taco as an example. For 59 cents, it's a pretty good taco but if you paid $5. 00, it wouldn't be as good. If you're spending $5. 00 on a taco, you want it to be phenomenal, but if it's only 59 cents, your standards are lower. Now at Papa Murphy's you can walk out with a large pepperoni pizza for $6. 99 (and when I say large, I really mean large - much bigger than other pizza places larges) and it's nearly as good (if others are a \"5\", I give it a \"4 1/2\") but it's only $6. 99!  So for it being a good pizza and only being $6. 99 it turns into an excellent pizza. Relative value!  Get it? You can go now. School is out.","Simply the best pizza around!!. P. S. A large pizza is actually a large pizza. (I guess I have to write more) good pizza good pizza good pizza good pizza","When you come back to a bar twice in one day, you have to give it five stars. Thems the rules. . We wandered here looking for a nice, chill patio to people watch over a drink and a snack. While my typical order is whiskey in a glass with ice, so it's hard to be like, THEY HAVE EXCELLENT DRINKS, I did venture into unknown territory and try something fancy when I came back the second time (and then ordered it again).  . I got the fried meatballs - pizza dough with cheese and meatballs inside, deep fried, served with marinara. OMG.  Yes, it was as amazing and decadent as it sounds. We also tried some boneless wings and they were solid as well. Service was awesome as well, they took care of us nicely even when we were the only people outside on the patio (aka - easily forgettable). . If I returned to Cleveland, you bet I'd be returning for a drink and some yummy bar food!","Had a wonderful day here celebrating my daughter's birthday at iPic followed by a stop at the American girl store and a picnic on the grass with Grimaldi's pizza while the girls ran in the splash pad. Enjoyed delicious smoothies from True Foods. Love this family friendly and classy shopping area.","Love the food! One of the best burgers I have had since moving to Vegas. . . My husband loves the pizza. However we ordered delivery and while I understand that there is quite the distance from their restaurant to my home it has never taken them longer than 1 hour and 30 minutes. . The last time I ordered I called to make sure everything was ok at 2 hours and 15 minutes. When I asked the manager if the order was on its way the manager immediately became rude! Now I love this place but I was not trying to argue I was only attempting to check on my order! I was told by the manager that I should come in and not order delivery if I wanted faster service! So I am very sad to say that I will not order from here again BUT if you do not want delivery the burgers are really great here!","The only reason why I gave this place 4 stars is because the crust wasn't as doughy as my fiance prefers. With that being said, who doesn't love and (lets be real here people) need a fresh hot slice of pepperoni pizza? Very flavorful dough. Nice and crispy crust. The meats on the Slaughterhouse Pizza are super yummy. The price is pretty good too because a slice of the giant pepperoni is just enough and at $3 (that's including tax) you can't beat it. The staff is courteous, and the ambiance is fitting for date night or if you're just grabbing a slice before heading home. The parking lot could be better but it isn't Giant Rustic Pizza's fault people drive and park like fools! Anyways, it's yummy and better than Pizza on 40th (which use to be mama mia's RIP). Enjoy pizza goers!","It's was ok. I guess I am used to Indian food and while there were similarities, it is very different. The naan I did not care for. It was burnt. I'm not sure if that's normal for afghan food or not but I didn't care for it. The brown rice was not that great either--just heavy with oil I felt. The meat was divine and so tender. . My husband had one of their pizzas and that was really good. In fact I would come back to order that again. . Service was 5 stars!. Right when we walked in we were greeted and given drinks. Food took a little time to get out to us but I was fine with that and our waitress even gave us baklava for free. . I would go back--maybe the oven was having a bad day with the naan.","I've been here a few times, brunch, happy hour, late night, dinner. I live in the neighborhood, the bar is pretty cool so I WANT to like it. I just can't. I know everyone says the pizza is amazing and the food is great, but in my opinion it's just so so. It's lacking in flavor. Nothing I've had there except for my brunch was really any good. . There are so many places in this area with cool bars and great food so we rarely go unless a friend wants to grab drinks. We gave up eating here.","Food was fantastic. I'm from Brooklyn and this is the best pizza I've had since my last visit back home. The service however is a completely different story. I had to ask for a refill after waiting 15 minutes of sucking on ice. It's a shame that the service wasn't as good as the food!","We popped in on a Sunday evening and were surprised at how busy this restaurant was, and we were fortunate to get a seat without a wait. Unbeknownst to us on Sunday Cibo's pizzas are 1/2 price and their draft beer is $4. That explains a lot with regard to the crowd! . Not surprising we ordered a couple of pizzas. I ordered the Mushroom and my husband ordered the Wild Boar Bacon. They were both very delicious and the crust is some of the best Neopolitan style that I have tasted. The only demerit was that the use of truffle oil on the Mushroom pizza was a little heavy-handed. . Our server, with her trainee in tow, was very pleasant and efficient. The accoustics of the full house made conversation somewhat difficult, but we were too busy filling our faces to care much!","Fantastic pizza - WHEN THEY DON'T BURN IT! We come all the way from Akron, and love this pizza, but this seems to happen from time to time. I have politely reminded them sometimes in the past to make sure it doesn't burn. Rule number one in cooking - BE ATTENTIVE!. A second Pizza came out with wrong toppings, but the manger fixed it. Mistakes happen, but customer service is all about how it's resolved! GREAT PIZZA &amp; CUSTOMER SERVICE!. #ChubbyChristopher","So, we've ordered a few times from this location. Not really great overall but edible. This last time however was just terrible. As the picture \"This is what you can expect\" shows it was as if someone spilled a pot of grease all over the pizza and breadsticks. Both were soggy beyond any excuse. The name Pizza Pit used to mean something 30 years ago. Now it's just a name people use to brand what loosely passes for pizza. Not sure anywhere in this town has good pizza anymore, but I can say don't order from this location. Unless you enjoy a pizza that looks like it should have been in National Lampoons Vacation. \"The dog pi$$ed on the picnic basket. . \"","Dear Yelp: Why can't there be a 3. 5 star rating? I wanted to give this place 4 stars, but will have to wait for another visit to bump it up. . I have never been here before, so I consulted with my fellow Yelpers for their input.  . The service was quick and prompt. Our waitress was friendly and on top of things. I was impressed by the selection of beer, although small, with an offering of Alaskan Amber Ale. . . mmmm. . We decided to keep things simple this trip.  12 wings, medium flavor, one large margherita pizza with garlic on 1/2.  . GOODS: I LOVE the mozzarella that they use!  I have never tasted cheese this cheesy or this good on my pizza. NO JOKE.  The wing sauce was also delicious and they provided you with a perfect amount of sauce to cover the wings. AND, the ranch was NOT watered down, which I am traditionally used to. . BADS:  The parking lot sucks. We had to park across the street from their main lot to find a spot. Also, the tomatoes on the pizza were unripe. Our pizza was soggy in the center, perhaps from the tomato juice during the cooking process, and it made for bad leftovers in the microwave the next day. . So, with the combination of the both, I will definitely say that I shall return to give them another sampling in due time, and perhaps bump up that star to where I think it should be in the back of my mind.","I'm from the east coast so I know good pizza when I eat it. I've lived in Vegas for 3 years and it's taken me that long to find a good pizza place! I'm so happy and it's right around the corner from my house. I ordered delivery and it got to my house in under 20 minutes. The pizza was hot still! The cheese to die for and the sauce yum! I'll be forever ordering from here! Please never go away Bruno's  we also got the breadsticks. . . Yassss! I'll be trying different stuff next time but this place is awesome.","I am a pizza SNOB. . . . this pizza was absolutely AMAZING!!!!!   I will absolutely order from there the next time I'm in town! Service was very efficient too!","I've never set foot in this restaurant. I've always ordered online (and I'm glad since most of the bad reviews on here is about their restaurant), which attributes to my 4 star rating. . I've never really had a problem here in terms of food quality. Maybe sometimes the toppings are a bit lacking or the pizza crust is just a tad over cooked, but for the prices, it's pretty amazing food. . For $19. 99, today I bought the 3-topping medium pizza with 10 wings combo. The pizza and wings came hot and fresh. . For chicken wing lovers, they have 20 wings for $17. 99. I think that's a great value for wings that are delicious, substantial and hot. . Next time you guys want some cheap pizza and wings (the quality of the food definitely does not reflect on their prices), order from here.","Blah Blah. . Where do I begin?? Well lets start off with the basics. This used to be a Bravi Pizza joint on the Northwest corner of Germann &amp; Gilbert just off the SanTan 202 loop. . . . AS for the food. . My wife and I ordered the \"combo\" app. . It had Zukes, Mozz Cheese sticks and Onion Rings. . Not bad, interesting flavors of batter. Served with ranch. Oh they served some sort of bread thing with a little garlic or something. . Stale and cold. The only thing that was warm was the marinara. . . We ordered a 14\" pizza with pepperoni. . The umm pizza showed up GREASY. . Above and below. . Sauce or crust or cheese or roni's were salty, or all the above. The crust had a flavor of garlic butter, at least we think it did. . I hate to give 1 star for my first time ever at a SNY, but next time we will go to Patsy Grimaldi's instead and stick with REAL pizza! . We won't be going back anytime ever!","Not that great overall service and place to eat, pizza was alright while hot. . . i also enjoy a cold slice of pizza just as much a hot slice. Next morning was like biting into shoe sole. . ordered a order of garlic knots, what i got was deep fried dough with no garlic flavor or parmessan cheese. When have they started deep frying garlic bread? i prefer oven baked cover with garlic and parmessan cheese all over. . Not sure if I'll go back, i would say no but never say never.","First night in Vegas and wanted something simple for dinner so have this place a try. Had the beer mac &amp; cheese as a starter and it was very good. Great flavor and perfect size to start. Finished up with the Gotham pizza. It was very good. Cooked perfectly and a nice think crispy crust. Service was also good and attentive. If you're wanting a slice of pizza give this place a try.","3. 5 stars. . . . . . . Setting-Nice looking joint. Plenty of seating for a smaller crowd. A few televisions to enjoy. . Service-Nice staff. Young lady serving us was friendly and helpful. . Food-Antipasta missed the mark. Shredded lettuce and very thinly cut meat, which lacked solid flavor. We tried three pizzas. The Italian was okay but not as good as I thought it would be. The Tuscan was also just okay. I was so excited to see this pizza on the menu given it had ricotta but it just average. Our third and best pizza was the five cheese. We all really enjoyed it and would order it again. . Overall, the experience and food was good but was just hoping for more. . Tip: BYOR (Bring your own ranch). Did not care for theirs.","I have been to both locations several times and it is one my favourite neighbourhood spots. . I always get good service and the price is right. . My favourites are the pizzas and the Lila Salad (arugula). . Good wine. . Good atmosphere. . Good service. . Good times.","A fancy pizza chain, as opposed to chains like Domino's or Pizza Hut, is not all that common, although CPK also has an impressive selection of drinks, salads and appetizers, and even pastas. From an overview of the other reviews, it seems that service here can be a give or take, but coming in on a Sunday afternoon revealed a pretty calm atmosphere and overall attentive service by our waiter. . From the start we were taken in, as the manager, upon finding out it was our first time there, offered us a flat bread on the house. They had several kinds, and the spinach and mushroom that we got was delicious. As for the pizza, we only tried the California Club this time, which was almost like a salad on top of the pie, and a very hearty one at that. Will definitely return for another pizza next time.","This place was kind of a train wreck. Our server honestly seemed to be on drugs. He never completed his sentences, talked really fast, and acted confused and lost. We were at the restaurant for far too long due to the long periods of time that passed between sightings of him. I could get over the server being high if the food was good, but it wasn't. My wife got $17 clam linguini that tasted like plain pasta with clam flavored water on it. I got pizza that was completely average. Wouldn't recommend the place at all and probably won't be back.","Best Pizza west of Brooklyn. The reviews are correct:  It is not nearly as good as Grimaldi's in Brooklyn. But it is oh-so-good. We get out to Vegas a little more often than NY, and so its the next best thing.  . If you live anywhere other than NY, then come here and it will be one of the best pizzas you've ever had!","This is the last time Sophia's burns me with their lack luster hit or miss food. I ordered two large pizzas well done crusts, one cheese one with two toppings the pizzas arrive late and over done on tops and bottoms and cold. Sophia's only remedy to this was to offer me half my money back. If you like good pizza under no circumstances order from this establishment.","Ate here on Thanksgiving, after giving up on trying to find a buffet without a 2 hour wait. . We each got a beer, split a salad and ordered an entire pizza. Our bill was under $50 and the food was really good! We even went back to the hotel with extra pizza, which we ate for lunch the next day. . I would highly recommend this tucked away gem for a \"cheap\" and delicious Vegas meal!","I come to the Sauce often. . Normally it is average. Bbq chx pizza is amazing and the chard wings are also very good. They have a Happy Hour that I love and that's when I normally go. It's reasonable and close to work. I don't really expect anything too much from this place. . . But when I ordered the GRILLED CHEESE AND TOMATO SOUP lunch special I was disappointed. The soup is amazing. The grilled cheese is terrible. I think they made it on sour dough bread and put it in the panni press, the cheeses are not melted and the bread gives it a tang that almost makes it seem rotten. I like sour dough so that's not it, maybe the mixture of it being cold - hard and the weird texture from the panni press and grill. . . I dunno just not the thing I was expecting. I really do love the Happy Hour though and I guess I just will stick with that. Not really a good spot if you are looking for yummy lunch or dinner.","This review is for service only or lack of. Went in just before 5:00pm, it's not busy for being a Saturday. Sat for 10 minutes and not acknowledged once. Kind of sad when you see plenty of staff walking by you or standing in the main kitchen area talking. I know a few of them saw us too, it's not like we were sitting in the corner. I really love the food but this gives me second thoughts about going back. Did I let them know I was not happy? Of course I did. The manager offered to make it up to us with a pizza. Decided against it, I wouldn't want them to spit on my food.","Went with my brother to Kensington Market Saturday night and while walking around we discovered this gem of a place called Levetto. Since there is one near my house we decided to go in and say hi and check it out  Simple Italian food  at  affordable prices . My brother and I are pretty friendly guys so we started chatting with the staff and congratulating them on their opening. Well before we knew it the owner Nicholas came over and introduced himself and instantly we all became friends. He is a really cool and nice guy. Eli and I ordered 2 simple dishes . Pasta and Pizza. Both were excellent. Fresh tasty and simple. We filled up quite nicely but than Nicholas surprised us with his specialty pizza Peking duck on the house. Wow what a treat . Delicious!  We felt like we were on Anthony Bourdains show and we're treated like royalty. I wish the owner only good things for this place. Super food and super staff.","Despite the response posted by the business 6+ months after this terrible experience, I stand by my original review. The original, incorrect pizza was NOT gone when the delivery driver returned, as the response stated; in fact, I reviewed the emails exchanged between myself and the Customer Care department at Eat24 following this experience, and verified through those messages that there was more than half of the original pizza available to be returned after my very hungry roommate ate, as he had been instructed to do. Most importantly, the only real reason to dignify this absurd, overdue response to my original review is to respond to the claim that I'm attempting to hurt their business. When the incorrect $50 order was received, I asked to return the complete, untouched order and receive a refund. I was lied to and manipulated as the business tried every trick in the book not to correct the situation, finally being delivered the correct pizza FOUR HOURS after the order had been placed. Stating that they had gone 14 miles round trip to correct the error seems to be moot, as 1. ) any business with even a modicum of customer service skills would have corrected their error without question from the start, and 2. ) at no time did the reply address the fact that whomever was operating their shop that night had lied outright to both myself (the customer) and Eat24 (the business by whom they were represented during this comedy of errors). . Please note that Eat24 issued a full refund of the money spent on this order due to the fact that the Eat24 Customer Care Rep stated that all of his communication with this establishment had been exactly as I'd stated, as he was actually the person with whom the \"owner\" spoke that night. Eat24 also cited the fact that the business did not take reasonable steps to correct the issue when presented acceptable solutions. More than 6 months have passed; this situation should have been addressed at the time, when it was more than a \"he said, she said\" scenario. . I proudly support local, especially family-owned, businesses, as I myself used to be part-owner of a small business that, after nearly 20 years in the family, was unable to compete with large corporations. I will not, however, blindly support a business that, when faced with a simple error, takes astronomical steps to avoid providing basic customer service and conflict resolution.","This place is AMAZING!!! This is the only place I will ever go to see movies ever again. We went there as a family today to check it out and it blew our expectations out of the water!! When we walked in we decided we were going to see a movie so bought our tickets which are very reasonably priced! Then instead of the same ol' popcorn (which you can also get) we got pizza! And the pizza was delicious, along with the exotic variety! So while we waited for our movie and food, we drank a beer and played some of the many awesome video games they had! Then they deliver your food right to your seats. The seats, OMG the seats! The most comfortable seats ever! They sprawled back, reclined with tons of foot space in front! We were on cloud 9!!! We ate our pizza, watched our movie, while completely relaxed! We will definitely be back to bowl, golf, and see more movies!!!","My boyfriend and I ate here for a nice date night while visiting Vegas. The food was amazing!  We had the margherita pizza, scialatielli \"ai quattro passi\", and for dessert torta al cioccolato. Everything was so delicious and worth the price. Definitely some of the best Italian we've had. . The one downfall for me was our server. While he was attentive and accurate, he was frowning and monotone the entire time.","Perhaps I should give them 5 stars (demerits for a handful of dud products like the string cheese). This is is 1 of 2 stores where you can simply count on getting great fruits. I'm so done with general grocery store produce!  What prompted this review was my first frozen pizza purchase. They claim to make their own and I've never had this branded under a different label.  $7 got me a truly thin crust with amazing sausage &amp; serious pepperoni plus bell peppers. The mozzarella &amp; provolone were plentiful to the point of oozing off the crust while baking and I really enjoyed its rubbery-ness. After it cooled, the cheese was thicker than the crust. I may stop making my own pizza for Svengoolie movie nights!","I've been here three times and I keep going back because it's cheap, but I keep leaving feeling disappointed. . The first I went, I got the grilled vegetable sandwich and soup. It was decently good. Better than what I make myself at home, but still not that special. I probably think it tasted better than it really did because I believe the two together came to like $6. 50 or something ridiculously cheap. . The next time I came, I had the French toast. It was pretty bad. It was one of the few times I would have wanted to send it back but our waitress never came to check on us so I couldn't. All the syrup in the world couldn't have fixed the dryness that was this meal. . I went there again two nights ago. It was late, I needed cheap food. I really wanted something sweet and since the French toast was so bad last time, I decided to go with pancakes instead. Again, they were bad. Literally worse than the pre-made pancake mix at the store. Like last time, I would have sent it back, but the waitress never checked on us. . Aside from the food, this restaurant really caters to specific people. If you want to have a quiet conversation over dinner, don't go here. If you want to talk very loudly over top of other people talking very loudly, go here. If you want to be able to see your food before you eat it, don't go here. If you want to eat in darkness, go here (just kidding, but it is really dark here). The waiters are friendly, but they never check on you. So if you want a refill, good luck. Also, the bathrooms are disgusting. . I would really only go back here if it was super late at night, the nearby Chinese places weren't open, and/or I had very little money on me. . As per the alcohol, I don't drink, but my boyfriend said his beer was pretty good and he had the vermicelli noodles which he also said were 'OK'. The beer was pretty cheap. I think it was $2. 75 for 1/2 pint, $4. 50 for a pint, and I forget how much for a pitcher. . In summary: cheap, bad-slightly better than average food, friendly but not good waiters, decent beer, gross washrooms, open late, loud, dark. You can do better. DO NOT take a first date here. Just don't. I forgot to menton this earlier, but they also have a pretty wide-ranging menu. Noodles, sandwiches, brunch, asian, indian, etc. But no pizza which is kind of weird.","Fantastic pizza and antipasto dishes. We ordered the meatballs and the arancini. Both were delicious. Reasonably priced (for Vegas) and high quality. A great casual dining option.","They will put a flyer under your hotel door just to get you to order their crappy pizza. Businesses that offer good food have no problem getting up to 2 stars on yelp. . .","I was at KaKa sushi for a tasting event with girlfriends. Let's say that the restaurant has enough space at this location and even the interiors are pretty well made. I state that I am not a sushi lover but I was immediately struck by the balance of each course of our meal. We were literally submerged by so many different kind of dishes, some very original like the sushi pizza, and some pretty simple but with that touch that left someone like me pretty satisfied. The Chef we had that night did a great job. Let's see whether my second visit will be as good as the first one.","Small terminal compared to the other ones! There is a mini gift shop, an information desk, a small breakfast shop, a Mexican food place, and a New York pizza dept restaurant. . It was very empty and no lines at the check in kiosks or at the security checkpoint. There is plenty of seating and it can be very cold! Soda machines are available by the baggage claims and the bathrooms are clean and big. . Oh and free WIFI!","Major disappointment on New Years Eve Dinner. I decided  to return to Sapore where I previously enjoyed the wood oven pizza, which was actually quite good. Though for New Years Eve they had a reduced menu and the pizza oven was not an option for anyone. The dinner was at 5:30 and the restaurant was less then half full.  . We had a table of 4 and we all ordered appetizers, rib eye steaks at $36. 00 each and a bottle of wine. The steaks were all cooked incorrectly, especially my steak that was grilled beautifully on one side, though heavily burnt on the bottom side. While, other steaks were raw and almost cold to touch in the middle. The vegetables were very poorly chosen as grilled leaks and beets did not compliment the dish that had a sweet blueberry steak sauce. Very disappointing, if it wasn't a busy new years eve night, I would have certainly returned the dish.  . As for the appetizers (salads and calamari) and entrees the portions were disappointingly small for the price. The prices are not justifiable. The quality and quantity are severely lacking.  . Often good service can compensate, though our server \"Shirley\" was lacking professionalism. She did not give proper attention and likely did not submit our order properly as we waiting an excessive amount of time for our food considering the amount of people in the venue. She was unpersonable and unsympathetic. Even with only 4 guests she automatically included 15% tip on the bill, she probably had a good sense she wasn't probably deserving to get that if she wouldn't have done that.  . As for the venue, one positive is that it is beautiful place. The decor, color scheme and presentation make for a comforting yet elegant restaurant environment.  . I do NOT recommend. Sorry.","On 12/19/15 my wife two kids , and I stopped in the olive garden 2626 N. 75th Avenue, Phoenix, AZ 85035 (Desert Sky) for dinner. . My wife and daughter ordered shrimp Fettuccini and I decided to ordered the \"create your own pasta option\" Rigatoni pasta, Primavera sauce and chicken. My son decided on the kids pizza. We occasionally dine at different restaurants throughout the valley. The food arrived 20minutes later. My wife and I where completely flabbergasted with both dishes we ordered. My wife shrimp in her dish were very small over cooked and tasteless and tasted raw. The dish was very bland. It was so bad that she could not finish eating it and left it on the table. . I don't know if this was normal for this location or not, but I will never eat here again. . My server asked how my dinner was, and I told her that it was not very good I asked for an additional side Primavera sauce to try to possible help this poor dish! but she said unfortunately they had no more sauce??. I then stated I was very unhappy and embarrassed for them, she then stated she was sorry to hear it, and reported to the manager on duty. . I was shortly contacted by the Manager on duty by the name of McKenzie. I expressed to McKenzie my horrible experience and concerns of the location. McKenzie apologized for my poor experience and stated he was from another location and was just helping out. I was accommodated with one meal completely removed from my total excellent customer service on McKenzie part! But this location definitely needs a visit from whom ever it concerns ASAP.","Pretty good and really not that expensive. Went with my wife and kids (5 &amp; 2), she decided to go with bruschetta to start and share the two pizzas my kids got. Got the regular instead of pizette, had a lot left over but they didn't eat much. Bruschetta my wife said was one of the best she ever had. Pizza was real good, especially the pepperoni slices. I got a NY steak that was one of their specials and a side of creamy polenta. Both were absolutely excellent. My only issue was the speed of getting the food but other than that really good experience.","If you love pizza. . . . . . . . . . . . you have to try this place !!!!!!!!!!! It was excellent. I ordered to go and the guys up front were very nice.","I never knew this place was even a restaurant until I saw it on yelp. I actually thought it was a freaking jewelry pawn shop . . . *facePalmNutz.  . Anyway, while the prices are Vegas Strip premium here, a lot of their dishes were on point. . Roasted Bone Marrow - This dish was fantastic. The bone marrow was cooked to perfection as well as the carmelized onions. I kid you not though, the place that sets this place apart was the bread. Something about that buttery garlicy-ness sets it off.  . French Onion soup dumplings - While the cheese they used was really good, I didn't care too much for this dish. I was expecting soupy dumplings. . . like a french onion soup xiaLongBao. All you get is a dumpling filled with carmelized onions.  . Grilled cheese , bacon, and tomato soup dumplings - This was more my style. There was actual soup this this. Too bad they don't serve this by the bowl. . Thai style deep fried shrimp - Great dish. The shrimp was good quality and the slaw was perfect. . Roasted Mushroom Pizzetta - Ordered this by somehow it came with a bunch of pepperoni and meat. I wonder if this was intentional? This dish was okay. Never thought I'd say this but there was actually too much meat too the point where it made the pizza too salty. . Brussel Sprouts - They could have done a better job carmelizing the outside of the brussel sprouts but this dish was solid. It was a bit soggy because it soaked up too much oil. . Short rib mac and cheese - I liked how the short rib flavor got into the guts of the cheese flavor.  . Basil Pesto ravioli with Rock shrimp - I wasn't a fan of this dish as it was bland. It had the least impact in terms of flavor.  . Jerk Spiced chicken - While the flavor was good, the chicken came out a bit dry. Tear. . Scallops - Good quality scallops. Can't go wrong here. . Devils food layer cake - Imagine the richest and sweetest chocolate cake of all time. It was nice that the did have the milk ice cream to \"lighten\" the load. If they eased up on the sugar, I would have enjoyed this dessert much more. . Drinks: I had the Electric Avenue which is pretty much their own version of a manhattan. While it isn't cheap at $17, it was really good. Compare this to the Chandelier bar outside the restaurant that serves a sh*tty old fashioned for $17. It's expensive, but you get more value here. They also have pitchers of Sangria, but that'll set you back $80. Did I mention this place isn't cheap?. Service was good and for the most part, the food was tasty. If you have a large party, this place is great because you can order it \"tapas\" style. For example, you can add one scallop to the scallop dish. The waiter/waitress will help you along the way.  . 4 stars!","I live in New York now. I am homesick for this bar/ cafe. Maybe it's who I was with the nights I was there or the timat in my life but this is my favorite bar and probably always will be. I used to live on Laval around the corner and would love running over to get a hot calvacidre and split the mandatory small plate of veggie pizza or indian snacks. There's nothing quite like running head down through a snowy Montreal night to turn the corner and get inside Else's door and find the mellow life going on inside. One night, at the table next to me, a man who I am assuming was a magician pulled a bunch of doves out of a box. It somehow seemed normal. Something about the ambiance and the attitude and the drink menu and the story of the founder Else and her vision for her namesake makes this place the best meeting place, the most special first dates venue, and the best escape from the utter chaos that was St Laurent during uni.","Holy Mother! Honestly by far the best pizza I've EVER had! Ordered the pepperoni pizza and same out to perfection. The cheese just melts in your mouth and isn't too cheesy or over powering. Will be back!","I just moved across the street from HB&amp;G this summer! Yay!. I've been a few times over the last few years, checked in once, and have been satisfied to want to come back again and again. This bar is quintessential Wisconsin meets the beauty of Madison's local food and flavor scene! Strange, right? Well, get on board. The atmosphere, food, is in perfect harmony! . See what I did there? ;). Okay. . . eat the veggie burger. It really is the very best I have ever tasted in Dane County! Veggie burgers are like donuts and cheese curds to me - I have a top 3 best of each in the greater Madison area. The veg burger is unreal. Light mayo, light sriracha, , swiss AND cheddar. You're ready to rock and roll!. . I cannot recall the name of the pizza I've tried aside from the \"regular\" cheese pizza, but it was the pesto with both sausage and mushroom combo. AMAZING. Nearly all local ingredients really does add to the overall food experience. And for a bar. . . the pesto flavor is just lovely. Yummy, yummy, yummy!!!. Now, it wouldn't be Wisconsin without a review of the fried food. It's all indulgent. Fries, Yum. Rings, yum. Curds, yum. . Check this place out in the summer months too! There's bluegrass tunes to be had. . The staff is in tune with the friendly meets 'got things to do\" vibe, and two pool tables are offered in the bar area. There is an entire multi-use space across the way, which for varying game day scenes is lit up!","Super friendly service and pizza was delish! Had a little section with cute Christmas decorations. Their garlic knots were good as well. We will be going back because of their friendly people.","We love this place! The place is a good old fashioned fast food restaurant which offer up some of the best hot dogs, hamburgers and poutine on the south shore! Fast, courteous service even during a busy lunch hour. . . we have been there numerous times over the past 15 years and they always are in a joyful mood and the food has always been fresh and tasty! . Little hidden secrets; try their pizza. . . . the crust and sauce easily out taste any pizza joint around!  An other really amazing meal is the bolognese sauce poutine! Wow! What a treat! Even their smoke meat sandwich is delicious! Last, try one of their daily fresh home made desert cakes! As good as mom's. . . no joke, I can not believe the care they take to serve up all these varieties of fast food considering this is supposed to be a hot dog and fry restaurant! . If you plan on going during a hot summer noon, do not be turned off by the line up 'cause you are served up in a couple of minutes! . Last, This is one of the only places where you can call 30min before to get your pizza cooked so when you arrive its steaming hot and ready to eat either as a take out or in the restaurant. . . . If you are looking for a quick fresh meal on a budget and have had your share of Mcdonalds, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Mikes, Subways and all those traditional plastic food joints, try out this place and I am sure you will keep going back time after time! Enjoy your poutine :)","Ordered a buffalo pizza and a sandwich which I asked for no tomatoes on and still received tomatoes. After taking them off my sandwich some mysterious fell out. I'm never ordering again. Disgusting","I live near downtown so I was looking forward to trying this place. First time, I thought the service was kind of slow (5 mins for a slice) but since I wasn't in any particular hurry it didn't matter. The pizza was pretty good but pricey. After today I'm never going back. Incredible jerks who operate this place. Ordered a slice and then sat down. Wait, wait, wait and then finally I go up to the counter and they don't even have the decency to come over and apologize for not making my order. Guy behind the counter says \"give me 30 seconds\" as he shoves a slice in the oven. Apparently I wasn't the only one they screwed over. While he was discussing another botched order with a customer, he takes my slice out of the oven and then shoves it over the counter without a word as if I magically know that's for me. Kinda service I'd expect in new york but not here. If you don't care about your customers then go somewhere else.  . This time the pizza was pretty mediocre. It wasn't hot, after 30 secs in the oven. Crust was rubbery and the sauce tasted like out of a can. Probably because had been sitting out all day and they reheated it. Definitely not worth $5. If you're from out of town don't waste your time and money eating at dumps like this. Their pizzas look decent and maybe they're good when fresh but considering the service and the mediocre slices it's not worth trying again. There's better places around town for pizza. . BTW, the brunette behind the counter both times I've been there obviously hates her job and doesn't like dealing with people, or maybe she's a complete nit. Since I live close I asked if they took phone orders and did they validate parking. I'm not going to hassle with plaza parking and pay for it too but hey if you can get a pizza and parking for a few hours then it might be worth it. She says 'no'. They used to do it but they stopped. Now you have to have to get your ticket validated at one of the casino machines and she points down the hall.  \"Okay, so you do validate parking but you have to do it at the machine, right?\"  She says, \"I don't know\" and then she goes into this long rant about how they used to stamp tickets, blah, blah, blah. Geez lady, c'mon, it was a simple question.","I very much wish I could give the gorgeously remodeled Vig more than 3 stars, but the inconsistency in food and service has knocked off a star for the time being.  . Aesthetically, the Uptown Vig is just lovely. The renovation of the space was done with class, and the differing textures on every wall/surface/decor really made things pop. I'm loving the re-purposing trend in central Phoenix. . . what great use of an old, seemingly useless space. . On my first visit to the Uptown Vig, I came with the girlfriends for Happy Hour. We love to check out all of the greatest happy hours around town, and were particularly excited for half-priced appetizers. We had the traditional hot \"vings\", guac and chips, trifecta (mini-burgers) and the flatbread pizza with tandori chicken. All of the items were relatively good, however nothing really stood out or surprised us. We were disappointed at our server's attitude. She seemed immediately put off when we ordered only waters and 2 cokes (table of 4) with our food. Come on - \"real\" drinks aren't required, are they? It was a school night!  Plus, I had to manage to drive myself home, and I totally can't manage that with even one drink. I understand that we were reaping the benefits of the happy-hour pricing without shelling out for alcohol, but there is no need to be put off by our choice. We ALWAYS tip enough to make up for their trouble. . . Anyways. . . I digress. . . I also ordered the Good Korma curry dish to take home to the husband, after conferring with the waitress about good gluten-free options. Unfortunately, when I arrived at home, I discovered that they had stuck a great, big piece of naan on top of the curry. Gluten, gluten everywhere :(. Our second visit was a great turnaround. We had decided to go to Chelsea's Kitchen for Mother's Day Brunch. Chelsea's turned out to be so packed that we couldn't even find a space to park. Using our incredible genius, we decided that the fairly new Vig would probably have less of a crowd. Boy, were we right!  We were seated right away, and there were many tables to spare. I ordered the Achiote Salmon - oh my. It was an incredible dish. Such complexity of flavor in the spices and poblano sauce, and the accompanying chorizo-stuffed corn cake was delish. Definitely something to return for. The husband ordered chilequiles, and thought they were good, but not nearly as great as Gallo Blanco's version. Both of our mothers ordered the Persian Kebabs, and both seemed pleased, but not completely bowled over. The child ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, which was entirely too much bread and not quite enough cheese. I did enjoy stealing his French fries, however - yum!. Since the new Vig is just around the corner from my house, has a super happy hour, and the amazing salmon dish, I'm sure I will be back. Hopefully the service loses the slightly I'm-better-than-you attitude, and adopts a truly friendly vibe. Looking forward to that!","If you are dreaming of Naples but only have a few minutes to spare, stop by Novata to sample their delicious pizza or other Italian treats. . I ordered the Salisiccia, which had a nice balance of mushrooms, sausage and cheese. The crust was flavorful with just the right balance of crispy and chewy goodness. The kitchen offered a large selection of pizza choices so I could find the \"one. \". The restaurant was neat and clean although somewhat lacking in ambiance. The staff was friendly and courteous and went out of their way to provide exemplary service, stopping by at least twice during the meal to ensure our satisfaction. . If I am ever in the Middleton area again (I live in California), I'll be stopping by again. Five stars.","Grimaldi a pizza is my favorite so this review may be a bit biased. Try the meatballs on your pizza! It's the best. The service was good the last time I went and overall it wasn't a bad experience for a restaurant on the strip.","We ordered pizza online. The website gives you a pretty exact time that your order will show up. It doesn't say approximate or estimated. . . Meanwhile, the order showed up about 20 minutes later than the time given. No big deal, right? Well. . . unfortunately our pizzas were room temperature and had clearly been sitting for a while. We have to microwave our just-delivered pizza. Gross! It was extremely disappointing and completely unappetizing. . The delivery driver, however, was very friendly and made the transaction comfortable while my 85lb Shepard mix barked away in the background. The 2 stars are for him, even though I'm sure he knew our order was old and delivered it with a smile anyway.","I love this place and always bring friends and family in! I'm a big fan of the \"create your own\" concept and the fact that there's no limit on the ingredients you can put on the pizza. Quick service. The pizza is always delicious too. The only thing knocking their fifth star is they're a bit stingy. I like to put a bunch of ingredients so it doesn't typically bother me. However, last time I was there I brought a friend and he was almost done with his whole pizza when the manager came and asked us how it was then questioned why my friend asked for a box if he was going to waste it since he was practically done with his pizza. He said he didn't ask for a box. . . because he didn't (they gave it to him in a box without asking) so that was a little intrusive and rude to assume and judge. The pizza does taste delicious though!! Just make sure you don't get a box unless you want the manager trying to guilt you about it.","Really good for when you want some pizza after or during your partying on Fremont! The spinach pizza is my fave!","The workers are friendly and the food is good (for fast food pizza). But plan on waiting over an hour for delivery and over 35 minutes for pickup.","Fantastic food and the service was exceptional. I had the chicken parm sub,  delicious,  and the girls had hamburger pizza and pepperoni roll that were both awesome. Thinking about going back today!","I don't know what I was eating before Grimaldi's, but it wasn't pizza. Hands-down, the best pizza of my life. In the Mid-West, we have a wide variety of pizza, from thin crust to thick, and even some deep-dish. But nothing compares to Grimaldi's brick-oven, thin crust, with fresh mozzarella and house-made sauce. . The husband and I were looking for some place to eat near the Fashion Show Mall, but we didn't want to eat in the food courts. Grimaldi's popped up on the Yelp app. The location is near the \"back\" of the mall (in relation to the Strip), but it's definitely worth the trek. . We ordered a ceasar salad (great salad, but not the best I've had) and a small pizza with pepperoni and red peppers. The peppers are amazing! We split a cannoli for dessert and it was one of the better cannolis I've ever had. . There is a fair selection of beers on tap and in bottles. Being from the Mid-West, there were plenty of West-Coast beer options that I'd never tried before. . Everything about Grimaldi's is awesome. Good salads, AMAZING pizza with quality ingredients, good beer selection, great desserts, classy but casual atmosphere, AND reasonable prices.","We came to eat here for the first time and the food was just incredible! Don't be fooled by the quiet neighborhood! This place is a jewel! We had arancini and salsiccia with rapini, delicious! The tomato sauce is incredible with the arancinis and the rapinis cooked and seasoned to perfection! We shared a pizza which was also delicious! The white pizza they give you as bread could have been my meal as it was also really delicious! We came out having eaten like kings! No room for dessert although I saw some tables having the home made donuts with Nutella and the cheesecake which also looked delicious! The espresso and cappuccinos are made barista style. . All in all, super authentic and friendly place! Would go back again everyday!","Worse pizza in town. I ordered a slice  it came soggy and micro waved heated. The girls serving never washed their hands. Ate food for themselves with their hands in their mouths. Licking their fingers never washing their hands before serving my food. Gross!!! Never will U ever go back.","Pretty good. I love the fact you can customize your pizza however you want and they don't charge extra for it. Even subway charges for bacon or extra cheese. Reasonable price in my opinion since it will feed you for at least two meals. Taste was very fresh even on a slow Sunday night.","Buffalo chicken pizza for the win! Ive eaten across the parking lot at Joe's Farm Grill a bunch of times and never even knew this little strip of shops was across from there. You can sit inside at the restaurant, next-door at the sports bar or outside where they had live music playing when we went. Awesome place, $11-$14 pizzas made in a brick oven, and a perfect Vibe.","Middle of the road for me - perhaps a 3. 5  I'd go back and probably enjoy it, but it wouldn't be a go-to pick. . We came on a Friday night and were seated right away - yay for that!   Our server came by quickly to take a drink order, but then took a pretty long time to come back with it. We ordered the Paulie's pie (half sweet and half hot pepper's) and the rib appetizer. The ribs were really good - tender and flavorful - fall off the bone.  . The pizza was a mixed bag. I really enjoyed my sweet pepper half, except for the crust, which was much too charred (black and crumbly)for my taste. Bummer, cause I like to eat the crust. The boyfriend suffered though. The server should have issued a warning on those hot peppers because my orders-spice-level-8/10-at-a-Thai-place boyfriend thought they were too spicy to eat. He picked them off the last slice, but by then, the damage was done.  . Which brings me back to the overall service. Our server was very friendly, but clearly a little frazzled. The first round of drinks was slow, so we ordered round 2 when he dropped them. The ribs were served without plates, silver, or napkins (the manager rectified that). Round 2 of drinks also took forever, but he did pick it up with Round 3. About halfway through, we did notice that he had a big family with a ton of kids in the adjoining room that was very high-maintenance and monopolizing his time. I kind of felt back for him after that. The pizza was dropped by a runner, who didn't tell us how to distinguish between the sweet and hot side. Fortunately, we guessed right, as those hot peppers would have ruined my day.  . At the end of the day, it's a chain and it feels like a chain. I can give then a pass on the service since I saw the reason that happened and I saw the manager trying to help out. But the blackened crust isn't my favorite and I was longing for a few more appetizer choices.","I was pretty impressed with this place! It's a beautiful restaurant (and very clean as it is a relatively new location), the service was courteous and the food was delicious. I had the linguini with chicken and mushrooms which was very tasty. Decent portion sizes. . The menu is pretty extensive and covers many bases: pasta, pizza, burgers, salads, charcuterie, poutine, etc. They also have a nice drink menu including wine, beer and cocktails. For this reason I imagine it would be a good place for a group outing. . I would definitely recommend giving this place a try!","This place looked to have a good atmosphere. We stopped here for dinner because we didn't have reservations anywhere and they were able to get us right in. Awesome!  From there on though we were unimpressed. They say us right under a speaker so it was too loud to hold a conversation. The food was ok- not great, not bad. The steak was meat only so additional sides needed to be ordered if desired. Pizza was good and salad was good too. Service was SLOW.  Slow for waiter to greet us after we were seated, slow to get our drinks and food and once we were done it was slow to get our bill and cash out. We were not in a hurry but since we couldn't hold a conversation over the music and my water cup had long been dry we were ready to get our tab and cash out. Total bill was $70 for pizza, salad, steak and green beans. Overall it was ok but our service could have been much improved.","My husband went there last week and got an awesome meat lovers pizza. We went back today to try a supreme. We asked the bartender about removing 2 toppings and switch from black to green olives. I could not believe how rude they were. The girl who had obviously been there longer than the other girl, said \"no, we don't do that, you can't substitute\". We said we just want to remove 2 toppings and switch 1. She said \"we're going to charge you extra for a switched topping, there are NO substitutions or changes or you'll get charged more\". We felt totally un-welcomed and like they just didn't want to serve us. We said thanks and left. Never even got to try their pizza. Never again, the bartenders/waitresses that we dealt are probably the reason for all the previous bad reviews for service and not being friendly at all.","Not the greatest location and we probably would have never gone if it wasn't for their Groupon that was available. The pizza and calzones were really quite good. We also got the spaghetti and meatballs, delicious. I would recommend this place. I will say I didn't give it 5 stars cause of the slower service. Other than that a good choice.","Stumbled upon this lil gem! When we first arrived the band was very loud and we almost left, but luckily we decided to stay because we had a great time. The band was really great and a couple more drinks and you may have seen me do the polka!  Service was friendly and fast which always makes an experience all the more enjoyable. . Their happy hour specials on Saturday night can't be beat! My friend and I ordered a pizza to share and a martini a piece and spent under 8 dollars each! We ordered the sausage flatbread pizza and it was very tasty. Not super heavy and spicy like I was expecting. It was very mild, crispy, and the ricotta cheese really complimented the dish with its creamy, delicate flavor. Tasty! It was pretty busy on a Saturday night in the suburbs so kudos to them! The locations is kind of off the beaten path, but hey they are doing pretty well from the looks of it. . Overall, I'd say Bier haus offers great deals, a relaxing and fun atmosphere, and great service! Worth a stop and I hope to return soon!","Loving Longos in Applewood!!! . Bright new modern store. . . . Features I like are . The woodove pizza, french macaroons soo delish and pretty, biggest cheese section I have seen! Love all the specialty items, salad bar and starbucks!  I can't wait to plan a fancy dinner party now I have this store in walking distance! (Parking is a little crazy)","I've only ordered one item from this place, though I've been here several times. . It's a nice little take out that is busy no matter what time I go in. The one thing I always get is the vegan pizza. It has a thin crust and is loaded with eggplant, onions, dollops of creamy spinach and other vegetables. It's pretty incredible, especially for someone who can't get a cheeseless slice of pizza anywhere else. It's not the best pizza I ever had, but it's a fast, cheap ($4) alternative to the more expensive lunches in the area. . They also have a little salad bar, and the staff is always pretty friendly.","Pizza here is phenomenal, great crust, generous fresh toppings. I'm down in Woodbine from the NW to house-sit and will need to make special trips from the NW for this pizza!","I've been to all 3 of Chris' places now and they're all equally amazing, but this one is by far my favorite. Was craving some hometown goodness and we ordered the chicken finger sub and pizza rolls. He wanted a beef on weck as well, but the sub alone is really filling so we'll come back to get that next time. They have Loganberry on tap and if you don't know what it is, you can thank me later when you order it. It's a cross between grape juice and fruit punch. Very good with vodka. The menu is not your ordinary pub fare either. They do have pizza, subs, wings, fingers, and some fried foods, but where else will you find bacon risotto? Foie Gras tacos, and other unique items off a Chef's menu? Great job Chris!","Where do I begin with this train wreck? Let's start with the food so you don't think this is just from bad service. Had a group of 6, ordered wings, cheese curds, some kinda pizza dip thing, and these steak and onion fries. The wings were over cooked plain wings with sauces on the side. Terrible wings, with an impossible to cover up side sauce. You could dip a little, but with a table of 6, you certainly didn't want to double dip. The cheese curds were the worst. Frozen, then overcooked crap. The pizza sauce thing was ok, but the \"chips\" that came with it were stale. Finally, the steak and onion fries were good. Tasty even. But since the waitress never brought silverware, we could barely eat these. . Ah, but that service. All started well, and then went way off the rails. We got the first round of drinks ok. Shortly thereafter we ordered food. Took a bit long, but we were socializing, so not too bad. Second round of apps ordered, and more drinks, and it was awful. Took 45 min. Yes, 45 min for 3 apps. Drinks? Well, all ordered, she delivered 3 about 10 min after ordering. Not sure what happened to other 3, took her 10 min before she returned. By then, asked about missing 3, and someone else ordered another. She returned close to 10 min later, with 2 drinks, one missing; one new. Now, we are only missing 2 of the original second order. Finally, one of our party went to the bar to ask bartender about our server since she'd completely disappeared. Bartender was rude and explained that she had gone to get out food. . . at another restaurant in the the casino. WTH?  When she finally returned from her quest to get our food, she still had no drinks. Two of us asked for water. She returned about 5 min later with only 1 water. After 5 min I went to the bar to get the water and specifically asked our server for the water. Her response. . . \"oh, I didn't bring it?\"  Kinda summed up her crap performance and the crap food. . The final issue with this crap show. . . when we scoped this out to see if our crew would like to hang out here, the bartender told us about Monday Night Football drink and app specials. When we arrived, server never told us anything about them. . Stay away. Not worth the time and frustration.","I can't believe it took me so long to finally try this place, but I sure am glad I did! The Fish Store has been around for a while and they serve quality fish dishes with fresh ingredients (you can actually see the raw fish on ice). If you are in Little Italy and looking for something fast, yet healthy, this is your best option. Most of the other places around here are shawarma/pizza/burrito places. . They have a variety of different kinds of fish including some really fancy ones like black cod. For any fish, they grill it fresh to order and you can have it as a sandwich, salad, burrito, or over rice. They don't overseason it, so you can really taste the flavour of the fish. I had the haddock salad ($9. 99) and it came over a huge portion of mixed romaine and baby spinach with lots of veggies. In addition to fish, they have soups and cold drinks. Be sure to check out the daily special too!. The staff are really friendly. Not much seating area, especially in the winter once the patio is closed, just 2 small tables. Most people get take-out. On a Friday night after work when I went, it was very busy! Seems like there are lots of regulars. . There are so many fish &amp; chips places in the city, but for anyone who wants fast fresh fish without all the grease, this place can't be beat! Prices are very reasonable too! I'm a fan!. NB: Cash only!","I have been hearing rave reviews from friends and have yet to been. Was over on this side town and figured it was the perfect time. We ordered buffalo wings and a large pizza with 1/2 cheese and 1/2 pepperoni and banana peppers. The pizza came out first. The crust was a slightly thicker than I find at other NY style places but this made it nice and crispy and it held up, so if you like your pizza loaded this crust can handle. The cheese was fresh and full of flavor, sauce was perfectly seasoned and not overly sweet and a good ratio of sauce to cheese. While the pizza was excellent hot and fresh from the over, I enjoyed it even more after it sat in the fridge at home. The wings came out next, they were super hot and smothered in spicy buffalo sauce. They were cooked to perfection, nice and crispy even with the sauce all over it. I would recommend checking this place out for sure, they had a good menu variety with sandwiches, calzones and Italian dishes so there is something for everybody. I have a chicken parm or meatball sub in my future!","We ate here twice last week for lunch. It taste almost exactly like the secret pizza at cosmo. I don't think they have a ricotta pizza but the dough taste the same. Same NY style, thin &amp; soft not crispy but very DELICIOUS! But way cheaper @ 1. 75 per piece and closer to my work. . We tried 1 large pizza half pepperoni/half sausage. and pepperoni is naturally oily but I like it. Some don't but it was yum nevertheless. We will back to try this week and maybe the philly w/cheese wiz.","I don't know what it is about this place, but I prefer it over Domino's, Pizza Hut, Pizza Pit, and other such pizza chains. I have no problem with their crust. I think it's better than what Pizza Hut has been putting out for the last thirty years. Topping selection isn't great, but at least it's focused like the rest of the menu. If you want to throw everything and the kitchen sink on your pizza, you might want to look elsewhere. . Got a salad one time. It was as good as you expect from this sort of place, i. e. a pile of lettuce with what amounts to pizza toppings. I will say the service here seems a step above certain other chains. As in, the employees don't look so angry and depressed. Their service for both carryout and delivery has been pretty good in my experience. Overall, this has become my go-to pizza place for cheap pies, especially when they're cheaper than Pizza Hut or Dominos, even without using a coupon.","Vitos . Shitty lil strip mall. . . good pizza. . I had been driving around for a new place to check out, since it feels like forever since I reviewed anywhere. I miss ma Yelp. . place #1 closed for the day . place #2 appeared to be closed down . Desperate and hungry i found Vitos via Yelp and was ahh what ev. . . . I ordered the thick crust and listened to other yelpers talk shit about coworkers, chatted with a guy from Surprise and waited. . The pizza was good, sauce was a bit salty but I liked it. The crust was thick chewy on the inside and crispy on the bottom. It was good. . After 2 slices and one more bit of the corner of one more slice, I packed the rest to go. The neighbor kid was walking by as I drove up so he was in for a good snack as I gave him the left overs. . Would I go back? Maybe if I were in the area or suggesting it to someone but it is not better then Barros to me. Sorry.","Corey has 5 star customer service skills and the pizza was on point! Best Papa John's around!!","Service was extremely SLOW only one server, my family was halfway done w/ dinner before I got my cold pizza, asked for fettuccini Alfredo but got  fettuccini noodles with red sauce,  never got drink refills, took 15 minutes to get my check and the owner just sitting at bar could care less. . . when I was a server food would never just sit under heat lamp if server was busy cook, owner, busser SOMEONE took food out. . . . Won't be back again we my family wanted Olive Garden but I thought no way this small non chain place will be better boy I guess I was wrong. . . . . Go to Taco Bell across the street you will get better service","Great pizza. Definitely has it's hat in the ring for best in the city.","The only reason why this place deserves a star is because there pizza isn't all that bad. . . But I was on the phone with the lady trying to order a large cheese pizza and plain wings. She couldn't get the order right. I asked her to repeat it back to me and she did correctly. . . We received our pizza but the wings were depending in hot sauce. The guy said to just keep them. He comes back with the right order but asks for the other wings back. . . Lol!! Uh what? We weren't eating them anyways. But seriously ridiculous.","More than a cafe. . . . I've passed by this place numerous times, never knowing what it was. They have a large menu, more than I expected anyway, with salads, pasta, calzones. And a wine list :) and a gelato bar, tons of pastries and of course, coffee. . The atmosphere is a bit stark, it's a huge space, would be nice if it was a bit cosier. It certainly fills up (and I was there on an early Monday evening). . I ordered what I think is called a Pandolci - Parma ham, cheese, arugula (or some green leafy veg) all wrapped up in a thin pizza dough. It was yummy. My friend was very pleased with her pasta. The gelato was great. . A great find!","We were looking for a place to grab a quick bite &amp; found New York pizza. I had a meatball sub &amp; my husband had the chicken parmigiana sub- both were excellent.  12\" subs with fries for a very reasonable price. We wrapped 1/2 of each sub to take with us, but splurged on dessert- tiramisu and cannoli. Again, fantastic! The staff was extremely busy, but not too busy to check on us to be sure everything was ok. If in Charlotte again, New York Pizza will be my 1st stop","This has the greatest pizza. . . And I hate thin crust pizza with a passion! But this was the closest place in a new place so we gave it a try. . The pizza is so flavorful! I really can't express the greatness of this pizza it's easily 6 stars. . . Along with the host, he was so nice. The happy hour half price house wine would have been nice but she didn't ring it up correctly. . . The only reason this review is not 5 stars is the service. I mean holy shit! I have never seen a waitress so unable to make eye contact or smile, let alone even consider making any small talk. She even took my water cup and didn't even ask if I wanted more. . 1. 5 slices through our pizza she asks if we want a box. . . 10 min after it came out. . The place is. After we ordered desert she has someone else bring it out. . We were the only table. Then she drops of check I say thank you. . She walks away with out a word. . FYI I'm a great tipper min 20% this is the only time I will be leaving a shitty tip. We will get take out if we come back!","Still feeling mediocre about this place. I gave it another shot and was pleased with the mozzarella sticks but less than excited about the pizza. It was barely warm, skimped on the topping, and really floppy (I don't know how else to describe it).","We ate at Sauce for their 2 for $20 summer deal yesterday for lunch. We ordered the caesar salad (which was a good portion for 2 to share), the chicken pesto pizza (which by the way is a white pizza, we didnt find this out until it came to our table but the manager offered to add pizza sauce to it which made it even better) and two glasses of wine. Sauce is a good place that I tend to forget about because the pizza is in my opinion forgetable. The staff was nice and prompt which lead me to give the 4 star rating.","Save your time and money. . . the pizza and service used to be good and I keep trying to give chance after chance. They NEVER give the amount of toppings you pay for and the service is slow. I have complained, been promised it will get better, and then. . . . nothing. I paid for extra mushrooms (again) and this time to be safe because we all wanted extra mushrooms and had guests we paid for TRIPLE MUSHROOM ($4. 00 extra on a $16 pizza) . I have 6 slices that have 1 mushroom on the slice. I've included the picture after the 45 minute wait for the pizza","My husband and I ordered some take out from here the other night and I have to say we found our new pizza place and can't wait to dine in one day!. We had the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer (delicious) and a large hawaiian pizza. The pizza was amazing! We ordered the large which was HUGE and I have to say it is probably the best pizza I have had outside of Chicago. . They were willing to set up a pizza cookie Togo for us for dessert which I thought was incredibly nice since many Italian restaurants only let you order it if you dine in. . Fantastic food, great price!","Went for dinner, wasn't too crowded and sat down right away. Our server was really polite and pleasant. We ordered the margarita pizza, pepperoni, and chicken. We ordered the 3 pizzas for 5 people and it was the perfect amount (each 11 inches) The margarita one was outstanding and would highly recommend. I would highly recommend this restaurant for the pizza.","I still remember the first time I went to Joe's Farm Grill. It was a mild May evening and we decided to eat outside. The idea of farm fresh foods really appealed to me. I am always beyond satisfied with my meal. I don't think there has been a time that I have been there that I didn't order a barbecue chicken pizza. I am not a fan of most novelty pizzas, but this one is just amazing. I'm pretty sure the bbq sauce they use, is the same one they use at Joe's Real BBQ.  The enormous tree behind the Farm Grill is sick and we always crack jokes about the sign about falling and scorpions. The line can be a little long, but they are quick at the order window and it is definitely worth the wait. Don't forget to try them for breakfast as well, mmm breakfast tacos. . . Do yourself a favor and walk off that delicious meal through the farm and sneak a grape (when they are in season) that grow on the arbors and fences. Enjoy and remember to eat local","NOT WORTH THE $$$ Had this pizza for the first time the other day at a work function. Decided I'd get one delivered. 3. 9 miles away $5 out of area fee. WTF! ONE 16\" 2 topping with a side of ranch came out to $27. That's ridiculous. Could have gotten an XL 3 topping plus 12 wings at Barro's for the same price. Will not be odering from here again.","The soho is the vegan choice. Great pizza. The service is always great as well. . . been here a couple of times and I have been very pleased both times. Brought my vegan pizza lover friend, who loved it as well. She had no complaints. I will definitely recommend this poace to pizza lovers and downtowners","The food was absolutely wonderful! We have almost gotten to the point where we didn't want to go out to eat anymore because we were always so disappointed with the food. Red White and Brew delivered with service and amazing food. We started out with the asparagus fries ( delicious!) and then shared a Chicago pizza. We will definitely be coming back!","I received 50% off of my pizza here tonight and it was absolutely gross! I hate to say this but even Little Ceasars or the dreaded Dominoes could do better. The pizza reminded me of one of those . 99 cent tv dinner pizzas that had gone bad.
