## Topic Modeling in Yelp

One of my favorite things in this wonderful pale blue dot is pizza. Arguably my first real love, pizza has taught me some of the most important things to learn in life. Beyond having incredibly easy dinner suggestions (good pizza will ALWAYS make that list), I was fortunate enough to gain some foundational business experience having managed a local pizza shop in cozy St. Cloud MN as a teen. I have only been to New York City once in my life. I was only there for a weekend and of course pizza had to be a crucial part of the trip. Knowing where to go was really easy thanks to my graduate school percussion teacher at the time who tipped me off to such greats as Lombardos, World of Pizza, and Angelos. In addition to spending time with friends, the awesome food suggestions made the trip that much more memorable and fun. I love checking out local pizza spots when I travel, but the problem is that I am usually really rushed when I am traveling so I don't have time to scoure through yelp reviews individualy to find reviews that are relevant to what I want at a given time. For this post I am going to subset the YELP 10th ACADEMIC DATASET to reviews related to pizza and explore the topic modeling space.
